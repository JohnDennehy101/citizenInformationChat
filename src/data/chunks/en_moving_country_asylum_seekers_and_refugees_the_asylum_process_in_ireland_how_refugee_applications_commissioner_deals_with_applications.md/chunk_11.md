##  International protection interview

The personal interview is your chance to tell the IPO about why you left your
country, the things you have experienced or seen and why you are afraid to
return. You should be interviewed in a language that you can understand.

The case worker will write down the information you give at this interview.
Make sure they read it back to you so you can check that it is accurate. You
can ask for the document to be corrected if you think you have been
misunderstood, or you wish to give more details about something.

You might have to talk about things that have happened to you or your family
that are upsetting for you to talk about. If you have a solicitor with you,
they cannot answer questions on your behalf.

There may not be a personal interview if the international protection officer
considers that:

  * You should be declared a refugee without needing to be interviewed 
  * You are under 18 and not mature enough for an interview to help with the examination of your application 
  * You are unfit or unable to be interviewed due to enduring circumstances beyond your control
