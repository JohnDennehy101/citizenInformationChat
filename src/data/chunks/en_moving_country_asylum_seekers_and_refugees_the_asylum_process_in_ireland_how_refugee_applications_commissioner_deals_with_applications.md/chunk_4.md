###  Already granted refugee status or with sufficient protection in another
country

An application is inadmissible if another EU country has granted you refugee
status or subsidiary protection.

It is also inadmissible if you were granted refugee status in a country
outside the EU and that protection is still available to you, or you enjoy
sufficient protection in that country. Sufficient protection includes
protection against torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment.
