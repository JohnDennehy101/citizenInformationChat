###  EU Dublin Regulation

Your application may be assessed under the [ EU Dublin Regulation
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/dublin-convention/) if it appears that your international protection
application should be dealt with by another Member State. This can happen at
any stage of your application. The EU Dublin Regulation sets out the rules
about which country is responsible for a personâ€™s international protection
application.

The IPO will tell you that it is examining your application under the EU
Dublin Regulation and you can make written representations to the Chief
International Protection Officer.
