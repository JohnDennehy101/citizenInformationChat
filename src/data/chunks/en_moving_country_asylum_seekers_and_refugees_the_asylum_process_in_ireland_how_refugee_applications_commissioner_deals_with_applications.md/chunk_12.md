##  Recommendation of the international protection officer

Following the interview, the international protection officer prepares a
written report with their recommendation. The 3 options for the recommendation
are:

  * That you should be declared a [ refugee ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-introduction#lad40a)
  * That you should be declared a person with [ subsidiary protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-introduction#l50016)
  * That you should not be declared either a refugee or a person with subsidiary protection 

The IPO sends its report to the Minister for Justice, who then sends you a
written notification of the recommendation.

If the international protection officer recommends that you should be given a
refugee declaration or subsidiary protection declaration, the Minister for
Justice will [ follow this recommendation in most cases ](/en/moving-
country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/minister-
for-justice/) .

If the IPO recommends that you should not be given a refugee or subsidiary
protection declaration, you can [ appeal to the International Protection
Appeals Tribunal ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-
process-in-ireland/if-your-application-for-refugee-status-is-refused/) if you
want to. If you do not appeal, or your appeal is not successful, the Minister
will decide if you should be granted [ permission to remain ](/en/moving-
country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/refugee-status-and-leave-to-
remain/permission-to-remain/) in Ireland or not.
