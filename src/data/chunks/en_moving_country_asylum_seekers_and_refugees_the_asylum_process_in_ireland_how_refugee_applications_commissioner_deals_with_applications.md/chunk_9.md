###  Evidence of persecution or serious harm

If you have already been subject to persecution or serious harm, you may not
have documentary or other evidence to support this. In this situation, the
international protection officer will not need confirmation of this if
convinced that:

  * You made a genuine effort to prove what you said in your application 
  * You provided all the evidence you had available and gave a reasonable explanation for not having other relevant evidence 
  * Your statements were coherent and plausible 
  * If you did not apply for international protection at the earliest possible time, you gave a reasonable explanation for not doing so 
  * Your general credibility has been established
