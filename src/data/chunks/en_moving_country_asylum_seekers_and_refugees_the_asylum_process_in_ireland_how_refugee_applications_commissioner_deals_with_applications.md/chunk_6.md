###  Decisions on admissibility

If the IPO recommends that your application should be inadmissible, it sends a
report to the Minister for Justice. The Minister must inform you (and your
legal representative) of the recommendation and give you a copy of the report
that was prepared by the IPO. You can appeal this recommendation to the
International Protection Appeals Tribunal within 10 working days.

If the appeal is not successful, or you do not appeal against the
recommendation, your international protection application will be closed.

If your application is admissible, the IPO will continue to examine it and you
will be sent a questionnaire to complete.
