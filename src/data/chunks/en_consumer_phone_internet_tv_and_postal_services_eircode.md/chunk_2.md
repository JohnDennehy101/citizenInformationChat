##  What is Eircode?

Eircode is the national postcode system in Ireland.

An Eircode is a unique 7-character code consisting of letters and numbers.
Each Eircode consists of a 3-character _routing key_ to identify the area and
a 4-character _unique identifier_ for each address. A typical Eircode might
read A65 F4E2.

All residential and business addresses have , which in some cases can be the
name of an individual, particularly for small businesses or sole traders.

Residential addresses include every address where post is delivered. Each
house on a street, each flat in an apartment block, each unit in a duplex unit
and each house in a rural townland has an Eircode.

In a halting site with numbered bays, each bay has been given an Eircode. The
Eircode belongs to that bay and not to the caravan. If a halting site has an
office that receives mail, the office address will get an Eircode.
