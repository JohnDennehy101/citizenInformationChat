##  My postal address is wrong on the Eircode Finder

Eircode canâ€™t change the postal address information on the Eircode Finder
unless An Post GeoDirectory tells them to.

If your address is wrong in the Eircode Finder, you should continue using the
address you normally use and simply add the Eircode. If your postal address is
incorrect, you can contact to [ An Post Customer Services
](https://www.anpost.com/Customer-Charter/Feedback-Complaints) to have your
postal address reviewed.
