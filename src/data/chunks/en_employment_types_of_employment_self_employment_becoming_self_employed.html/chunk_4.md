##  How to become a sole trader

If you choose to become a sole trader, you are self-employed and you do not
have a business partner. This means you are personally responsible for the
business. So, if the business fails, your personal assets can be used to repay
any loans to your creditors.

To legally become a sole trader, you must [ register as self-employed with
Revenue ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-business/registering-for-
tax/how-to-register-for-tax-as-a-sole-trader.aspx) . Once you have registered,

system (which is used for employees).

As a self-employed sole trader, you become eligible for certain tax reliefs.
