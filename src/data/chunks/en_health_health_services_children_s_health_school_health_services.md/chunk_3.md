##  How do school health screenings work?

School health screenings are conducted by [ public health nurses
](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-community/public-health-nurses/) and
area medical officers who are employed by the HSE.

The screenings take place in the school and the principal is told in advance
so that parents can be notified. You will be asked to sign a consent form
before the health check.

Your child's hearing and vision are tested and a physical examination may be
carried out.
