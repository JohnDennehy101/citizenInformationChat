###  **Am I eligible for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)** **too?**

No, you cannot get the SSP on top of the benefits from your employer’s scheme.

If your employer has their own sick pay scheme that offers more generous
benefits than SSP, you should be paid under those arrangements. The SSP is for
employees who don’t have a company sick pay scheme or don’t qualify for it.
