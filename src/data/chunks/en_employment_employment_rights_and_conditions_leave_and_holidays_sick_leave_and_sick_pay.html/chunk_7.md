###  **Length of service**

To qualify for statutory sick pay, you need to have worked continuously for
your employer for at least 13 weeks.

If you leave your job and return to the same employer within 26 weeks, this
gap does not count towards the 13-week requirement. It's treated as if you
never left, so your service is still counted as continuous.
