##  Introduction

**Since 1 January 2024** , you have a right to 5 days’ sick pay a year
(increased from 3 days in 2023). This is called _statutory sick pay_ (that
means the legal minimum). **Sick pay is paid by your employer** at 70% of your
normal pay up to a maximum of €110 a day.

You must be an employee and be working at least 13 weeks with your employer
before you can get statutory sick pay.

Your employer can have a more generous sick pay scheme, but they can't give
you less than the statutory amount.
