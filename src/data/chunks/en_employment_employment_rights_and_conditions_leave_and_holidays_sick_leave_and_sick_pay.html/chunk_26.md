###  What happens to my annual leave when I am off sick?

If you are sick during your [ annual leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-
and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-leave/) and get a medical certificate
for those days, they will not be counted as annual leave days. Your employer
cannot insist you take annual leave on days you are off sick and have a
medical certificate.

You can continue to build up your annual leave entitlement while you are off
sick, once you have a medical certificate.

If you are on long-term sick leave and cannot take your annual leave due to
illness, you can carry it over for up to 15 months after the end of the year
you built it up. If you leave your job within these 15 months, you should get
holiday pay instead of the annual leave days you could not take due to
illness.
