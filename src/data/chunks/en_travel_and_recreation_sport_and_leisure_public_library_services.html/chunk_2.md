##  Introduction

Local authorities run a network of public libraries in Ireland. Public
libraries are open to everyone and most of their services are free.

You can use some library services without becoming a member.

You need to join the library if you want to:

  * Borrow books or other items 
  * Access online magazine and newspaper subscriptions, or 
  * Take online courses 

You no longer have to pay fines for late returns. All previous unpaid fines
have been cancelled.

This page tells you about the services available at a library and how you can
become a member.
