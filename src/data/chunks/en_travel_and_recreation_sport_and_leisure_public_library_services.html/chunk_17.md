Some libraries have extended their opening hours through the [ My Open
Libraries programme

. These libraries are open from 8am to 10pm every day of the year. This
extended service is only available to members, and children (under 16) must be
accompanied by an adult.

During unstaffed hours, an automated service is available, which can be
accessed by using your library card and pin.
