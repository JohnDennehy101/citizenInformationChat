##  What is the part-time fee scheme?

The part-time fee scheme is a new financial support scheme for students
studying certain part-time undergraduate courses in Ireland and abroad.

The scheme provides fee support to eligible part-time students doing [
specified undergraduate courses ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-
criteria/approved-courses/undergraduate-students-approved-institutions---part-
time-courses/) leading to a major award with a minimum average of 30 credits
and maximum of 50 credits per academic year. The number of credits undertaken
during the academic year will determine the funding available to you for that
year (see ‘How much will I get?’ below).

The scheme is available to students currently studying on an approved course,
or students starting an approved course for the first time in the 2024/2025
academic year.

The scheme only offers support with fees and is not a maintenance grant.

Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) is the awarding authority for the
scheme.
