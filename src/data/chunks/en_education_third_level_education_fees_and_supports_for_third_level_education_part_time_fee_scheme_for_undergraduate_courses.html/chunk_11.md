##  How much will I get?

You get a fee contribution based on the number of credits you take during the
academic year. SUSI pays the contribution directly to your college.

If your course costs more than the maximum amount you are eligible for, you
will pay the difference. If your course costs less than the maximum amount you
are eligible for, you do not receive the difference.

For example, if you are doing a course worth 16 credits which costs €3,000,
SUSI will pay your college €2,250 and you will pay the balance of €750 to your
college.

If you are doing a course worth 16 credits which costs €1,400, SUSI will pay
your college €1,400.
