###  Sickness and disability

If you become sick and cannot work temporarily, your employer in Northern
Ireland should pay you [ Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)
](https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay) for up to 28 weeks. If this is your
only income, you can apply for [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) in Ireland
to top up this payment.

You can claim [ Employment and Support Allowance
](https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance) if you are unable to work
due to illness or disability and your SSP has finished or you are not entitled
to SSP.

If you have to give up your job because of a sickness or disability, you may
be entitled to [ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/invalidity-pension/) in Ireland. This is based on your PRSI
contributions and you can only apply for it if you have worked in Ireland some
time in your life. If you have only worked in Ireland for a short period, you
will only be able to get a small amount of Invalidity Pension.

[ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-
allowance/) is a payment for people who have a disability or illness that
substantially restricts them from doing work that would be suitable for a
person of their age, experience and qualifications. Disability Allowance is
means tested and paid to people who are [ habitually resident ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-
residence-condition/) in Ireland.
