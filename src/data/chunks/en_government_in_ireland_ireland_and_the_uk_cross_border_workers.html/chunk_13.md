##  Tax

If you are living in Ireland and working in Northern Ireland, your tax and
national insurance (this is like PRSI in Ireland) is deducted from your pay.

You also have to make an annual self-assessment to Revenue in Ireland. Ireland
and the UK have a double taxation agreement, which means that you will get a
credit for the tax that you already paid in the UK. This makes sure that you
won’t have to pay tax twice. But you may have to pay extra tax in Ireland
based on the difference in the tax rates between the two countries, and also
based on the earnings of your spouse if you have one.

You should apply for [ Transborder Workers’ Relief
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-
exemptions/income-and-employment/trans-border-workers-relief/index.aspx) in
Ireland.

You may be entitled to [ tax credits in the UK ](https://www.gov.uk/tax-
credits-if-moving-country-or-travelling/crossborder-workers) based on how much
income you have. UK tax credits is a payment made to workers on low income,
and is different to tax credits in Ireland, which are used to calculate how
much tax you have to pay.
