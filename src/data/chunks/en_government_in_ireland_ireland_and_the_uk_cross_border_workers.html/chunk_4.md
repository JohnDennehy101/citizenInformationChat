##  Who can live in Ireland and work in Northern Ireland?

Irish and British citizens can continue to live and work on both sides of the
border. This is because Ireland and the UK are part of the [ Common Travel
Area ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/common-travel-area-
between-ireland-and-the-uk/) , which gives Irish and British citizens the
right to live and access services in both countries.
