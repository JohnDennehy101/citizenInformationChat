###  Pensions

Contributions made in Northern Ireland and Ireland can be combined when you
are applying for your pension. You may also be entitled to a pension from both
countries.

If you have made contributions in both Ireland and Northern Ireland (or other
parts of the UK, or other parts of the EEA) you can apply to the pension
office in the country where you live when you reach pension age.
