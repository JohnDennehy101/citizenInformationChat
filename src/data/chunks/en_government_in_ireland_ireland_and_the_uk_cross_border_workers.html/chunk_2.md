##  Introduction

The rules about cross border working on the island of Ireland have changed for
some people because Northern Ireland is [ no longer part of the EU
](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/what-is-brexit/) .

Irish citizens can continue to live and work in Northern Ireland and the rest
of the UK. British citizens can live and work in Ireland. Both Irish and UK
citizens can live in Ireland and work in Northern Ireland (or live in Northern
Ireland and work in Ireland).

If you are an EEA citizen (the EU, plus Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein) and
you were living in Ireland and working in Northern Ireland before the end of
2020, you had to apply for a Frontier Worker Permit to continue working in
Northern Ireland after 1 July 2021.

If you are an EEA citizen (not Irish) who lived in Northern Ireland before 31
December 2020 you had to apply for the [ EU Settlement Scheme
](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families) to continue living
in Northern Ireland.

EEA citizens (not Irish) who start working in Northern Ireland for the first
time after the end of 2020, must apply through the UK Points Based Immigration
System [ UK points based immigration scheme ](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-
immigration-system-what-you-need-to-know) .
