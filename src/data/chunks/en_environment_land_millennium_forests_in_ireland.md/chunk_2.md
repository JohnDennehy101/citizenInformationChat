##  Introduction

Forestry in Ireland has been severely affected by clearance and exploitation.
The total forest area in Ireland is 11.6% of the landscape. Around 49.1% of
this is in public ownership, mainly [ Coillte ](https://www.coillte.ie/) .

Just under 2% of Irish forestry is native forestry.

Carefully planted and managed forests increase the areaâ€™s [ biodiversity
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/pets-and-
wildlife/protection-of-nature-and-biodiversity/) , creating a huge range of
habitats for wild fauna and flora.

Managing and using forests in a way that maintains their rich variety of life
forms, their economic and social functions and their capacity to re-grow is
called sustainable forest management. Trees are planted, allowed to mature,
harvested, then re-planted and naturally re-generated in a continuous growth
cycle.

Farm forestry provides an alternative income that helps sustain farming
communities, promotes rural development and enables people to remain on their
land.

Many different grants are available for people who want to plant trees.
