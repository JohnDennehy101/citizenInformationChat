##  Introduction

In the interest of safety, cyclists must obey the [ rules of the road
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/resources/rules-of-the-road) .
As a cyclist, you are particularly vulnerable and face a real risk of serious
injury or death if you are involved in an accident.

You are legally obliged to keep your bike in good working order. You must
cycle with reasonable consideration, and be sober enough to control your bike.

If you ride a bike on a public road in Ireland, it must be fitted with
reflectors and lights to ensure that you are visible. All bikes on public
roads must comply with the [ Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations
1963 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1963/en/si/0189.html) (as amended). This
law sets down the type of reflectors and lights your bike must have and when
you must use your bike lights. See our page on [ Bicycle lights ](/en/travel-
and-recreation/cycling/lighting-of-bicycles-in-ireland/) for more information.

In addition to lights, your bike must also have:

  * A bell, which can be heard from a reasonable distance 
  * Front and rear brakes (unless it has one fixed wheel, where it needs only one brake) 
  * A rear reflector that can be seen from a reasonable distance
