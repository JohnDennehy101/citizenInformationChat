###  Am I legally obliged to use cycle lanes?

You must use a cycle lane in a pedestrianised area where an appropriate one is
provided.

Where the cycle lane is a contra-flow cycle lane (allowing cyclists to go in
the opposite direction to the traffic on a one-way street), you can only cycle
in the contra-flow direction.

The regulation on cycle lanes is contained in [ Article 14 of the Road Traffic
(Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) Regulations 1997, as amended
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/si/182/made/en/print#article14) .
