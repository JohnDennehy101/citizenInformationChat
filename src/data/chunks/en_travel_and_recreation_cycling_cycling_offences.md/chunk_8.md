###  What are the rules about overtaking cyclists?

When overtaking, it is recommended that drivers should leave 1.5 metres
between them and your bicycle in areas with speed limits above 50km/h. In
areas with lower speed limits, drivers should allow one metre when overtaking.

It is a [ separate offence
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/si/495/made/en/print) to overtake a
cyclist dangerously. Drivers who overtake you dangerously while you are
cycling are liable for a fixed charge of â‚¬120, and could have 3 [ penalty
points ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-points-
for-driving-offences/) added to their licence.
