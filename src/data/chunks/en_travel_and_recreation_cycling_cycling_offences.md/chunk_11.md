###  Is it legal to cycle on a footpath?

You are not allowed to cycle on a footpath unless there is a designated cycle
lane on the footpath or you are entering or exiting a property. Cycling on a
footpath is not a specific fixed charge offence though. However, you could be
fined for doing so if a garda deemed their cycling to be without ’ _reasonable
consideration_ ‘.

Similarly, you cannot cycle in a pedestrianized area at the designated times
unless there is a cycle lane.
