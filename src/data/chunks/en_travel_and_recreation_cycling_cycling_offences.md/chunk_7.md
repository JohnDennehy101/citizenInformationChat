###  Can I overtake a vehicle on the inside?

A cyclist can overtake a vehicle on the left (or inside of the flow of
traffic) if the vehicles to the right are stationary or moving more slowly
than the cyclist.

However as a cyclist you cannot overtake on the inside if the vehicle you
intend to overtake:

  * Is signalling an intention to turn to the left and will move to the left before you overtake it 
  * Is stationary to allow a passenger to alight or board the vehicle 
  * Is stationary for the purposes of loading or unloading
