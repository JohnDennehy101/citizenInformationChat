###  What steps can I take to prevent my bike from being stolen?

Gardaí advise people to spend a minimum of 10 to 20 per cent of the cost of
their bike on 2 bike locks. They also recommend that you should:

  * Lock your bike tightly to an immovable object like a bike stand or lamppost 
  * Keep the lock off the ground 
  * Lock your bike in-doors or in a well-lit public area if possible 
  * Photograph and keep a note of your bike’s serial number 
  * Always report a bike theft to the Gardaí 

According to Garda figures, the most common time a bike is stolen is during
daylight, between 8am and 5pm.
