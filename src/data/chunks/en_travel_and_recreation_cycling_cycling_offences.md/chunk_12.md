###  Is there a legal alcohol limit for cycling?

If a Garda suspects you are cycling under the influence of alcohol or drugs to
the point that you do not have proper control of the bike, you can be arrested
without a warrant. This is also the case if a Garda has reasonable grounds to
suspect you are riding a stolen bike.
