###  What other rules of the road apply to cyclists?

The [ Road Traffic Acts 1961 (as amended)
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1961/act/24/front/revised/en/html) set
out the main provisions for motoring and legislation for bikes. There is also
secondary legislation including the [ Road Traffic Acts and Road Traffic
(Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997-2019
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/si/182/made/en/print) , which
regulates the behaviour of motorists and cyclists.

When cycling you must:

  * Stop at traffic lights when required 
  * Stop at pedestrian crossings and zebra crossings 
  * Stop at cycle traffic lights when required 
  * Stop at stop signs and yield the right of way at yield signs 
  * Avoid cycling on motorways 

[ Section 100 of the Road Traffic Act 1961
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1961/en/act/pub/0024/sec0100.html#sec100)
makes it an offence to ride a bicycle while holding on to another moving
vehicle (other than another bicycle which no one is riding).
