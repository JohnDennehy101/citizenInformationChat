Have you set up an annual direct debit to pay your [ Local Property Tax (LPT)
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) ?

If so, the full payment will be taken from your bank account on **21 March
2024** , unless you set an earlier date for the payment.

An annual Local Property Tax (LPT) is charged on residential properties in
Ireland. You are liable for LPT in 2024 if you owned a residential property on
1 November 2023.

If you paid your LPT for 2023 with a repeating payment method, such as a
direct debit, the payment will continue in 2024 unless you choose a different
way to pay.
