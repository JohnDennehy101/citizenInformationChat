##  Taking time off work

There are different reasons you might need time off work, for example:

  * If you have a family crisis, like a sudden illness in your family 
  * If you are called for jury service 
  * If you want to take study leave or a career break 

In some cases, you are entitled to be paid for your leave, but in others you
are not.
