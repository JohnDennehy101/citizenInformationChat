###  How to apply for force majeure leave

You must tell your employer as soon as possible that you need to take force
majeure leave.

As soon as you return to work, you must make your application **in writing**
to your employer.

Your written application should include:

  * Your name 
  * PPS number 
  * Employer’s name and address 
  * Date(s) you took force majeure leave and the reasons why 
  * Your relationship to the person who was injured or ill 

Your employer may have a specific ‘force majeure form’ that they want you to
complete.

Your contract may also require you to provide a medical certificate as proof
of the sudden illness or injury (you can request this from the doctor).
