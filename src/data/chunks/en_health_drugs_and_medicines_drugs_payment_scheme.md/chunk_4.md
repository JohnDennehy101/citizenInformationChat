##  How the Drugs Payment Scheme works

After you register for the scheme, you will get a plastic swipe card for each
person named on the registration form. You should show this card whenever you
collect your medication or appliances from the pharmacy.

The HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service provides a [ list of medicines or
aids provided under the Drugs Payment Scheme
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/staff/pcrs/items/) . Appliances covered include
positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine and rental costs for oxygen.

If a [ reference price ](/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/prescribed-drugs-and-
medicines#lb8942) has been set for the drugs you are prescribed, the HSE uses
this price to calculate your monthly drugs costs.
