##  Other grants and schemes

If you do not qualify for the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a
Disability, or it is not suitable for the work you need to get done, you may
qualify for other grants or schemes.

If you just need basic work to make your home more accessible, you can apply
for the means-tested [ Mobility Aids Grant Scheme ](/en/housing/housing-
grants-and-schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-and-people-with-
disabilities/mobility-aids-grant-scheme/) .

If you are an older person and you need essential repairs to your home, the [
Housing Aid for Older People Grant ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-and-people-with-
disabilities/housing-aid-for-older-people-grant/) may be more suitable for
you. These schemes are administered by local authorities.

[ VAT refunds are available on the cost of aids and appliances ](/en/money-
and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/vat-refunds-
on-aids-and-appliances-used-by-people-with-disabilities/) used by people with
disabilities, as well as on the cost of installation and adaptation work.
