##  Getting the work done

The grant will not be paid if you start work before you get grant approval.
However, it is expected that the work will start within 6 months of your grant
approval. If this does not happen, the local authority may allow a time
extension. The grant is paid when the work is completed.

The proposed works should include the installation of smoke and carbon
monoxide alarms, if you don't already have them in your home.
