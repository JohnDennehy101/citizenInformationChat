###  Meals services

If you need help preparing meals, the meals services are provided by voluntary
and statutory bodies and are sometimes called 'meals-on-wheels'. Access to
meals services is generally by referral. You may be asked to contribute
towards the cost of meals services. Eligibility conditions vary from area to
area.
