##  How MABS can help you

MABS provides a confidential service and will not discuss your situation with
anyone without your signed agreement. MABS will give you information and
support you in making decisions, but will not tell you what to do about your
debts and payments. You are the person who decides.

If you  contact the MABS Helpline  an adviser will talk to you about your
money concerns and give you some advice. They can send you information and
materials to help you with your money problems. You may be able to deal with
the issues yourself at this stage, or you can make an appointment to see a
money adviser in a MABS office.

When you contact MABS, it is important to tell them about anything very
urgent, for example, if you are being taken to court or your electricity is to
be disconnected. In cases like these, you may be able to get an emergency
appointment.

To be able to help you, the MABS adviser will need as much information as
possible about your financial situation. You will need to collect any bills,
statements, account books, payslips, or social welfare receipts that you have,
as well as any letters that your creditors have sent, even if you have not
opened them.

The adviser will:

  * Look at all your income and ensure that you are getting any payments or benefits you are entitled to 
  * Check through all your debts 
  * Help you to work out how much you need to cover your everyday needs 
  * Give you advice on budgeting 
  * Draw up a financial statement to use when dealing with your creditors 
  * Help you to decide which of your debts to pay first 
  * Help you to work out a payment plan â€“ how much you can afford to pay each week off each debt 
  * Negotiate with your creditors on your behalf, if you want 
  * Provide support while you deal with your debts 
  * Refer you to other services and contact them on your behalf, if you want 
  * Help to arrange to pay regular amount off your debts, as agreed with your creditors 
  * Refer you to someone who can help with a [ personal insolvency option ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-insolvency-options/) if appropriate
