###  MABS agreement with lenders

MABS has an agreement with the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland
(BPFI) to help people to manage their debt repayments. The lenders involved
have agreed to work with MABS to help customers find a solution and agree a
manageable repayment plan.

The agreement is called the [ BPFI-MABS Operational Protocol (pdf)
](https://www.mabs.ie/59/BPFI_MABS_Operational_Protocol_2015.pdf) . It sets
out the process followed by lenders and MABS when you seek help from MABS.

The protocol allows for the write-off of some debt, at the lenderâ€™s
discretion. It does not apply to mortgage debt.

MABS can also help you to agree a sustainable repayment plan with other
creditors (who are not part of the protocol.
