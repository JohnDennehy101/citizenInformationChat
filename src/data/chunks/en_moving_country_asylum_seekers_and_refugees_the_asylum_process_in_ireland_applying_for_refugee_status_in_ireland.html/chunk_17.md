##  Step 6: Get a decision from the Ministerial Decisions Unit

The IPO’s recommendation is sent to the Ministerial Decisions Unit (MDU) of
the Department of Justice.

If the IPO has recommended that you should get a refugee or subsidiary
protection declaration, you will have to wait until the MDU decides on this.
Usually, the MDU follows the IPO’s recommendation, but sometimes the MDU also
does some checks and the decision could be delayed.

If the IPO did not recommend that you get a refugee or subsidiary protection
declaration **and** you did not appeal (or your appeal was unsuccessful), the
MDU will decide if there are other reasons for granting you leave to remain in
Ireland. You can read about what happens [ if your application for
international protection is unsuccessful. ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-
and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/if-your-application-for-refugee-
status-is-refused/)

If the MDU tells you that you have been declared a refugee, or given
subsidiary protection, or you have been given ‘leave to remain’, you must [
register with your local immigration office ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-
ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-
ireland/) .
