###  The personal interview

The interview is your chance to tell the IPO about why you left your country,
the things you have experienced or seen and why you are afraid to return.

The case worker will write down the information you give at this interview.
Itâ€™s important that you to make sure they read it back to you so you can check
that it is accurate. You can ask for the document to be corrected if you think
you have been misunderstood, or you wish to give more details about something.

You might have to talk about things that have happened to you or your family
that are upsetting for you to talk about. If you have a solicitor with you,
they cannot answer questions on your behalf.
