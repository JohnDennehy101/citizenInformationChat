##  Step 1: Tell the authorities you want to apply

You can apply at the port of entry to Ireland (an airport or ferry port) or
later at the [ International Protection Office (IPO) in Dublin
](http://www.ipo.gov.ie/) .

Families with a child under 18 years of age, where the family is making an
application on the same day, should go to the IPO office at the Citywest
Convention Centre, Dublin 24 â€“ see 'Further information and contacts' below.

All other applicants should attend the IPO office in Lower Mount Street,
Dublin 2 -see 'Further information and contacts' below.

If you apply at the port of entry, you will still have to make a formal
application at the IPO office. Make sure you do this within 5 working days
(not Saturdays or Sundays) of your arrival in Ireland.
