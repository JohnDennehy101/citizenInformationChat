##  Who can apply for international protection?

You can apply for international protection in Ireland for two separate
reasons:

  * You have a ‘well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion’, and you cannot seek the protection of your country. This is called [ refugee status ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-introduction#lad40a) . 
  * You cannot return to your own country because you are at risk of serious harm, but you do not qualify as a refugee. This is called [ subsidiary protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-introduction#l50016) status. 

If you are seeking international protection, your application must be
assessed, and you must be allowed to stay in Ireland while the [ IPO assesses
your application ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-
process-in-ireland/how-refugee-applications-commissioner-deals-with-
applications/) .

If you have children with you, they are included in your application.
