###  Waiting times for interviews

You may have to wait some time before you are called for your personal
interview. In some cases, your application can be prioritised, which means
that you do not have to wait as long for your interview. Your case can be
prioritised if:

  * You are under 18, or were under 18 when you applied, and you are not accompanied by an adult. 
  * You are over 70 and not part of a family group. 
  * You have sent in a report, called a _medico-legal report_ , that confirms that you were tortured or ill-treatment in your country. Your legal aid solicitor can arrange for you to see a doctor to get a medical report if you need one. 
  * You are from Syria, Eritrea, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, Libya or Syria. 
  * You have a severe or life-threatening health condition. 
  * You are from a [ safe country of origin ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/international-protection-terms/) or [ a country subject to an accelerated process ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/28861-minister-mcentee-announces-further-measure-to-expedite-international-protection-application-processing/) . 

You will be given the date, time and place of your interview.
