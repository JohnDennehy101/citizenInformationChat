##  Conditions necessary for getting a dissolution

Before a court can grant a dissolution, the following conditions must be met:

  * You must have been living apart from one another for a period amounting to 2 out of the previous 3 years before the application is made 
  * Proper arrangements must have been made or will be made for each other and any dependent child or children 

**Living apart**

The [ Family Law Act 2019 (pdf)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/act/37/enacted/en/pdf) provides a
definition of ‘living apart’ to give certainty to the interpretation of the
term in the Irish courts. It clarifies that civil partners who live in the
same home as one another are considered to be living apart if the civil
partners are not living together as a couple in an intimate and committed
relationship. The Act also sets out that a relationship does not cease to be
an intimate relationship merely because the relationship is no longer sexual
in nature.

If these conditions are met, either of you may apply to court for a decree of
dissolution.
