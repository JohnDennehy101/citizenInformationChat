###  Marriage Act 2015

Following the commencement of the Marriage Act 2015 on 16 November 2015, you
can no longer register a civil partnership in Ireland. Civil partnerships
registered abroad since 16 May 2016 are not recognised in Ireland.

Couples already in a civil partnership can apply to marry or remain as they
are. If you decide to marry, your civil partnership is automatically
dissolved.
