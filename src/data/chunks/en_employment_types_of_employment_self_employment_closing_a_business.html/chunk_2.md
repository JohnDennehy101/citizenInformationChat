##  Introduction

When you decide to sell or close your business, there are several important
considerations you need to make.

These include finalising tax issues with Revenue, meeting your
responsibilities to your employees and suppliers and informing the Companies
Registration Office.

By understanding and fulfilling your legal obligations, you can ensure a fair
and legal process when closing your business.

This page gives a summary of information on these issues. It covers both
stopping self-employment and closing or selling a company. We have provided
links to more detailed information to help guide you through the process.
