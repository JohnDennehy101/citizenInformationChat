####  **When is a receiver appointed?**

A receiver may be appointed either by the court or by a lender when enforcing
a loan agreement.

The role of the receiver is to take control of the company's assets that were
used as security for the loan, such as a mortgage on property. The receiver is
responsible for selling these assets on behalf of the lender.

**When is an examiner appointed?**

If a company's financial health is deteriorating but it still holds potential
to be viable, the court can appoint an examiner. The examiner assesses the
company's situation and develops a rescue plan that aims to save the company.
