##  Closing a company

There are different things to consider if you want to sell or close a limited
company. Usually, you need the agreement of the company’s directors and
shareholders.

The way you close the company depends if it’s a voluntary liquidation or and
involuntary liquidation.

A **voluntary liquidation** usually doesn’t involve the courts. Members or
creditors (or both) are more involved in winding up of the company.

An **involuntary liquidation** supervised by the High Court. The court chooses
a liquidator to act on its behalf.

**Voluntary liquidation (windup)**

If your business is a company, you may want to close because of retirement or
another personal reason.

**Liquidation** is the process of closing a company so that it no longer
exists. The company’s assets are used to pay its debts. A liquidator is
appointed to close the company.

**What does a liquidator do?**

When a company is in liquidation, the liquidator usually takes over the
directors’ powers. The liquidators main role is to:

  * Sell the company’s assets 
  * Pay off its debts 
  * Distribute any remaining funds to the company’s members 

There are 2 types of voluntary liquidation:

**Situation** |  **Type of liquidation** |  **How it works**  
---|---|---  
The company is able to pay its debts (solvent)  |  Members’ voluntary liquidation  |  A member is someone who has invested in the company, is officially registered as a member, and has certain rights.  To start the process, a majority of the company's directors must make a [ declaration of solvency ](https://www.cro.ie/Termination-Restoration/Company/Winding-Up/Declaration-Form) . This means that they have thoroughly examined the company's affairs and believe that it will be able to pay off its debts within a specific timeframe.  Once the declaration of solvency is made, a liquidator is appointed by the members and oversees the process of selling assets, settling debts and distributing any surplus funds.   
The company is unable to pay its debts (insolvent)  |  Creditors’ voluntary liquidation  |  The members of the company decide to initiate a creditors' voluntary liquidation.  The directors must arrange a meeting of the company's creditors. You must give at least 10 days' notice to all creditors, informing them of the meeting. During the meeting, the creditors will have the opportunity to appoint a liquidator, who will oversee the liquidation process.  The liquidator will sell the company's assets and use the proceeds to pay off its debts to the creditors, in line with relevant legislation.
