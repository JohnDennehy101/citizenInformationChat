##  Consumer law covering unfair terms

The law on unfair terms is set out in the [ EU Directive on unfair terms in
consumer contracts (93/13/EEC) ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?qid=1429176294813&uri=CELEX:31993L0013) . In Ireland, the
European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations (as
amended) put the EU Directive into national law.

The aim of the law on unfair contract terms is to protect you against the
abuse of power by the seller or supplier. It protects against one-sided
standard contracts and the unfair exclusion of essential rights in contracts.
