####  The grey list

This list does not include every unfair term and in some cases, a term that is
included on the list may be fair. Equally, a term which is not on the list,
may be found to be unfair if it puts you at a disadvantage.

The ‘grey list’ includes terms that:

  * Exclude or limit the seller’s liability if you die or are injured because of an act or omission by the seller 
  * Impose unequal obligations, for example, you are bound to the contract but the seller is allowed to get out of providing a service 
  * Exclude or limit your right to compensation if the seller does not deliver 
  * Allow the seller to keep pre-payments (for example, deposits) if you cancel but does not provide for you to be compensated if the seller cancels 
  * Give the seller the right to _unilaterally_ change (without your agreement) the terms of the contract without a valid reason 
  * Make you pay a fee to exercise your legal rights 
  * Prevent you from getting spare parts or repairs from another seller 
  * Require you to pay excessive advance payments 
  * Allow the seller to keep any payment for goods or services to be provided by a third party
