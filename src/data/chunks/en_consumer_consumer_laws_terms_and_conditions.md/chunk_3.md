##  Understanding terms and conditions

The terms and conditions set out what you agree to do (for example, pay a
certain price) and what you expect the seller to do in return.

Terms and conditions must be written in plain and understandable language. Any
_ambiguities_ (where there could be more than one meaning) in a contract term
will be interpreted in your favour. The rules are only for contracts between a
consumer and a trader (known as B2C transactions).

There are different types of terms explained below.

  * **Express terms:** terms, or direct promises, that are individually agreed between you and the trader (for example, agreeing a price for a good or service if it is not fixed). 
  * **Standard terms or ‘small print’:** terms that are already included and you have had no influence over them. 
  * **Core terms:** terms that set out the main conditions of the contract or the basic nature of the goods or services (for example, the price). 
  * **Mandatory terms:** terms that are required by law or industry regulations. 
  * **Implied terms:** these terms are not mentioned but are automatically part of the contract because of [ consumer law ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-rights/) . Products, services and digital content or services must meet certain conditions of quality, performance and durability.
