##  What is a consumer contract?

A contract is an agreement between two or more people that is enforceable by
law. When you buy products or pay for a service, you enter into a consumer
contract with the seller or supplier. Both you and the seller are bound by the
terms and conditions of the contract.

Contracts can be made verbally or in writing. Sellers and suppliers are free
to set contractual terms, but these terms cannot be unfair or take away your
legal rights as a consumer. Contract terms are unfair if they put you at an
unfair disadvantage.
