##  Who decides if a term is unfair?

Only the courts can decide whether a term is unfair or not. If you think a
term is unfair, and you have been unable to fix the issue with the seller, you
can take legal action.

You may be able to use the [ small claims procedure ](/en/justice/courts-
system/small-claims-court/) or [ take a civil case ](/en/justice/civil-
law/taking-and-appealing-a-civil-case/) . If the trader is based in another EU
country, you can use the [ European small claims procedure
](/en/justice/courts-system/european-small-claims-procedure/) .

Consumer law also allows authorised bodies to bring court action in the
Circuit or High Court against traders who do not comply with the law – see
‘Reporting unfair contract terms’ below.

If the court decides that a contract term is unfair, you will no longer be
bound by the term. However, if the unfair term is not an essential element of
the contract, the rest of the contract (without the unfair term) will still be
legally binding on you and the seller.
