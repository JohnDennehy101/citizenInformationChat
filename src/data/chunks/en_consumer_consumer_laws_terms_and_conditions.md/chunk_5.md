###  The fairness and transparency tests

The fairness test is the legal test for assessing the fairness of terms. When
assessing the fairness of a contract term, the following factors are
considered:

  * The strength of the bargaining position of the parties 
  * Whether the consumer was offered an inducement to agree to the term (an _inducement_ could be a payment or a discount) 
  * Whether you customised your order and the products or services were sold or supplied based on what you asked for 
  * Whether the seller or supplier has dealt with you fairly and equitably 

The term must also be transparent and presented to you in a way you can
understand. A term is transparent if it:

  * Is written in plain and understandable language 
  * Is clearly presented 
  * Brings new or complex terms to your attention 
  * Clearly explains the cost of the term 

It is up to the seller to prove a term is transparent.
