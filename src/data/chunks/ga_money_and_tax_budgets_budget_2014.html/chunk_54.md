####  Other provisions

€10 million is to be saved by the removal of products from the List of
Reimbursable Items for the medical card and Drugs Payment Scheme. The HSE will
now consider products for review in compliance with the provisions of the
Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.

The Health (Amendment) Act 2013 introduced a new system of charges for private
in-patients using public hospital facilities. This will take effect from 1
January 2014.

€20 million is allocated in 2014 for the development of mental health services
in line with the strategy document "A Vision for Change".
