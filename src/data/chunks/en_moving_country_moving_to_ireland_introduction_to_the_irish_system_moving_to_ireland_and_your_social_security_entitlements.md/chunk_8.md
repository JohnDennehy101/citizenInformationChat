###  Transferring UK benefits

Many UK benefits, including national insurance pensions, can continue to be
paid to you by the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) if you move from
the UK to Ireland. You should always ask, before you move, if you can transfer
your existing UK benefits outside the UK. Contact the [ DWP's International
Pension Centre ](https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre) for more
information.
