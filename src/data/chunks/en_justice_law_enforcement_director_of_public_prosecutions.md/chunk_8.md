###  After the trial

When a court has found the accused guilty, it will decide on the [ sentence
](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/sentence/) .

If the DPP considers the court sentence to be too lenient, it may appeal the
sentence to the Court of Appeal. The DPP cannot appeal against a sentence
given in the District Court.
