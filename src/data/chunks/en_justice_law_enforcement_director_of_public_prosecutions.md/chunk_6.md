###  Will I be told if the DPP decides to prosecute?

If you are the victim in the case, the Gardai will tell you if the DPP decides
to prosecute and will keep you informed of developments. You will be told the
time, date and place of the court hearing.

If the case relates to a sexual offence or a violent crime, the DPP will offer
you a pre-trial meeting with the investigating Garda, the solicitor, and the
barrister dealing with the case. You will be told about the trial process, but
you will not be able to discuss witness evidence.

If the case relates to another type of offence, you can request a pre-trial
meeting.
