##  If the DPP decides to prosecute

If the DPP decides to prosecute, the Gardaí charge the suspect in the case and
bring them before the District Court. The suspect is known as ‘the accused’ or
‘the defendant’ from this point on.

The Gardaí then compile a book of evidence against the accused. The book of
evidence includes:

  * Statements from the victim and other witnesses 
  * A list of physical evidence that will appear in court, like photographs or weapons 
  * Evidence the prosecution thinks witnesses will give in court 
  * Other relevant documents 

Once the prosecution has gathered all the evidence needed for the trial, it
will give the book of evidence to the accused and the District Court will set
a date for the trial.
