###  Who decides whether to prosecute or not?

The DPP decides whether to prosecute in serious criminal cases, such as
murder, manslaughter, sexual offences, or fatal road incidents.

The Gardaí may prosecute less serious crimes, but they still prosecute in the
name of the DPP who has the right to tell the Gardaí how to deal with the
case.
