####  Back to Work Family Dividend

A new Back to Work Family Dividend will be introduced for lone parent and
long-term jobseeker families with children who find or return to work from
January 2015.

This will also apply to lone parent and long-term jobseeker families with
children who start or return to self-employment.

The Qualified Child Increase of €29.80 per week will be paid in full for the
first year in employment and half that amount will be paid weekly for the
second year. This amounts to €1,550 per child in Year 1 and €775 in Year 2\.

The Back to Work Family Dividend will be paid in addition to any entitlement
the family may have under the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme and will
not affect the level of the FIS payment.
