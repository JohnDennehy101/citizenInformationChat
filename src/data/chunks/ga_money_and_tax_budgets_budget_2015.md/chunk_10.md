###  Corporation Tax

The 25% **R &D tax credit ** applies to the amount of qualifying R&D
expenditure incurred by a company in a given year that is in excess of the
amount spent in 2003. This 2003 base year restriction is now being removed
from 1 January 2015.

The current restrictions on **capital allowances for the provision of
specified intangible assets** will be removed.

The **accelerated capital allowances for energy efficient equipment** were due
to expire at the end of 2014. Following a review by the Department of
Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, this measure is being extended
to the end of 2017.
