###  Payments to families and children

An extra €2 million will be provided for the Department of Social Protection’s
School Meals Programme in 2015. This funding will be used to increase funding
to existing DEIS schools. Over €349 million will be provided for Family Income
Supplement (FIS) in 2015.

The rate of **Child Benefit** will increase by €5 to €135 per month for each
child from January 2015. It is proposed that it will increase by a further €5
in 2016. This will cost €1.97 billion in 2015 and will benefit 613,000
families.
