###  Water supports

A **Water Support payment** of €100 annually (€25 per quarter) will be paid to
pensioners, people with disabilities and carers who qualify for a Household
Benefits Package. This measure will cost €42 million and will benefit 415,000
households in 2015.

An additional €100 per annum will be paid to all **Fuel Allowance recipients**
who do not already get the Household Benefits Package. Fuel Allowance is paid
to people getting long-term payments such as Jobseeker’s Allowance (over 15
months) and One-Parent Family Payment. This will cost €24 million and will
benefit 238,000 households in 2015.
