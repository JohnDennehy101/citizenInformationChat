####  Student Grant

Under the Student Grant Scheme, students will get 4 months of maintenance
payments before the end of December and 5 months of payments in the following
year (from the 2015â€“2016 academic year). Currently, 3 months of payments are
made before the end of December and 6 months of payments are made the
following year. This measure is to reduce financial difficulties experienced
by students due to the fact that the academic year now starts earlier in many
higher education institutions.
