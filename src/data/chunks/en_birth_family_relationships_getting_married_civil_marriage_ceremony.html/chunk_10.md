###  Language interpretive services

If you, your intended spouse, or either of the 2 witnesses do not speak
English and cannot understand the ceremony, then you will need the services of
an interpreter. It is your responsibility to provide the interpreter services.
Interpreters must be from an independent verifiable translation or
interpretation service.
