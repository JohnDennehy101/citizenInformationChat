##  Getting married by civil ceremony

You and your partner must take certain steps before you can get married by
civil ceremony:

  1. Decide on a venue â€“ there are rules about where a civil ceremony can take place (see below) 
  2. Tell the registrar about your intention to get married (also called _giving notice_ and _notification of intention to get married_ ) 
  3. Get a Marriage Registration Form (MRF) from the registrar, which must be signed immediately after the marriage ceremony by you, your partner, the registrar, and 2 witnesses 
  4. The registrar will then use the MRF to legally register your marriage in Ireland. After this, you can get your marriage certificate.
