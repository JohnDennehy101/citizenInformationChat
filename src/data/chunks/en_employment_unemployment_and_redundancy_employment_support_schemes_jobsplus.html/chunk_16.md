###  Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplement

You cannot get Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplement if you (the jobseeker) or
your spouse are in full-time employment (30 hours or more a week).

If you are already getting [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) , you may be able to
keep it, if you satisfy a [ means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) , while you
are working full time, as long as you are eligible for housing support under
the [ Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-
social-housing/rental-accommodation-scheme/) .
