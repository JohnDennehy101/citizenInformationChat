##  What is JobsPlus?

[ JobsPlus ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/eecbb7-jobsplus/) is a financial
incentive to encourage employers to hire people who are unemployed. Employers
use JobsPlus when filling new positions, or re-filling positions that occur
from staff turnover.

Eligible employers, who employ [ jobseekers from the live register
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/signing-on/) on a full-time basis, get
regular grant payments to help balance wage costs.

This is paid monthly, in arrears, over a 2-year period by the Department of
Social Protection (DSP). If the employee is under 30 years of age, the payment
is co-funded by the European Commission.
