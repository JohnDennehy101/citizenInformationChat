###  Do these notification requirements apply to someone convicted outside the
State?

Yes. If you are convicted of a sexual offence outside Ireland and that offence
is a sexual offence in Ireland, you are subject to the same Garda notification
requirements if you come to live in Ireland. If you fail to notify the Gardaí
of your details, the Gardaí can prosecute you for non-compliance with the
requirements.
