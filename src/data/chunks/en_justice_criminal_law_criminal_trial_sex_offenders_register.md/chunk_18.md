###  Cancelling or varying a sex offender order

Under the Sex Offenders Act 2001 if you have a sex offender order you can
apply to court to change the order, or have it cancelled.

The Court can vary or cancel the order if it is satisfied that the order is no
longer required to protect the public from serious harm or is causing an
injustice by being in effect.

For example, the court might vary an order that prevents a sex offender from
approaching school grounds if the sex offender applies for permission to
attend their child’s parent/teacher meeting at their school. In this instance,
the court may look favourably on varying the order for the day of the meeting.

Similarly, a court may cancel a sex offender order if a psychologist who
counselled the offender gives evidence that the offender no longer poses a
danger to society.

Applications to vary or cancel a sex offender order are made to the Circuit
Court in the area where the offender lives or to the [ Circuit Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) in the area where the offender’s
behaviour led to the sex offender order.

Sex offenders who are involved in sex offender order proceedings are entitled
to [ free legal aid ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/legal-aid-
and-advice/civil-legal-advice-and-legal-aid/) provided they meet the relevant
criteria.
