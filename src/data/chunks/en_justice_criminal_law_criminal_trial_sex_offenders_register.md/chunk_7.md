###  Can an offender apply to have the obligation cancelled?

Any sex offender required to report to the Garda√≠ indefinitely can apply to
the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) to cancel
their obligation. However, such an application will only be considered a
minimum of 10 years following your release from custody.

You apply to cancel your reporting requirement on the grounds that it no
longer serves the common good. You must provide your local Garda
Superintendent with advance notice of your intention to apply for the
cancellation of your requirement.
