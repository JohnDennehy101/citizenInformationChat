###  Can I find out if a sex offender lives in my area?

No. The details held by the Gardaí about people guilty of sex offences are not
subject to [ freedom of information
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/national-
government/standards-and-accountability/freedom-of-information/) legislation.
Therefore, you cannot use the Freedom of Information Acts to find out about
sex offenders living in your area.

[ Data protection rights
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/national_government/standards_and_accountability/data_protection.en.html)
only allow you to request information that is held about yourself. This
includes information held by the Gardaí (with a number of exceptions). It is
not possible to make a data protection request about another person.

**Garda powers to disclose information about offenders**

Gardaí can disclose some information about an offender on the sex offenders
register if they believe there is a serious risk to the public and it is
necessary. The Gardaí can disclose this information to anybody they feel must
know to prevent harm.

Information the Gardaí can disclose includes:

  * The offender’s name, photograph and current address 
  * The nature of the offence they were convicted for 
  * The risk the offender poses to the public 
  * Any other information the Gardaí believe the public needs to know 

If the Gardaí intend to disclose your information, they must tell you before
the disclosure and the reasons for it. They must give you an opportunity to
make a written submission outlining whether you think the disclosure should be
made.

The Gardaí do not need to notify you if they have been unable to locate you
after making reasonable efforts to do so, or if they feel that the disclosure
should be made immediately to prevent harm to the public.

If you breach your notification requirements and your whereabouts are unknown,
the Gardaí can publish your details for the purposes of finding you.
