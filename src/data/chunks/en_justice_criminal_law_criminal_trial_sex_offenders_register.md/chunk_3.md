##  Sex offenders register

If you are convicted of a sex offence, the court will issue you with a
Certificate of Conviction setting out the length of your sentence and your
reporting requirements.

The court will also give a copy of your certificate to the [ Sex Offender
Management and Intelligence Unit (SOMIU) ](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-
us/organised-serious-crime/garda-national-protective-services-bureau-
gnpsb-/sex-offender-management-and-intelligence-unit-somiu-/) , the Garda
department responsible for maintaining a record of people [ subject to Part 2
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2001/act/18/enacted/en/print#part2) of
the Sex Offenders Act. This record is commonly referred to as the ‘sex
offenders register’, although the term has no formal legal basis.

The sexual offences subject to reporting requirements include:

  * Rape 
  * Sexual assault 
  * Aggravated sexual assault 
  * Incest 
  * Defilement of a child aged under 15 (defilement means engaging in a sexual act with a child) 
  * Defilement of a child aged between 15 and 17 
  * Other sexual activities involving children or vulnerable people 
  * Attempts or assistance in relation to any of the above 

In the cases of sexual assault and incest, the reporting requirements in the
Sex Offenders Act 2001 do not apply if:

  * The victim or other party to the offence was aged 17 years or more when the offence was committed, and 
  * The person convicted has not been sentenced to any punishment involving imprisonment or made subject to any measures involving deprivation of liberty 

The reporting requirements do not apply in cases of defilement of a child aged
under 17 years if:

  * The victim is aged between 15 and 17 years of age when the offence takes place, and 
  * The person guilty of the offence is less than 3 years older than the victim
