###  What information must the sex offender provide?

If you are convicted of a sexual offence and become subject to the reporting
requirements of the Sex Offenders Act 2001, you must notify the Gardaí of:

  * Your name, date of birth and home address within 3 days of becoming subject to the requirements (this normally means within 3 days of being released from prison) 
  * Any change to your name or home address within 3 days of the change 
  * Any plans to live somewhere else in Ireland or to leave Ireland for more than 3 days (if you plan to do this, you must provide the Gardaí with the address you will be staying at) 

If someone is subject to sex offender notification requirements and is in
prison for any offence, the prison must notify the Garda Commissioner at least
10 days before the prisoner is due to be released.

Even if your circumstances do not change, you must inform Gardaí of your
living arrangements once every 12 months.

**Fingerprints, palm-prints and photographs**

If you are subject to the sex offender notification requirements, Gardaí can
take your fingerprints, palmprints and photograph to confirm your identity.
