###  How long does the requirement to notify the Gardaí last?

You are obliged to provide this information to the Gardaí about yourself:

  * Indefinitely if you were sentenced to life in prison or to a term of more than 2 years 
  * For 10 years if the prison sentence was for between 6 months and 2 years 
  * For 7 years if the sentence was for less than 6 months 
  * For 5 years if the sentence imposed was suspended or if no prison sentence was imposed 

If you were under 18 when the offence was committed, the court sets out how
long you must provide this notification for. The maximum period the court can
set is 5 years.

If you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment and part of that term is
suspended, the suspended part is not included when calculating the term of
imprisonment for the purpose of the length of the notification requirements.
