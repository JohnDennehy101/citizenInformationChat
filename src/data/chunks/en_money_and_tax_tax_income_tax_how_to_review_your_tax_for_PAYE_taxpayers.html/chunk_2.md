##  Introduction

You can check your income and the tax you paid in previous years and whether
you paid the correct amount.

You can check:

  * How much you were paid by your employer or pension provider and how much was deducted from your pay 
  * Whether you paid too much or too little income tax and USC 
  * Whether you are due a refund or whether you owe tax, taking into account all your income tax credits and liabilities 

In 2020, there was a change to the way you review your tax for a previous
year. Paper documents were replaced with an online system.

This page explains how you can:

  * Review your pay and deductions for a previous year, using the **Employment Detail Summary** (this replaced the paper form P60) 
  * View your tax for a previous year and check if you underpaid or overpaid tax, using the **Preliminary End of Year Statement**
  * Review your final tax liability for a previous tax year, using your **Statement of Liability (** this replaced the paper form P21) 

If your Preliminary End of Year Statement shows that you have paid too much
tax, you can claim a tax refund by [ making a tax return

.

If your Preliminary End of Year Statement shows that you have paid too little
tax, you can make a tax return to check how much you owe and whether there are
extra tax reliefs you can claim to reduce the amount of tax you have to pay.

You can get statements for the previous 4 years and you can make a tax return
for those years. For example, in 2024 you can claim a tax refund for the years
2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.
