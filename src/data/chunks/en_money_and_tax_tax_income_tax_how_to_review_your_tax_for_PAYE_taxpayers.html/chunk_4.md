##  How can I check if I am due a tax refund or if I owe tax?

Your Preliminary End of Year Statement shows whether you have paid the correct
amount of income tax and USC for the year. This is based on your income and
deductions as reported by your employer or pension provider.

To view your Preliminary End of Year Statement:

  1. [ Sign in to myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html)
  2. Go to the ‘PAYE Services’ section 
  3. Click ‘Review your tax 2020–2023’ 
  4. Select the specific year folder from the ‘Tax year’ dropdown list 
  5. Click 'Request' in the Statement of Liability section 
  6. Your Preliminary End of Year Statement will be shown on the next page. 

The statement for a year is usually available from mid-January of the
following year.

The Preliminary End of Year Statement may show that you have paid too much tax
or too little.

If it shows an overpayment, you can claim a refund by [ making a tax return
](https://revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/paye-income-tax-returns/index.aspx)
. Refunds are paid by cheque or by bank transfer if you provide your bank
account details.

The Preliminary End of Year Statement only takes into account the information
on Revenue’s records. If the statement shows an underpayment, you need to get
a final statement of income tax due taking into account any credits or reliefs
you may be entitled to. This is called a Statement of Liability.
