##  How can I check my tax deductions and my pay for the year?

To see what your employer or pension provider paid you and what they deducted
in tax, you can get an Employment Detail Summary through [ Revenue’s myAccount
service ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) .

Your Employment Detail Summary shows the pay, income tax, Pay Related Social
Insurance ( [ PRSI ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) ) and Universal Social Charge [ (USC)
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) deducted by your
employer and paid to Revenue over the year. It also records your [ Local
Property Tax (LPT) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-
property-tax/) deductions if you choose to have LPT deducted from your pay.
Before 2019, this information was provided on a form called a P60.

To view your Employment Detail Summary:

  1. [ Sign in to myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/sign_in.html)
  2. Go to the ‘PAYE Services’ section 
  3. Click on ‘Review your tax 2020–2023’ 
  4. Select the specific year folder from the ‘Tax year’ dropdown list 
  5. Click 'View' to view the Employment Detail Summary 

You can also save or print this document and use it in the same way as the
Form P60, for example, as proof of income. You can read more about the [
