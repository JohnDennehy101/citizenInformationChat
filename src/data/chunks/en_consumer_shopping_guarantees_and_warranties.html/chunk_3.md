##  What is a guarantee?

A guarantee is a written statement provided free of charge by the
manufacturer. It usually includes assurances about the quality of the item, or
service, as well as a promise to provide repair or replacement if something
goes wrong within a set amount of time (for example, within 12 months after
purchase). It is a legally binding document that can be enforceable through
the courts if necessary.

The guarantee should have the following information:

  * What goods the guarantee applies to 
  * The name and address of the person who will honour the guarantee (known as the _guarantor_ ) 
  * How long the guarantee is for 
  * How to make a claim under the guarantee 
  * What action the guarantor will take 
  * If you have to pay any charges for getting the product repaired (such as postage and packaging)
