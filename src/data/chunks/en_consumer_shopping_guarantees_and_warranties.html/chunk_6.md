##  How to use your guarantee orwarranty?

Remember, a guarantee or warranty is in addition to your statutory rights.
When there is a problem with the product or service you should always raise it
with the seller first. The seller is responsible for resolving the issue under
consumer law.

You are entitled to raise a problem about a product for up to 6 years from the
date of buying it. This applies regardless of the terms of any guarantee or
warranty.
