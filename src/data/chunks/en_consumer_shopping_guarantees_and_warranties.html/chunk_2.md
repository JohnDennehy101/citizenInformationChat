##  Introduction

If an item you have bought is faulty, you have the right to return the item to
the retailer and get a repair, replacement or refund. These rights are known
as your statutory rights. Find out more about [ your rights when goods are
faulty ](/en/consumer/shopping/problems-with-faulty-goods/) .

There are some products (for example, electrical, furniture or appliances)
that come with a commercial guarantee or warranty. The terms _guarantee_ and
_warranty_ can often be used interchangeably and it can sometimes be difficult
to know the difference between a guarantee and a warranty.

The main differences are:

  * **Guarantees** are usually free and offered by the manufacturer 
  * **Warranties** usually cost money and may be offered by the shop where you are buying the product 

Your **statutory rights** apply to products you buy. A warranty or guarantee
can give you extra protections but it does not replace [ your statutory
rights. ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-rights/)
