##  What is a warranty?

A warranty (or extended warranty) may be offered by a retailer at extra cost
and acts as sort of insurance policy. It covers the item or service after the
manufacturerâ€™s guarantee period. Benefits of having a warranty may include
paying some of the cost of a repair if the product breaks or becomes faulty.
Warranties may also offer extra cover for accidental damage.

A warranty is completely optional. You should carefully check what the
warranty covers and whether you really need to buy it.
