##  When does the school year start and end?

The dates for the start and the end of the school year are not the same for
all schools. Schools can decide when students start school in the autumn, and
when they finish school in the summer.

The school year normally starts in the week in which 1 September falls.

Post-primary schools usually close before the June public holiday (the first
Monday in June) due to the start of State exams in June. Primary schools
usually close in the last week of June.

All schools are closed for July and most (or all) of August.
