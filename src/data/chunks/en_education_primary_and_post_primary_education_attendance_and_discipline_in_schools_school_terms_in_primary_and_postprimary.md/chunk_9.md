###  Easter 2024

All schools close on Friday, 22 March 2024, which is the final day of the
school term, unless changes are needed to make up for time lost due to
unforeseen school closures. If a school needs to make up such time, it can
shorten the Easter break by staying open, up to and including Wednesday, 27
March 2024.

All schools re-open on Monday, 8 April 2024.
