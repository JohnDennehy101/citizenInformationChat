###  Discretionary days

Every school must be open for a minimum number of days:

  * Primary schools - 183 days 
  * Post-primary schools - 167 days 

Schools can use any remaining days at their discretion to extend the summer
holiday period or to close on religious or other holidays.

However, schools cannot use the discretionary days to extend the Christmas,
Easter or mid-term breaks (unless a religious observance day(s) falls at that
time for schools of a particular denomination or faith). If a school does not
have enough discretionary days left for a religious holiday, it can choose not
to have classes on that day.

Some schools use their discretionary days to extend bank holiday weekends and
others extend the May bank holiday break to a full week. You should check with
your school for details of the school holidays and any other planned
closures..
