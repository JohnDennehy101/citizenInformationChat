Every school year, primary and post-primary schools also close for:

  * Christmas 
  * February mid-term break 
  * Easter 

These holidays are standardised. The [ dates are set by the Department of
Education ](https://www.gov.ie/en/circular/0a2b0-standardisation-of-the-
school-year-in-respect-of-primary-post-primary-schools-for-the-
years-202324-202425-and-202526/) . See dates for the 'School year 2023-2024'

At the start of the school year, you will get a list of days that the school
will be closed during the year, including holidays and training days for
teachers. If there are other unexpected closures, the school will let you know
in advance.
