###  **There is no notice period in my contract**

_Statutory minimum notice_ is the shortest notice period that you can give
under Irish law. If your contract does not state a notice period, you must
provide the legal minimum, which is **one week** .

The full rules on giving notice are set out in the [ Minimum Notice and Terms
of Employment Acts 1973–2005
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1973/en/act/pub/0004/index.html) . The legal
(or ‘statutory’) minimum notice is set out in [ Section 6
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1973/act/4/section/6/enacted/en/html#sec6)
of the Act.
