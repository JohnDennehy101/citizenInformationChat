##  Can I leave before my notice period ends?

Usually, you are required to work the notice period.

Sometimes, your employer may agree that you can leave your job without working
until the end of your notice period. Your employer may offer you pay instead
of notice for that period.

Payment instead (or ‘in lieu’) of notice is covered in [ Section 7
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1973/act/4/section/7/enacted/en/html#sec7)
of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973.
