###  **Am I entitled to a reference by law?**

There is no legal requirement for your current or previous employer to give
you a reference. Few employment contracts include the right to have a
reference when you leave.

Employers usually provide references when asked. If they do this for some
employees, they should do it for all employees without discrimination.
