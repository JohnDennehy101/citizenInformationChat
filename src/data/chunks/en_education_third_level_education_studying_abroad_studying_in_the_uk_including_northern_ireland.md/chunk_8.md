###  Undergraduate courses  

**England, Wales and Northern Ireland:** Universities and colleges can charge
new students up to Â£9,250 sterling a year for undergraduate courses.

You can apply for a tuition fee loan which you only have to [ repay after you
have graduated ](https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/when-you-start-
repaying) . However, you are not entitled to maintenance support in the same
way as home students. If you are an Irish citizen who has been settled in the
UK for over 3 years you will be classed as a home student and will be able to
apply for financial support for living costs.

  
**Scotland:** Since 2021-2022, Irish students who start a full-time degree
course in Scotland must pay the same fee structure as an English student
studying in Scotland. You can apply for a tuition fee loan if you meet the [
relevant residence criteria ](https://www.saas.gov.uk/need-to-know/brexit) .

You may be eligible for a maintenance grant if you meet the criteria for the
Irish [ Student Grant Scheme ](/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-
supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/) but this does not
include funding for tuition fees. You may claim [ tax relief on third-level
fees ](/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-
education/tax-relief-for-third-level-fees/) . There is detailed information on
the range of Irish grants and funds for students in further and higher
education at [ studentfinance.ie ](https://hea.ie/funding-governance-
performance/funding/student-finance/) .

The [ GOV.UK website ](https://www.gov.uk/browse/education/student-finance)
has information on the [ financial supports available for Irish citizens
](https://www.ucas.com/finance/student-finance-england/finance-full-time-eu-
students) studying in the UK including Northern Ireland.
