###  Undergraduate course

[ UCAS (University and Colleges Admissions Service) ](http://www.ucas.com/) is
the central applications body for full-time undergraduate courses at UK
universities and colleges. Its website has all the information you need to
apply to college including: how to apply, fees and information about the
colleges. Applications must be made online through the UCAS website.

[ Use the UCAS tariff calculator ](https://www.ucas.com/ucas/tariff-
calculator) to calculate the tariff points required for entry to higher
education. It allows you to compare Leaving Certificate and GCSE A level
grades. A Leaving Certificate subject at honours level is approximately
equivalent to two-thirds of an A level.
