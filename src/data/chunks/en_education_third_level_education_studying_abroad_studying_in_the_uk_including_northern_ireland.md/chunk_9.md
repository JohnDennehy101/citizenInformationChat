###  Postgraduate courses

The tuition fees for postgraduate study vary from institution to institution
and course to course. Postgraduate prospectuses give up-to-date fees.

There are different sources of funding for postgraduate students. Some courses
include funding. Sometimes financial support is available from the university
that is running the postgraduate course; sometimes you need to apply to an
external body.

Awards are available for a range of subjects, both for taught courses and
research programmes. They vary as to amount, duration and whether they only
cover fees or include maintenance as well. There are strict eligibility rules
and deadlines for application and you should be aware that there are a large
number of postgraduates competing for limited funding.

Funding is available under the [ Student Grant Scheme ](/en/education/third-
level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-
scheme/) for postgraduate study in Northern Ireland but not for postgraduate
study in Britain. You may claim [ tax relief on third-level fees
](/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-
education/tax-relief-for-third-level-fees/) .

A number of scholarships and fellowships for study abroad are awarded annually
by foreign governments to Irish students who are engaged in or have completed
a course of third-level education. The [ North-South Masters Bursaries
](http://universitiesireland.ie/bursaries-scholarships/) fund a small number
of Irish students to study in Northern Ireland together with some Northern
Irish students studying in Ireland.
