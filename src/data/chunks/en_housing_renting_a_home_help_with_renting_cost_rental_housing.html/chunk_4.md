##  Do I qualify for cost rental housing?

Cost rental homes are aimed at people on middle incomes who may have
difficulty paying the rent in private rented accommodation, but who don’t meet
the income criteria for social housing support.

You qualify for cost rental housing if:

  * Your net household income is below €66,000 per annum for Dublin and €59,000 for everywhere else in the country 
  * You are not getting any social housing supports, including the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) 
  * You do not own a property 
  * Your household size matches the size of the property advertised. For example, a two-bed unit may be suitable for two adults, a couple, or lone parent with 1 or more children. 
  * You can afford to pay the rent for the home 
  * Your household has only applied once for a specific cost rental property 
  * All members of the household are living in Ireland when you apply 

Eligibility criteria for cost rental homes are set out in SI 755 of 2021.
