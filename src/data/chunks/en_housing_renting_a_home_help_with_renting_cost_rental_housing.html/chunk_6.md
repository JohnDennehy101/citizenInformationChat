##  How do I apply for a cost rental home?

When cost rental homes become available, they are advertised online by the
AHB, local authority or LDA, depending on who is administering the individual
scheme.

If you are interested in cost rental housing, you should check the LDA, AHB
and local authority websites for details about upcoming schemes. You can also
find [ a current list of scheme providers and available cost rental homes
](https://affordablehomes.ie/rent/available-properties/) on the [ Affordable
Homes website ](https://affordablehomes.ie/) .

You can apply for each cost rental home as it becomes available, there is no
central application system.

The landlord (AHB, local authority or LDA) decides on the application process
for each cost rental scheme. For example, an AHB may take applications online
on its website.

When you apply you will be asked to confirm your eligibility and will have to
submit these documents:

  * Proof of ID for everyone in the house, including children 
  * Proof of address 
  * Proof of residency 
  * Proof of income for everyone over 18 
  * Employer references for everyone over 18 
  * Bank statements for everyone over 18 
  * Landlord references for everyone over 18. (If you havenâ€™t rented before, you might need to provide additional information, such as a character reference and evidence of a track record of savings or contribution to household expenses.) 

You can find more information about what documents are accepted as proof on [
affordablehomes.ie ](https://affordablehomes.ie/rent/faq/) .

If there are more applications than homes available, there will be a lottery
for places. Every eligible application for each unit type will be entered into
a lottery and names will be chosen at random.
