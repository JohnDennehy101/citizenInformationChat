####  Assistance for parents of limited capacity

Parents whose children are the subject of child care proceedings may be
entitled to [ legal aid ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/legal-
aid-and-advice/civil-legal-advice-and-legal-aid/) . In certain circumstances,
where the parent’s ability to understand the child care proceedings is
significantly impaired due to an intellectual disability or a psychological
condition, the legal aid solicitor can apply for the appointment of another
person, sometimes known as a “support person” or “advocate”.

If appointed, they can:

  * Help the parent to understand and participate in the child care proceedings 
  * Attend consultations between the parent and the legal team and other relevant meetings 
  * Help the parent to understand the relevant documents and any legal advice provided 
  * Communicate the parent’s views to their legal team 

For further information on an advocate or support person, contact the [ Legal
Aid Board ](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/) or the [ National Advocacy
Service for People with Disabilities ](https://advocacy.ie/) .
