###  Supervision order

A supervision order allows Tusla to supervise a child's care without the child
being taken into the care of Tusla.

During the application for a care order, the court may decide that a care
order is not necessary or appropriate, but that the child should remain in
their home and be visited and monitored by Tusla. A supervision order may be
made instead of a care order, or while waiting for a decision on a care order.
Alternatively, Tusla may apply to the court for a supervision order instead of
a care order.

A supervision order gives Tusla the authority to visit and monitor the health
and welfare of the child and to give the parents support and advice. The order
is for a fixed period up to a maximum of 12 months but may be renewed.
