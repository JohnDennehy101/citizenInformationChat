##  Introduction

The decision to place a child or young person in care can be made in two
different ways:

  * On a voluntary basis with the agreement of the child or young personâ€™s parents/guardians 
  * By order of the courts such as care orders, emergency care orders or special care orders 

Children who require admission to care are typically placed:

  * In foster care 
  * With relatives 
  * In residential care 

The primary legislation regulating child care policy is the [ Child Care Act
1991 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1991/act/17/enacted/en/html) . The
definition of a child in legislation is a person under 18 years of age.
