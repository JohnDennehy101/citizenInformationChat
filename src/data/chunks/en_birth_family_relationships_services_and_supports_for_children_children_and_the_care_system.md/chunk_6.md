###  Emergency care order

Tusla can apply for an emergency care order for a child who is still at home
or for a child who has been removed by Garda√≠ if there is reason to believe
that there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of a
child. An emergency care order places a child in the care of Tusla for a
maximum of 8 days and it cannot be renewed. This order can be made without
notice being given to the parents or guardians of the child.
