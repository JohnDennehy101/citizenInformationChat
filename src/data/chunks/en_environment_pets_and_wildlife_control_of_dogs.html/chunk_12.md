###  My neighbour's dog won't stop barking. What can I do?

If your neighbour’s dog won’t stop barking, you should talk to your neighbour
first. If you can't resolve the issue with them, you can make a complaint to
the District Court and look for a hearing. When you get a court date, you must
notify the dog owner using a [ court form (docx)
](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/eb9b13cb-37ea-4fa3-82e3-9ca378b2c360/Order%20in%20relation%20to%20excessive%20barking%20by%20a%20dog%20-%20Control%20of%20Dogs%20Act%201986%20No.%2091.3.docx/docx/1)
, which is available from your local authority or the District Court.
