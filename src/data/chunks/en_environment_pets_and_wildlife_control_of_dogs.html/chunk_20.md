##  Rules about selling dogs in Ireland

There are rules about the sale and supply of pets, including dogs.

If you **sell or supply 5 or more pets in a calendar year** you must:

  * [ Register ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d3af4-new-rules-on-the-sale-supply-and-advertising-of-pet-animals/) with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine 
  * Keep records about pet animals for sale or supply 
  * Include certain information if you are advertising an animal for sale. For example, if you are advertising a dog for sale, you must include its microchip number. 
  * Not sell or supply pets under a certain age. This is 8 weeks for dogs. 

If you are advertising a dog for sale, the advertisement must have the dogâ€™s
microchip code.

These rules are set out in the [ Animal Health and Welfare (Sale or Supply of
Pet Regulations) 2019

There is a [ Code of Practice (pdf)
