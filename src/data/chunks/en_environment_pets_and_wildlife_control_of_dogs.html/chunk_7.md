###  Do I have to get a licence for my dog?

If your dog is over 4 months old, you must have a dog licence. Puppies under 4
months who are still with their mothers don't need a licence, but once they
leave their mothers, they must have a licence.

There are 3 types of dog licence:

  1. An individual dog licence, which costs €20 and is valid for 1 dog for 1 year 
  2. A 'lifetime of dog' licence, which costs €140 and is valid for your dog’s lifetime 
  3. A general dog licence, which costs €400 and is valid for 1 year. This covers multiple dogs at one location. 

You can apply for an individual or lifetime dog licence at your local [ post
office ](https://www.anpost.com/Government-Services/Dog-Licence) or online at
[ licences.ie ](https://www.licences.ie/ILAS/Home/Licences?bundleId=17) . A
general dog licence application must be sent to your [ local authority
](https://www.housingagency.ie/find-my-local-authority) .

Licences are **not** needed for:

  * Guide dogs for blind people 
  * Dogs that are being held by a local authority 
  * Dogs that are with the ISPCA or Gardaí 
  * Any dog imported into the State for less than 30 days
