###  Rules if you own a greyhound

Greyhounds are not a restricted breed. However, there are specific rules you
must follow if you are out with your greyhound in a public place. You must:

  * Always have your greyhound on a leash 
  * Never walk more than 4 greyhounds at a time 

These rules apply to greyhounds, whippets as well as strains or cross-breeds
of these breeds.
