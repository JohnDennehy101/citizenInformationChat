##  Getting legal advice

You are not legally required to use a [ solicitor
](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) or a [ barrister
](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) . In fact, if you wish, you can choose to
represent yourself. However, there may be complex issues which may make it
very difficult to apply for a judicial separation without any professional
help.

To enquire whether you are [ eligible for Legal Aid ](/en/justice/legal-aid-
and-advice/civil-legal-advice-and-legal-aid/) , you can [ contact your nearest
law centre
](http://www.legalaidboard.ie/lab/publishing.nsf/Content/Law_Centres) . Legal
Aid is not free and everyone must pay a contribution towards costs.

If you choose to hire a private solicitor, you should be aware that there is
no fixed rate of charges for legal fees. You are advised to get some quotes
before deciding on a legal firm. [ Contact information for solicitors firms
throughout Ireland ](https://www.lawsociety.ie/Find-a-Solicitor/Solicitor-
Firm-Search/) is available on the Law Society website.
