##  What is judicial separation?

When a couple cannot agree the terms by which they will live separately,
either person can apply to the courts for a 'decree of judicial separation'.
The decree confirms that the couple no longer have to live together as a
married couple. The court may also make orders in relation to custody and
access to children, the payment of maintenance and lump sums, the transfer of
property, the extinguishment of succession rights, etc.

Before the court grants you a decree of judicial separation, it must be
satisfied that:

  * The grounds for the application exist (see Grounds for judicial separation below) 
  * The couple has been advised about counselling and [ mediation ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/family-mediation-separating-couples/)
  * Proper provision has been made for the welfare of any _dependants_ (children) 

You can apply for a judicial separation in either in the [ Circuit Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) or the [ High Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) . As in all family law matters, cases
are heard in private (also known as 'in camera) and the public is not allowed
into the courtroom.

A couple must be living apart from one another for at least 1 year before
applying for a judicial separation – see ‘Living apart’ below. This is set out
in the [ Family Law Act 2019 (pdf)
](https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/act/2019/37/eng/enacted/a3719.pdf)
.

A decree of judicial separation does not give you the right to remarry. To
remarry, you must [ get a divorce ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-
and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) .
