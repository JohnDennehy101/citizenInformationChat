##  Grounds for judicial separation

You cannot apply for a judicial separation when you already have a [
separation agreement ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/separation-agreement/) in place which has been made an order of court.

An application for a judicial separation must be based on one of the following
6 grounds:

  * You or your spouse has committed adultery. 
  * One of you has behaved in such a way that it would be unreasonable to expect you both to continue to live together. 
  * One of you has deserted (left) the other for at least one year at the time of the application. 
  * You have lived apart from one another for at least one year at the time of the application for the decree (whether or not both parties agree to the decree being granted) - see ‘Living apart’ below. 
  * The court considers that a normal marital relationship has not existed between you for at least one year before the date of the application (this is the most common ground on which the decree is granted, as neither party has to be shown as being at fault). 

**Living apart**

The [ Family Law Act 2019
](https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/act/2019/37/eng/enacted/a3719.pdf)
provides a definition of ‘living apart’ to give certainty to the
interpretation of the term in the Irish courts. A married couple who live in
the same home as one another are considered to be ‘living apart’ if they are
not living together as a couple in an intimate and committed relationship. The
Act also states that a relationship does not stop being an intimate
relationship just because the relationship is no longer sexual in nature.
