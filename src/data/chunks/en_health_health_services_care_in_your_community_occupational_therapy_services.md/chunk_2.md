##  What is an occupational therapist?

If you have a disability, illness or are affected by aging, an occupational
therapist (OT) may be able to help you.

Occupational therapists work with you if you have difficulty with practical
everyday activities to help you become more independent in your day-to-day
life. For example, you may need an OT if you are diagnosed with a neurological
problem or a physical injury.

Occupational therapists can help people of all ages including elderly people,
adults, babies, children and young people. You can also read our page on [
