###  How do I get an occupational therapist?

First, an occupational therapist will assess your ability to do daily life
tasks, for example â€“ dressing, eating, bathing, etc.

They will also check your home to help them decide what assistance you need
from aids and appliances. For example, a wheelchair, chair lift or downstairs
bathroom.
