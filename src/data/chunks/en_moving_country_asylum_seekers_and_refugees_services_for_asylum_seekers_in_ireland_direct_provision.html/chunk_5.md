###  Accommodation and food

The place where you live in direct provision, called an accommodation centre,
is usually a hotel or hostel that is paid to provide accommodation to
international protection applicants. While you are in direct provision, you
get breakfast, lunch and an evening meal.

The [ International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/d9f43-international-protection-
accommodation-services-ipas/) is the state agency that looks after the direct
provision system.

Applicants for international protection who do not have children are not
prioritised for accommodation. You can read more about [ how international
protection applicants are prioritised for accommodation
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e202e-statistics-on-international-
protection-applicants-not-offered-accommodation/) . When you apply for
international protection, you will give your contact details. When
accommodation is available, IPAS will contact you.
