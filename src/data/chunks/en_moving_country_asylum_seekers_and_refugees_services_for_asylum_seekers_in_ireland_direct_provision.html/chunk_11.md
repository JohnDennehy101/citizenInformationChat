###  Can I work?

You are not allowed to work until you have been waiting for 6 months for the
IPO to issue its first decision (called the ‘first instance recommendation’)
on your application.

You can [ make an application for Labour Market Access Permission
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/labour-market-access-permission/) if:

  * You have been waiting for at least 5 months for a decision on your application and 
  * You have co-operated in the application process 

If you get permission to work, it is valid from when you have been waiting for
a decision on your IPO application for 6 months.

To apply for permission to work, you:

  * Fill in a [ Form LMA3 ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/LMA3-September-2022.pdf) (if you are not sure how to fill this in, you can visit your [ local Citizens Information Centre ](https://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) ) and send it to Immigration Services Delivery (see ‘Further information and contacts’ below) 

You can also apply for permission to be self-employed if you want to work for
yourself.

If your application is successful, Immigration Services Delivery will send you
a letter giving you permission to work.

When you find a job, your employer (or you if you are self-employed) should
send [ Form LMA5 ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2021/10/form-LMA5.pdf) to the Immigration Services Division.

You should apply to renew your permission to work one month before it expires
using [ Form LMA4 ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-
