##  Social insurance payments and benefits

A wide range of benefits are available to people who have paid social
insurance. Your entitlement to these benefits depends on a number of
conditions as well as the social insurance contribution requirement. The
social insurance qualifying criteria vary, depending on what payment you are
applying for. In general, when you apply for a social insurance payment the
following will be examined:

  * What class or classes of social insurance you have paid 
  * Your age when you started making social insurance contributions (this applies in the case of State pensions) 
  * The number of paid and/or [ credited contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) you have made since entering insurable employment 
  * The number of contributions paid and/or credited in the relevant tax year before the benefit year in which you make the claim. The relevant tax year is the second last complete tax year before you make a claim. 
  * The yearly average number of contributions in the case of some pensions
