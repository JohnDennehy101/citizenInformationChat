###  Moneylending agreements

An agreement with a licensed moneylender is called a high cost credit
agreement if any of the following apply:

  * The agreement or negotiations (or both) were made away from the business premises of the moneylender 
  * Under the agreement, you make your repayments at any place except the business premises of the moneylender 
  * The agreement has an [ APR (annual percentage rate) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/savings-and-investments/interest-on-loans-and-savings/) of 23% interest or higher 

A high cost credit agreement must:

  * Be in writing and include the names and addresses of you and the lender. 
  * Show the total amount loaned, the rate of interest and the total amount payable (the _cost of credit_ ). The lender cannot add any other charges, such as administrative costs. 
  * Tell you about your right to a 10-day ‘cooling-off’ period – the right to withdraw from the loan. If you give up this right, you must sign a separate part of the form stating this. 

You must get a repayment book, separate to the lending agreement. It may be on
paper or online. The repayment book:

  * States the total amount of the loan and the total number of repayments due 
  * Must note the amount and date of each repayment you make
