##  Repaying a high cost credit loan

Many moneylenders collect loan payments in cash each week. They cannot charge
you for home collection. Some moneylenders allow you to pay by direct debit.

Moneylenders must:

  * Give a written authorisation to any agent sent to your house to collect payment. This is usually an ID card. The agent is only allowed to collect repayments and cannot start or agree to new loans. 
  * Only call to your home from Monday to Saturday between 10am and 9pm. If you have agreed in writing beforehand, they may make the collection between 8am and 10am. 
  * Not contact you on Sundays or public holidays and they must not contact your employer or your family without your written permission. 

Under [ Section 11 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0026/sec0011.html#zza26y1997s11)
, it is an offence to demand payment of a debt in a way designed to alarm,
distress or humiliate. This includes blackmail and extortion. (Extortion means
using intimidation or the threat of violence to obtain money, information or
anything else of value from another person.) Read more about [ debt collection
