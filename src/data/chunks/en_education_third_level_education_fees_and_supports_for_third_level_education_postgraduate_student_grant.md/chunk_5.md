###  **How much** **maintenance grant will I get?**

The SUSI maintenance grant rate you get depends on:

  * Your assessed means (see ‘Means test and income limits for the postgraduate student grant’ below) 
  * The distance you normally live from the college (you get the ‘adjacent rate’ if you normally live 30 kilometres or less from your college, and the ‘non-adjacent’ rate if you live more than 30 kilometres away) 
  * If you’re a disadvantaged student (see ‘Special rate of grant’ below)
