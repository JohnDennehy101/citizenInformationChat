##  Means test and income limits for the postgraduate student grant

The means test for a student grant in 2024-2025 is based on your and your
family's gross income for the previous full tax year (2023). However, if you
or your family have had a [ change of circumstances
](https://www.susi.ie/applications-in-progress-next-steps/change-in-
circumstances/index.html) from 1 January 2024, your changed circumstances will
be taken into account. See [ what counts as a change in circumstances
](https://www.susi.ie/applications-in-progress-next-steps/change-in-
circumstances/index.html) on the SUSI website.

SUSI looks at all ’reckonable income’ when assessing your student grant
application. Reckonable income is gross income from all sources. Some social
welfare payments and financial support payments are excluded.

You can deduct up to €7,925 (previously €6,552) for your earnings outside of
term-time (known as ‘holiday earnings’).

Your [ applicant class ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-
criteria/income/applicant-class/) determines whose income is included in the
income calculation for grant assessment purposes. There are 3 types of
applicant class:

  * [ Dependent student ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/income/applicant-class/dependent-students/)
  * [ Mature dependent student ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/income/applicant-class/dependent-students/#d.en.11691:~:text=Will%20Appointed\)%20Guardians-,Mature%20Dependent%20Student,-If%20you%20were)
  * [ Independent student ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-criteria/income/applicant-class/independent-students/)
