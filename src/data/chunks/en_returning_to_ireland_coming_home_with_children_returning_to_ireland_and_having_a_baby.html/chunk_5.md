##  Can I get paid paternity leave from work?

New parents (not including the mother of the child) are entitled to 2 weeks’
paternity leave from employment or self-employment after the birth or the
adoption of a child.

You can start paternity leave at any time within the first 6 months of the
birth or adoption.

Paternity Benefit is paid at a standard weekly rate of €274 in 2024.

You can find out more about [ qualifying for Paternity Benefit and how to
apply ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-
and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/paternity-leave/) .

Your employer does not have to pay you when you are on paternity leave. Some
employers may offer paid paternity leave and you should check your employment
contract to see what applies to you. If your employer pays you while you are
on paternity leave, you may have to transfer the payment of your Paternity
Benefit to your employer.
