##  Can I access maternity care in the public health system?

If you are returning to Ireland to live and you plan to have a baby here, you
will be entitled to public health maternity care under the [ Maternity and
Infant Care Scheme ](/en/health/health-services/reproductive_health/maternity-
and-infant-welfare-services/) . This is because your entitlement to use public
health services is based on your residency. It is not linked to your income or
to your payment of tax or [ social insurance ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) .

The Maternity and Infant Care Scheme provides a care programme to all
expectant mothers who are _ordinarily resident_ in Ireland. You are [
ordinarily resident ](/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-public-health-
services/) if you have been living in Ireland for at least a year or if you
intend to live here for at least one year.

Under the Scheme, you are entitled to free GP visits and hospital visits
related to your pregnancy and the birth of your baby. This service is provided
by a family doctor (GP) of your choice and a hospital obstetrician. You are
entitled to this free service even if you do not have a [ medical card or a GP
visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/) .

Care for illnesses that are not related to your pregnancy are not covered by
the Scheme. This means that if you need to see your GP about a non-pregnancy
related illness (such as asthma), normal GP charges will apply (unless you
have a medical card or a GP visit card).
