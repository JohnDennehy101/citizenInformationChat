##  Can I get parental leave?

You are entitled to **unpaid** parental leave of 26 working weeks per child.
It must be taken before your child turns 12, or 16 if the child has a
disability.

Both parents have an equal and separate entitlement to parental leave for each
child.

Generally, you must have been working for your employer for one year before
you are entitled to parental leave â€“ although some employers offer the option
of parental leave immediately.

The legislation for parental leave provides for only the minimum entitlement.
Your contract of employment may give you more leave or other entitlements. You
