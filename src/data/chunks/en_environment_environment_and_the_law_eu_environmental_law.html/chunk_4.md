###  How do the EU enforce environmental legislation?

EU environmental legislation is enforced in the same way as other EU
legislation. The [ European Commission
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/eu-institutions/european-commission/) monitors that the legislation
is being put into practice and can bring individual member states to the [
European Court of Justice (ECJ)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/eu-institutions/european-court-of-justice/) if they do not apply it
properly.

[ Environmental crime ](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/legal/crime/index.htm)
s are acts that break environmental legislation and cause significant harm or
risk to the environment and human health. This includes:

  * Illegal emissions or discharges into air, water or soil 
  * Illegal trade in wildlife 
  * Illegal trade in ozone-depleting substances 
  * Illegal shipment or dumping of waste
