###  How do I use it?

You show your JAM Card to the person that you are interacting with (for
example, the bus driver). The card says ‘Just A Minute’ on one side, and you
can choose which message you would like on the other side of your card.

The message could say any of the following:

  * I have autism 
  * I am autistic 
  * I have a condition 
  * I have a learning difficulty or a disability 
  * I have an intellectual disability 

With the app, you can choose your own message.
