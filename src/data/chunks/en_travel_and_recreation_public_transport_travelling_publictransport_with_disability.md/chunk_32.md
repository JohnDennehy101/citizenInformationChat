###  If you have a hearing impairment

Each tram has electronic displays, so you can tell where you are on your
journey.

All trams are fitted with an induction loop for passengers using hearing aids
equipped with the T-switch. If you use a hearing aid, you can hear
announcements in the middle of the tram.
