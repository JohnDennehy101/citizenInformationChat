###  Wheelchair accessibility on the Luas

All Luas trams and stops are wheelchair-accessible. Each tram has a low floor
and level threshold with a minimal gap between the floor of the tram and the
edge of the platform.

If you are using a wheelchair, get on the Luas through the double doors in the
middle of each carriage as they are closest to the priority seating and
wheelchair area. Make sure that you are facing the rear of the tram while
travelling.

There are 2 designated spaces per tram, which can cater for up to 4 wheelchair
users. There are signs which say that these spaces are for wheelchair users.
There is also enough space in the entry and exit areas on the trams for
additional wheelchair users.
