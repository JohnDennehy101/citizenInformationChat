###  Wheelchair access on buses

**Dublin Bus**

On all Dublin bus buses, there is one space for a person using a wheelchair. A
wheelchair can be up to 70cm wide and 120cm long.

You should get on and get off the bus by the front doors, as the ramp is only
at the door near the driver. When you get on the bus, you can ask the driver
to give you extra time to get to your seat before the bus pulls away from the
stop.

To leave the bus, press the button with the wheelchair symbol on it, next to
the wheelchair space, shortly before your stop. This bell has its own sound
which lets the driver know that you wish to leave the bus.

You can find more information on wheelchair accessibility from [ Dublin Bus
