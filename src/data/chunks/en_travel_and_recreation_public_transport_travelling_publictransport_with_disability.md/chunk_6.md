###  What is the JAM Card and JAM App?

The [ JAM Card ](https://www.jamcard.org/) is a card or app that tells other
passengers that you need a little more time because you have a condition or a
disability. It can be a physical card or an app on your phone or both.

This card helps passengers with a communication barrier to say that they need
“just a minute” and to ask for patience. The JAM Card and App are free.
