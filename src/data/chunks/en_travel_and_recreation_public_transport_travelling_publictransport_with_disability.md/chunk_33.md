###  If you have a vision impairment

All trams are fitted with a bell which rings when the tram is approaching and
leaving a Luas platform.

There are automatic audio announcements on board with the names of each stop
together with other pre-recorded messages.

If in doubt while on board, speak with the driver to confirm your location.
You can use the emergency passenger communications device on the doorpost to
the right of the double doors to speak with the driver.
