###  Planning a journey

Before you start your journey, you can use [ Transport for Ireland’s (TFI)
online journey planner ](https://www.transportforireland.ie/plan-a-journey/)
to plan your journey.

The journey planner will give you information about bus and rail routes all
over Ireland. It will also tell you if a service is wheelchair accessible.

If you can’t travel alone, you may be able to get a free travel pass for your
travel companion. You can get more information in our page on [ free travel in
Ireland ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/free-travel/) .
