##  Opening a bank account

Before you [ open a bank account in Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/banking/opening-a-bank-account/) , you must show both:

  * [ Proof of identity ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/banking/financial-institutions-and-identification/) (such as a valid passport or driving licence) 
  * Proof of address (such as a recent utility bill). 

In general, this means you can’t open an Irish bank account until you have
arrived home. See ‘Non-resident bank accounts below’ for more details.

As it may take some time to establish proof of address in Ireland, you can
continue using your UK bank account in Ireland. The UK is still part of the
Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), which means you can use the IBAN from your
UK bank account for payments and transfers in euro.

For example, your Irish employer can pay wages into your UK account, and you
can set up direct debits with utility companies using your UK account.

finances/banking-and-returning-to-ireland/#219206) .

**Non-resident bank accounts**

Some banks in Ireland offer ‘non-resident’ accounts. This means you may be
able to set up an Irish bank account before you return home.

You still need to prove your identity (this requirement is set out in [ anti-
money laundering legislation ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-
and-tax/personal-finance/banking/money-laundering-in-ireland/) ), but the bank
may, for example, accept a foreign utility bill if it has been certified by a
solicitor or police officer.

Different banks have their own requirements, so you should contact your
preferred bank directly for advice.
