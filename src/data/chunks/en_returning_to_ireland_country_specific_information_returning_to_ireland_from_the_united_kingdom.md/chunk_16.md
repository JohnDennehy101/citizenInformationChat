##  Healthcare in Ireland

Public health services in Ireland are provided by the [ Health Service
Executive (HSE) ](https://www.gov.uk/transferring-your-pension/transferring-
to-an-overseas-pension-scheme) .

You are entitled to public health services free of charge or at a reduced cost
if:

  * You have been living in Ireland for at least a year 
  * You plan to live here for at least a year 

This is called being ‘ordinarily resident’ in Ireland.

You may have to pay for some health services in Ireland that you accessed in
the UK for free. For example, people in Ireland generally pay a fee for GP
appointments. However, you may be able to attend your GP for free if you
qualify for a [ medical card
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit card ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/tools-
and-calculators/mortgage-calculators/mortgage-calculator/) .
