###  **Renting**

Most rooms, flats, apartments, and houses to rent are advertised on
accommodation websites.

You may also find accommodation you can rent:

  * In the accommodation sections of newspapers 
  * In advertisements in shops 
  * On college notice boards 
  * At your student union, many of which keep accommodation lists 
  * By word of mouth 
  * By seeing 'To Let' signs on properties 
  * Through social media pages dedicated to finding and renting accommodation 
  * By using an accommodation or letting agency 

**What are letting agencies?**

Letting agencies (sometimes called ‘accommodation agencies’) are commercial
organisations that help you find places to rent. They may charge a fee. Before
registering with an agency, you should find out:

  * Is the agency licensed? 
  * What services does it offer? 
  * If you pay a fee, in what circumstances will you get a refund? 
  * If you decide to register with the agency, make sure you get a receipt for any money you pay. 

Consider these questions when viewing places to rent:

  * How much can you afford in rent and bills? 
  * What is the standard of the accommodation? 
  * What is the [ Building Energy Rating (BER) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/getting-a-building-energy-rating-for-your-home/) of the property? 
  * Where is the property located? Is it near your work or college? 
  * How long do you plan to stay there? 
  * Do you want to share a bedroom, bathroom, or kitchen?
