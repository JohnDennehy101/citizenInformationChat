###  **Primary and post-primary education**

There are 2 types of primary schools in Ireland:

  1. National primary schools (often called ‘national schools’) are funded by the State and do not charge fees 
  2. Private primary schools, which charge fees. 

Most children in Ireland go to a State-funded national primary school.

Children usually start post-primary school when they are 12 or 13 years of
age. Most children attend State-funded post-primary schools which do not
charge a fee.
