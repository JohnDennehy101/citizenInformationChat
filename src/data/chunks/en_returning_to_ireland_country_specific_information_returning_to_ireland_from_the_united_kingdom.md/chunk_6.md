###  **Applying for benefits**

In Ireland, the Department of Social Protection provides social welfare
benefits. Even though you are an Irish citizen, you must meet the [ habitual
residence condition (HRC) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-
to-ireland/applying-for-social-welfare/habitual-residence-condition/) to
qualify for certain payments, including [ Child Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/child-benefit/) and the [ State Pension (non-contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/state-pension-non-contributory/) .

This means you must be able to prove a close link to Ireland and show that you
plan to continue living here for the foreseeable future.

When deciding if you are habitually resident, the Department will consider:

  * How long you have lived in Ireland or any other country 
  * The reason you lived abroad 
  * The nature and pattern of your employment 
  * Actions taken that demonstrate you intend to stay in Ireland for more than a short period and establish lasting ties in the State 
  * Your plans to live in Ireland for the foreseeable future, according to the evidence provided
