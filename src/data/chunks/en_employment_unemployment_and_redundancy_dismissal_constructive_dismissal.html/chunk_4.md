###  Examples of constructive dismissal

The reason for leaving your job must be serious. Some examples include:

  * A serious breach of your contract (such as not paying you or demoting you for no reason) 
  * Forcing you to accept unreasonable changes to your conditions of employment without your agreement (for example changing your shift pattern) 
  * Allowing colleagues to bully or harass you at work where this behaviour goes unchecked by your employer 
  * Making you work in dangerous conditions 
  * Making false accusations against you, such as fraud or misconduct
