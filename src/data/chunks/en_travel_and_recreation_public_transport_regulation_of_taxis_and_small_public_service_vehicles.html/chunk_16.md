##  What are my legal responsibilities as a passenger?

Passengers have [ legal responsibilities
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2013/en/act/pub/0037/sec0029.html#sec29) too.
When travelling in a taxi, hackney, or limousine, you must:

  * Obey reasonable instructions, such as wearing your seatbelt or locking your door. You should also obey the driver if they ask you to leave the vehicle (because you are drunk or threatening for example). 
  * Not damage the vehicle. 
  * Not put the driver at risk. 
  * Not insist on having your pet carried. The only animals a SPSV driver must carry are guide dogs or other assistance dogs. 
  * Pay the fare.
