###  What should I do if I am charged too much?

If you have a dispute about the fare, you can make a complaint to the [
National Transport Authority ](http://www.transportforireland.ie/support/taxi-
compliments-complaints/) . If you booked the taxi through a dispatch operator,
you should complain there first. You should get a receipt and, if possible,
the driver’s details. You can read more in ‘How to make a complaint’ below.
