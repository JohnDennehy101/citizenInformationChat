##  What is the difference between a taxi, a hackney, and a limousine?

Taxis, hackneys, and limousines are licenced to carry passengers, but there
are differences in the types of services that they can provide.

**Taxis can** :

  * Be hailed down, or wait in taxi ranks for passengers 
  * Pick up passengers without pre-booking 
  * Be pre-booked (through an app or control station, or by prior arrangement with the taxi driver) 

**Taxis must** :

  * Be fitted with a taximeter (which displays and measures fares) 
  * Have information on how fares are calculated displayed inside the vehicle 
  * Be equipped with a physical device/terminal to accept cashless payments 
  * Obey the taxi fare rules set out by the NTA (see ‘how are fares calculated?’ below). 
  * Have a roof sign 
  * Be able to give receipts 

Wheelchair accessible taxis must also be able to accommodate at least one
person sitting in a wheelchair and one sitting passenger.

**Hackneys can** :

  * Be pre-booked only. They cannot be hailed down or pick up passengers waiting at taxi ranks. The exception is Local Area Hackneys, which are specially licenced to operate in rural communities and can use an approved hackney stand. 
  * Arrange prices in advance. They do not have to use a taximeter and there is no maximum fare. 

**Hackneys must:**

  * Display the driver’s hackney licence on the dashboard 
  * Be able to give receipts 

**Limousines must:**

  * Be suited in style and condition to ceremonial occasions. 
  * Be pre-booked. Limousines cannot be hailed down or pick up passengers on the street. 
  * Arrange prices in advance. They do not use a taximeter and there is no maximum fare.
