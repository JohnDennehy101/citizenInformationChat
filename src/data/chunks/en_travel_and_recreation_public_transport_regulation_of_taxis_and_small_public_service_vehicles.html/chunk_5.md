###  Initial charges, tariffs, and extras

When you start your journey, the **initial charge** is already on the meter.
This covers the first 500 meters of a journey or a period of 85 seconds.

After this, the fare will increase as time passes (if you are not moving, or
moving very little), or as distance is covered. The rate depends on the
**tariff** (either standard, premium or special premium). See the box below.

You may be charged for the following extras:

  * €1 for every extra adult passenger 
  * €1 for every two children under 12 (first child is free) 
  * Road tolls are charged in full 
  * €2 for pre-booking 
  * €140 (maximum) for soiling charge
