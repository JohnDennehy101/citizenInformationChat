##  How to complain

If you have a complaint, first contact the premium rate service provider to
give them a chance to fix the problem.

If you are not satisfied with the response, you can make a complaint to
ComReg. You must make the complaint **within 9 months** of using the service.
ComReg has discretion to accept complaints made outside this timeframe.

ComReg does not deal with disputes about the call cost of a premium rate
service. You must get in touch directly with the service provider to make your
complaint.
