###  Non-geographic numbers

A _non-geographic number_ (NGN) is a phone number that is not linked to a
specific geographic region or ‘area code’. An NGN is any phone number
beginning with 1800 and 0818.

**NGNs are not premium rate phone services** . Calls to 1800 numbers are free,
and calls to 0818 numbers cost the same as calling a landline number.
