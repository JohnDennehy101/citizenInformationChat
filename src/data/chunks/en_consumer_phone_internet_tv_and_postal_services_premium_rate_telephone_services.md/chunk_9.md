###  Authorisation to provide services

Premium rate services must be authorised by ComReg. Network operators must not
issue a Premium Rate Number or a SMS Short Code until they get the ComReg
letter of authorisation.

If a service is aimed at adults and not children, it must have an age warning.
This applies to competitions, all chat or dating services, ringtones and
logos, games and all subscription services.

For some services, you must get a price warning when you spend a certain
amount.

Service providers must provide a helpline to handle consumer queries and
complaints. This helpline must operate during normal office hours.
