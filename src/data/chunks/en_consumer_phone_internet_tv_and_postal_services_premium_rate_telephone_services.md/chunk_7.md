###  Unsubscribing from a text service

If you want to unsubscribe from a premium rate SMS Service you should:

  * Reply by text to the last message you received on your mobile 
  * Send the word STOP 

If you don't have a 5-digit number to send it to, ask your mobile phone
network operator for the number attached to the last message you received. You
should be unsubscribed within 48 hours of texting the word STOP.
