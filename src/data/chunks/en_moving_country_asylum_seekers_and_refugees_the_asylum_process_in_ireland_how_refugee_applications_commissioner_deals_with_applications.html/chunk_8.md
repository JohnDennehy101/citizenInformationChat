##  What the IPO looks at to make its recommendations

You must co-operate with the examining of your application. This means that
you must submit all the information that is needed, and to comply with all the
parts of the application process.

The IPO must examine your application individually. It must take into account:

  * All relevant facts relating to your country of origin 
  * Relevant statements and documentation presented by you, including information as to whether you have been or may be subject to persecution or serious harm 
  * Your position and personal circumstances, including factors like your age and gender 
  * Whether you could get the protection of another country where you could claim citizenship 
  * Your general credibility
