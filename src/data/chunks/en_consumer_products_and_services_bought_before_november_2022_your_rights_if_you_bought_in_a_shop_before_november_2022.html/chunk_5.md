merchantable quality, fit for purchase or as described. A remedy can be a [
repair, replacement, or refund. ](/en/consumer/shopping/problems-with-faulty-
goods/)

If the fault appears within the first 6 months, it is assumed that there was a
problem when you got the goods and it is up to the seller to prove otherwise.
If the fault appears after the first 6 months, you can be asked to prove that
there was a problem when you got it.
