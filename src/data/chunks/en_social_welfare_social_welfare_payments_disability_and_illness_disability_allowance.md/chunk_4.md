###  **Medical assessment**

Your doctor must complete a report on your medical condition as part of the
application form. This report is reviewed by one of the DSPâ€™s medical
assessors.

The medical report will allow the DSP to determine if you:

  * Have an injury, disease, or physical or mental disability that has continued for at least one year, or is expected to continue for at least one year, and 
  * Are _substantially_ restricted from doing work because of your disability, that would be suitable for a person of your age, experience and qualifications.
