###  **Can I get Disability Allowance in hospital or residential care?**

You can get Disability Allowance if you are in hospital or residential care.

If you are already getting DA and go into hospital or residential care, you
will continue to get your payment, as long as you continue to meet the
qualifying conditions above.

If you were not getting DA before you started living in residential care, you
can apply for DA.
