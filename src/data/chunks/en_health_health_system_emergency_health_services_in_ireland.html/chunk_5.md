##  GP out-of-hours co-operatives

In parts of Ireland, GPs have come together to form co-operatives providing a
medical service outside normal working hours. These co-operatives receive
financial assistance from the State. The co-operative may be based in a health
centre, public hospital or in another location, often provided by the Health
Service Executive. Participating GPs provide this service on a rota basis in
the evenings, at weekends and on bank and public holidays.

Generally the service is available to the patients of the GPs participating in
the co-op. It is necessary to telephone a contact number to access the service
and the appropriate care may be telephone advice by a nurse or doctor. Care
may also include attendance at a treatment centre or a visit to your home by
the doctor on duty.

Medical card and GP visit card holders don't have to pay for the services
provided by the GP out-of-hours co-operatives. Other patients have to pay a
fee.
