##  Family doctor (GP) emergency care

If you wish to attend your family doctor (GP) as a result of an emergency you
can:

  * Attend at a surgery operated by your GP during specific hours. You can find out what these hours are by contacting your GP. 
  * Phone your GP and ask for them to visit you during the time set aside for house calls. 
  * Phone your GP outside normal hours â€“ the answering machine will usually indicate the number to ring in emergencies. This number may be a locum service or out-of-hours service. A locum service is one in which another doctor (not your GP) calls to the home of patients outside normal hours. 
  * Visit a GP out-of-hours co-operative.
