##  How the process works?

You need to use a private company registered with the SEAI to access this
grant (also known as [ One Stop Shops ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-
energy-grants/one-stop-shop/) ). They will manage the whole project for you,
bringing your home up to a BER rating of B2 or above.

The company will:

  * Complete an initial energy assessment of your home and advise you on the upgrades you need to bring it up to a B2 BER rating or higher 
  * Apply and accept the SEAI grants for your home 
  * Assign a contractor to do the work on your home 
  * Manage the works at your home ensuring that everything is up to standard 
  * Complete the final BER assessment when the work is done 

These companies deduct the grants from the cost of the works in advance, so
you only pay what is outstanding. Some of these operators also provide finance
options, so you have different ways to pay for the outstanding cost of the
works.
