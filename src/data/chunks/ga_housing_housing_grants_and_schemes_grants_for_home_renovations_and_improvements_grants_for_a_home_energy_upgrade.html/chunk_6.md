##  How much are the grants?

The table below shows the grant amount available for each energy upgrade. The
amount you get for each upgrade can depend on the type of home you have. For
example, the grant you get to insulate a detached house is more than the grant
you get to insulate an apartment.

The One-Stop-Shop will assess your home and recommend the work needed to get
your home up to a BER B2 rating.
