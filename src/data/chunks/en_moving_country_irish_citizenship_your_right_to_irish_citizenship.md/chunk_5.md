###  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts

The Constitution of Ireland allows the Oireachtas to make laws to decide who
can become an Irish citizen after the enactment of the Constitution (in 1937).
The most important citizenship law that was passed after 1937 was the [ Irish
Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1956
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1956/act/26/enacted/en/html) .

This Act had a number of important provisions:

  * Anyone born in Ireland was automatically an Irish citizen. People who were born in Northern Ireland were entitled to be Irish citizens if they chose it. 
  * A Foreign Births Register was established for descendants of Irish citizens born abroad. 
  * Wives of Irish citizens (but not husbands) could claim Irish citizenship by signing a post-nuptial declaration. This practice ended in 2005. 
  * Rules for naturalisation were set out. 

The Act was amended a number of times, most importantly in 2004, following the
[ 27th Amendment to the Constitution
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/ca/27/enacted/en/print#sec1) . This
removed the automatic right to Irish [ citizenship by birth ](/en/moving-
country/irish-citizenship/irish-citizenship-through-birth-or-descent/) to all
those born in Ireland.
