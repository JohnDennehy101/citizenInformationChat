##  Introduction

Ireland is a sovereign, independent country and has rules and laws about who
is entitled to Irish citizenship.

Most Irish citizens were automatically [ Irish when they were born
](/en/moving-country/irish-citizenship/irish-citizenship-through-birth-or-
descent/) . Before 1 January 2005, everyone born on the island of Ireland was
an Irish citizen by birth. Following an amendment to the [ Constitution of
Ireland ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-
introduction/) , citizenship by birth is no longer an automatic entitlement to
everyone born on the island of Ireland.

If you are born abroad, you are entitled to Irish citizenship if your parent
was born in Ireland. If your grandparents were born in Ireland, you may also
be able to claim citizenship through the [ Foreign Births Register
](/en/moving-country/irish-citizenship/foreign-births-register/) .

Residents of Ireland who have come from abroad can apply to become [ Irish
citizens through naturalisation ](/en/moving-country/irish-
citizenship/becoming-an-irish-citizen-through-naturalisation/) .

Citizens of Ireland are also EU citizens, which means that they can live, work
and study in any other EU member state.

This page describes who can claim or apply for Irish citizenship, the rights
that Irish citizens enjoy and answers some general questions on Irish
citizenship law.
