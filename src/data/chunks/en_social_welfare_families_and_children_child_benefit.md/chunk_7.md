###  **Working or living in the UK**

The rules for getting Child Benefit continue as they did before [ the UK left
the EU (Brexit) ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/what-is-
brexit/) .

This means:

  * If you work in the UK and live in Ireland, you can continue getting your UK Child Benefit and a top-up of Irish Child Benefit. 
  * If you work in Ireland and live in the UK, you can continue getting your Irish Child Benefit. 
  * If you work and live in Ireland with your children, and your partner (spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant) works in the UK, you should apply for Child Benefit in Ireland.
