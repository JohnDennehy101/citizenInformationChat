##  What is a trade union?

A trade union is an organisation that represents and protects the rights and
interests of its members. Members are employees in a particular sector or job,
for example, teaching or nursing.

A trade union must have a [ negotiating licence
](https://dbei.gov.ie/en/Publications/Guidelines-and-Application-Form-for-
Trade-Union-Negotiation-Licence.html) to negotiate employee wages and other
conditions of employment.

The [ Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) ](http://www.ictu.ie/) is the
umbrella organisation for trade unions, representing a range of interests of
ICTU members, both in Ireland and in Northern Ireland. ICTU has information if
you want to [ join a union ](https://ictu.ie/join-union) .
