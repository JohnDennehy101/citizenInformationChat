###  Cases without an oral hearing

Some cases do not involve an oral hearing with witnesses giving evidence in
court. Instead, these cases are dealt with using only affidavits.

For example, if the plaintiff (the person bringing the case) issues a [
summary summons ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-
law/high-court-procedures/#a179e8) , it will be accompanied by an affidavit
setting out the facts of the case. The defendant can then respond by swearing
their own affidavit.

The judge may be able to decide the case by reading the affidavits, which is a
quicker and less expensive procedure.
