##  Staying in another EU state for up to 90 days

As an EU citizen, EEA or Swiss national, you can travel within the territory
of the European Union, the EEA and Switzerland. You do not need a visa to
travel to another EU, EEA country or Switzerland and your passport should not
be stamped upon exiting your country or entering another country.

EU countries must not set conditions (other than needing a passport or
national identity card, or to report their presence to the authorities) for EU
citizens to enter their country.

This means that you should not be asked to prove that you have an offer of
employment, money to live off, are registered with a college, or have any
other particular business or purpose to visiting the EU member state.

EU citizens, EEA or Swiss nationals who arrive in Ireland must have a passport
or national identity card. If you are travelling in mainland Europe, you may
be allowed to move between countries without showing your passport or identity
card (in [ the Schengen Area ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/european-union/schengen-area/) ).

Family members of EU, EEA or Swiss citizens, who are not citizens themselves,
may have to apply for a visa to enter Ireland. See ‘ [ Family members
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/freedom-of-
movement-in-the-eu#ld773b) ’ below.

Your right to stay in an EU, EEA country or Switzerland for up to 90 days
could be cancelled if you become an _unreasonable burden_ on the social
assistance system of the member state. If you have recently moved to Ireland,
have not been able to find work, and have no money to support yourself, the
Irish state does not have to pay you social assistance. See ‘ [ Restrictions
on freedom of movement ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/european-union/freedom-of-movement-in-the-eu#l2cfe4) ' below.
