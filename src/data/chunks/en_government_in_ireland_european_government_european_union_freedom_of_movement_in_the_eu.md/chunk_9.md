##  Restrictions on freedom of movement

A member state can restrict free movement on the grounds of:

  * Public policy 
  * Public security 
  * Public health 

This means that you could be expelled from the EU/EEA country or Switzerland
where you live in some circumstances. The longer you have lived legally in
that country, the stronger the safeguards against being removed and returned
to your country of nationality.

A Removal Order cannot be _disproportionate_ . In other words, a country could
be breaking EU law if they remove you without good reason and without an
examination of the facts of your case.

Before a decision is made on granting a Removal Order against you, the member
state must consider:

  * The length of your stay in the country 
  * How well you are integrated (for example, your work history) 
  * Your age and health 
  * How removing you would impact other family members who would remain in the State 
  * The links you have to your country of origin 

You may also be removed if you have lost your residency rights. This could
happen if you have not found work after 3 months of residence and are not able
to support yourself.
