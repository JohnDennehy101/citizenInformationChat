##  Refugees and asylum seekers

If you have claimed asylum in an EU member state, then you must stay in that
country while your application is being processed. The [ Dublin III Regulation
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/dublin-convention/) sets out the rules on where a claim for
international protection (asylum) should be made within the European Union.
