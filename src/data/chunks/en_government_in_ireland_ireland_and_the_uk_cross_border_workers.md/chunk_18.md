###  Maternity and paternity payments and services

If you are working in Northern Ireland, you can choose to have your baby there
and access healthcare services. This does not apply to you if only your
partner (the partner who is not pregnant) works in NI.

The country you work in is responsible for your Maternity Benefit. If you are
working in NI, you should apply for [ Statutory Maternity Pay
](https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave) there. If your partner is working in
Northern Ireland, they can claim [ Paternity Pay
](https://www.gov.uk/paternity-pay-leave) through their employer. If your
partner is working in Ireland they can claim [ paternity and parental benefits
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/payments-to-families-and-children/)
there.
