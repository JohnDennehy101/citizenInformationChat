##  What is a cross border worker?

A cross border worker (also called a ‘frontier worker’) is a person who lives
in one country and works in another country, returning to the country they
live in at least once a week.

For example, if you live in Ireland and work in Northern Ireland, you are a
cross border worker if you return to your home in Ireland at least once a
week.

The rules covering cross border workers on the island of Ireland have changed
because Northern Ireland is no longer part of the EU.

How these new rules affect you depends on your nationality and if you were
already a cross border worker before 1 January 2021.
