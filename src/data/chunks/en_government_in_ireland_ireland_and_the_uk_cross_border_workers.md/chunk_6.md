were working there. If you have spent more time in the UK than 180 days, you
can still qualify if you have returned to Ireland at least once every 6
months, or twice in 12 months.

You may qualify for the Permit if you stopped working in the UK but **retained
your worker status** . You can keep your worker status if you stopped working
because:

  * You had an illness or an accident. 
  * You became involuntarily unemployed. You must have registered as a jobseeker and have proof that you were looking for work in the UK while you were out of work. You can keep your worker status for:

    * As long as you were continuing to look for work, if you worked in the UK for a year or more 
  * You became voluntarily unemployed and started vocational training related to the work you were doing.
