##  Social welfare

In general, the country you work in is responsible for paying social welfare
payments. For example, if you are working in Northern Ireland and your family
lives in Ireland, the UK pays [ Child Benefit
](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/how-claim-benefit) . But if the rate of
Child Benefit you get in the UK is less than [ Child Benefit in Ireland
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/) , you can apply to
get your payment topped up by Ireland.

[ Ireland and the UK have agreed ](https://www.dfa.ie/brexit/getting-ireland-
brexit-ready/brexit-and-you/common-travel-area/) to continue paying social
welfare to cross border workers and to recognise insurance contributions
(national insurance or PRSI) paid in the other country, in the same way as
when the UK was part of the EU.
