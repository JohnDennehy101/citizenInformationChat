###  Unemployment payments

If you are lose your job completely you claim benefits from the country where
you live. But if you have reduced hours or you are working casually, you apply
for benefits in the country where you work.

For example, if you are made redundant from your job in Northern Ireland and
you live in Ireland, you claim [ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) or [ Jobseeker’s Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) from your local
INTREO office in Ireland.

If your job in Northern Ireland reduces your hours, you must apply for
benefits in Northern Ireland.
