####  Affordable Childcare Scheme

From September 2017 a new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme will provide a
targeted subsidy, based on parental income, for children aged between 6 months
and 15 years and a universal subsidy, for all families, for children aged
between 6 months and 3 years.

**Targeted subsidy:** The highest level of subsidy will be provided to those
on incomes up to €22,700 net per annum – this will be approximately €8,000 a
year, based on the maximum of 40-hours childcare a week. The rate of subsidy
will taper downwards as net income rises, with no targeted subsidy payable
when net income reaches €47,500. The income thresholds increase if there is
more than one child in the family.

**Universal subsidy:** Up to €80 per month will be provided towards childcare
costs. This equates to over €900 per annum for parents working full-time and
will be paid pro-rata.

Both of these subsidies will be paid for children attending a Tusla-registered
childcare provider – including centre-based providers and child minders.
