###  After the work is done

When the work is completed, the contractor will give you documentation about
the work, including any warranties. It is important to keep these safe, as you
may need them in the future.

[ A Building Energy Rating (BER) ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/getting-a-building-energy-rating-for-your-home/) is carried out on all
homes after the works are complete to assess the building’s energy
performance. A [ BER certificate ](http://www.seai.ie/energy-ratings/building-
energy-rating-ber/) and advisory report will be sent to you and will also be
published on the [ SEAI’s national BER register
](https://ndber.seai.ie/pass/ber/search.aspx) .

Some homes will also be inspected to ensure that the works meet the required
standards.
