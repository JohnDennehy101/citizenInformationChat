##  Introduction

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provides free home energy
upgrades to homeowners who get certain social welfare payments. These upgrades
help improve the energy efficiency and warmth of your home and are also known
as the Warmer Homes Scheme.

The scheme prioritises the oldest and least energy efficient homes. You can
apply for the free upgrades again if youâ€™ve already had work done under the
scheme, but your home would benefit from more upgrades. To access the scheme
again you must still meet the qualifying criteria.

If you do not qualify for the free upgrades, the SEAI provides other grants to
help with the cost of upgrading the energy efficiency of your home. The [
National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/grants-for-a-home-energy-
upgrade/) provides grants to bring your home up to an energy efficiency rating
of B2 or above, using a private company to manage the work. Or, you can get [
individual energy upgrade grants ](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-
schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/better-energy-homes-
scheme/) , if you only want to do certain upgrades, and would prefer to manage
the process yourself.
