###  Getting the work done

If your home is suitable for the upgrades a contractor will be appointed by
the SEAI to do the work on your home.

The contractor will visit your home to assess the works needed. They will then
explain their recommendations to you, and agree a schedule for the work. You
should have a written contract with the contractor, which clearly states the
work you have agreed to.
