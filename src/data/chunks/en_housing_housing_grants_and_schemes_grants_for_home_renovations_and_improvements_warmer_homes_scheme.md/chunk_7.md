###  Is my home suitable?

The SEAI will review your application and if you are eligible. They will then
assess if your home is suitable for the work. A surveyor acting for the SEAI
will arrange to call to your home to do this. They will complete a survey of
your home, which involves:

  * Walking around the inside and outside of your home, including the attic 
  * Assessing the overall suitability of your home for energy efficiency upgrades 
  * Measuring, photographing and recording information about your home 
  * Discussing their findings with you, outlining what work you should get and answering any questions you have
