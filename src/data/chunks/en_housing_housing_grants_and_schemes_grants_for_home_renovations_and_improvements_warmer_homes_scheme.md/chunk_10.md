##  How much will it cost?

You will not be charged for work done under this scheme. However, if you sell
your home within 5 years of getting the work done, you need to tell the SEAI.
You should inform them in writing at least 30 days before your property is
sold. The SEAI may ask you to repay some or all of the grant. This is at their
discretion.
