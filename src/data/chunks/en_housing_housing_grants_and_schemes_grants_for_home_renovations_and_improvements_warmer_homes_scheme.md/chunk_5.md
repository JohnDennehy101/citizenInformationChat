##  How does the scheme work?

There are 4 steps to this process:

  1. Apply for the scheme [ online ](https://onlinewhs.powerappsportals.com/) or by completing an [ application form (pdf) ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/fully-funded-upgrades-for-eligible-homes/WHS-Application-Form.pdf) and sending it back to the SEAI. You must ensure you meet the qualifying criteria above when applying. You can use the [ SEAI online portal ](https://onlinewhs.powerappsportals.com/) to check if you qualify. 
  2. Have an SEAI surveyor check your home is suitable for the works and recommend upgrades. The SEAI will do this if you qualify. 
  3. Get the works done by a contractor appointed by the SEAI 
  4. Get the works assessed by the SEAI once the works are completed. This will include a new BER assessment and may involve a quality inspection.
