##  What is a service?

Consumer law covers many contracts for services. Examples of services covered
include entertainment, accommodation, transport, building works and
maintenance contracts. Personal services (for example wedding photography),
pet care services, storage facilities and legal or other professional services
are also covered.

If you have a contract for a service, consumer law sets out the minimum
standards that apply and the remedies if the service falls short of these
standards.
