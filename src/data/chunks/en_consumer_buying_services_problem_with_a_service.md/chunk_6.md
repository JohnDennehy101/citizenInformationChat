###  What you must do to end the contract

You must tell the supplier that the contract is being terminated - you can do
this verbally or in writing.

Any goods you got under the service contract must be returned to the supplier
unless this would cause disproportionate inconvenience to you or would damage
your property. Alternatively, you can agree for the supplier to collect or
return the goods. The supplier can withhold your refund if you do not keep to
what was agreed for the collection or return of the goods.

You must not use the service you are cancelling and you must make sure nobody
else uses it.

Where a service contract is terminated, any ancillary contract is also
automatically terminated. An ancillary contract is any legal agreement
established in addition to the original contract.
