##  Right to a price reduction

If you prefer, you can ask for a proportionate reduction in price. A
proportionate reduction in price must reflect the reduced value of the
services to you.

If the issue with the service is minor, you can only ask for a price
reduction. If there is a dispute as to whether the issues are minor or not, it
is up to the supplier to prove that they are.
