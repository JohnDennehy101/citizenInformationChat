##  Buying a home together

When buying a home with your partner, you will need to decide whether to
register the property with land registry as either:

  * Joint tenants, or 
  * Tenants-in-common 

Before you make your decision, it is important that you understand the nature
of each type of ownership and title. How you will co-own the property can
affect your capacity to deal with the property in the future.

Always get professional legal advice before choosing a home ownership option.
