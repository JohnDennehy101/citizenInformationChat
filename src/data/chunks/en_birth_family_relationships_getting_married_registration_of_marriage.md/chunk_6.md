##  Registration of marriages outside Ireland

Marriages of Irish citizens abroad are normally registered in the country
where they happen. The [ General Register Office
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/General-Register-Office.aspx) (central civil
repository for records relating to births, deaths and marriages in Ireland)
has no role in the registration of marriages of Irish citizen(s) that take
place abroad, or in advising on such marriages. Marriages that take place
outside the State are not registered in Ireland.

Your foreign marriage certificate will usually be accepted for official
purposes in Ireland where you need to show evidence that you are married. If
the certificate is in a foreign language, you must provide an official
translation or a translation from a recognised translation agency.
