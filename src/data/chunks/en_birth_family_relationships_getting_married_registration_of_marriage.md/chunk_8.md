##  Getting a copy of your marriage certificate

To get a copy of a marriage certificate, you will need to give the date (or
approximate date if not known) and place of the marriage, and the full names
of the couple before they married.

If you got married in Ireland (whether by civil, secular or religious
ceremony) you can order a copy of your marriage certificate [ online
](https://certificatespublic-webapp-
prod.azurewebsites.net/Certs/ApplicantDetails) (full standard certificates
only), [ by post using an application form (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/41368/54a468251ce84642b6d14043ca5a481c.pdf) , by phone
or in person at any [ Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-
registration-service.html) .

You must pay €2 for postage of online orders in Ireland, and €3 per order
outside of Ireland. Delivery time depends on how long it takes to locate the
certificate and where it is being posted to. You will get a full refund if the
record cannot be found.
