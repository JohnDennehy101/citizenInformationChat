##  Can I get tax relief if I have an assistance dog?

If you have a trained assistance dog, you can claim €825 as a [ tax relief on
health expenses ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/taxation-and-medical-expenses/) . This relief is given at the standard
income tax rate of 20%, so it reduces your tax by €165 (20% of €825).

To qualify, your dog must have been supplied by an organisation that is
accredited by [ Assistance Dogs Europe
](https://assistancedogsinternational.org/main/assistance-dogs-international-
europe-regional-chapter-adeu/) . Assistance Dogs Europe is the European branch
of Assistance Dogs International (ADI), a group of non-profit programmes that
train and place assistance dogs.
