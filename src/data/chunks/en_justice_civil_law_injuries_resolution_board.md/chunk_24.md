###  Legal costs

In civil cases, the court usually awards [ costs
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/civil-law/legal-fees-and-
costs-for-civil-cases/) to the person who wins the case. This means that if
your case is successful, the court will order the respondent to pay your legal
fees. There are some exceptions to this in personal injuries cases.

Even if you win, you will usually still pay the respondent’s costs if:

  * You went to court because you did not agree with the amount of compensation that the Board awarded, and 
  * The respondent did agree with the amount, and 
  * The court awards less than that amount 

You may also be ordered to pay costs if you didn’t comply with requests from
the Injuries Resolution Board.

For example, if you did not:

  * Provide information that the Injuries Resolution Board requested, or 
  * Attend a medical examination arranged by the Board 

If you did not inform the respondent of your intention to take a personal
injuries case within one month of the accident, this could also affect your
claim for legal costs.
