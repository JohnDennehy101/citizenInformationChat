####  **Either party rejects the assessment**

If either you or the respondent rejects the assessment, the Injuries
Resolution Board will issue you with an _Authorisation_ allowing you to take
your claim to court.

If the court awards you a lower amount than the Injuries Resolution Board did,
you will generally have to pay the respondent’s legal costs as well as your
own (see ‘Taking a case to court’ below).
