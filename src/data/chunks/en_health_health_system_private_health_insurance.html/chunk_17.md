Companies can offer contracts that are limited to certain health services,
such as dental and optical services. These limited contracts do not have to
meet the general principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime
cover.

They may also offer contracts in relation to GP and out-patient services only
without having to meet minimum benefit requirements (described below).

Alternatively, [ cash plans (pdf)
](https://www.hia.ie/sites/default/files/2022-11/june-2017-cash-plans.pdf)
provide money for certain medical events for example, a physiotherapy visit.
Unlike in-patient health insurance policies, they donâ€™t provide cover for a
hospital stay as a private patient.
