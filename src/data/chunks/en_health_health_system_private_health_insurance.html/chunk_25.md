###  **Risk equalisation**

The costs for insurers are different depending on the age and health profile
of their members. The HIA tries to balance out these differences in insurers'
costs through the [ Risk Equalisation Scheme
](http://www.hia.ie/regulation/risk-equalisation/) .

Under the Risk Equalisation Scheme, the HIA pays health credits to insurers to
compensate them for the higher costs of insuring members over 65 and members
who make more health insurance claims.

Each insurer pays an annual levy on each policy to help fund the health
credits.
