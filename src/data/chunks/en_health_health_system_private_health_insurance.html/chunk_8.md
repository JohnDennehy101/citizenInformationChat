####  Waiting periods if you switch insurance company

You can usually switch your health insurance company without a loss of cover
if you complete the switch within 13 weeks of the previous policy ending.

In this case, you do not have to serve a waiting period again if you have
already served a waiting period for a pre-existing condition, or a waiting
period due to your age when first taking out private health insurance. See
below for more information about waiting periods when you switch.
