####  **Breaks and stops in health insurance**

If you previously had health insurance, you can be given credit for the time
you were insured. This will reduce your loading.

If you have a break in cover of less than 13 weeks this will not affect your
loading.

If you stopped your insurance cover for periods of unemployment since 1
January 2008, up to three years of credits can be provided.
