##  How to apply

You must apply directly to the health insurance company that you want to join.
Each company must follow [ certain laws
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1994/act/16/front/revised/en/html) but,
after that, they are free to make their own rules.

The level of cover available and the rates charged vary from one company to
another.

Health insurance policies are usually 12-month contracts. If you want to
switch insurer or insurance plan, you may do so at your next renewal date.
Insurers may [ charge you a cancellation fee if you want to switch plans or
cancel during the 12 month term ](https://www.hia.ie/consumer-
information/cancelling-and-switching) .

You must give all relevant information to the insurance company. If you do
not, then the entire contract may be void. An insurer cannot charge you extra
if you have a medical condition.
