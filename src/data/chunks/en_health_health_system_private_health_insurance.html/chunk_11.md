####  **Charges if you start health insurance at 35 years or older**

Higher charges apply if you are 35 years of age or older when you first take
out health insurance. If you are aged 35 or above but you already have health
insurance, the cost of your health insurance will not change based on your
age.

There is a 2% increase in price (known as a loading) for each year over 34
years of age. For example:

  * If you are 35, the cost is 2% higher than for a person aged 34 
  * If you are 44, the cost is 20% higher (2% x 10 years). 

The longest you will have to pay a loading for is 10 years.
