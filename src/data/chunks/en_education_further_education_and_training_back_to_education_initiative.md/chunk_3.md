##  Who can qualify for the Back to Education Initiative?

The Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) provides part-time courses for adults
and young people aged over 16 who left school with few or no formal
qualifications or low literacy levels.

The groups given priority access to the BTEI are listed in the [ Back to
Education Initiative Operational Guidelines (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f4113d-operational-guidelines-back-to-
education-part-time-education-option/) . Within these groups, priority is
given to people most educationally disadvantaged.

You can also take part in BTEI if you are working and on a low income. The aim
of BTEI is to give people an opportunity to combine their learning with
family, work and other commitments.
