###  Energy conservation  

Capital funding of €13 million will go towards energy conservation, for
insulation, efficiency and building rating schemes and for a range of
initiatives which will promote new technologies, increase awareness of energy
efficiency and improve capacity to deliver in this area.

There is an allocation of €7 million capital funding to energy research which
will mainly fund measures to develop renewable energy from ocean sources.

The VAT rate on the supply of elephant grass rhizomes, seeds, bulbs, roots and
similar supplies used for the agricultural production of bio-fuels will be
reduced from 21% to 13.5% with effect from 1 March 2008.
