##  Valuing land or other buildings with your property

When you value your residential property, you include the value of related
land and buildings. These are lands or buildings that have a residential or
domestic purpose or that have value as amenities. For example, this could be
a:

  * Yard, garden or patio 
  * Driveway or parking space 
  * Garage, shed or greenhouse 
  * Garden room or home office 

If the land is larger than one acre, you only need to include land up to one
acre (0.4047 hectares). This should be the area that is most suitable for
enjoyment with the residential property, this is usually the land closest to
the property.
