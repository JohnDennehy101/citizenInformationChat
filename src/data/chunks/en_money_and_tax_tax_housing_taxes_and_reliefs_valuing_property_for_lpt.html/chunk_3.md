##  How to value your property

LPT is a self-assessment tax. This means that you calculate the tax you have
to pay based on your own assessment of the market value of your property.
Revenue does not value properties for LPT but it provides an online valuation
tool and guidance on how you can value your property yourself.

You should use information about properties that are similar to yours, for
example, properties that are a similar type, age and size.

You should keep a copy of any information sources that you use and any other
supporting documentation. Revenue may request this from you if it reviews your
assessment.
