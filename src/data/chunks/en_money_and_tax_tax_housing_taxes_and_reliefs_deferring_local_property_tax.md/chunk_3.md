##  Deferral of LPT based on income

You may qualify for full or partial deferral of LPT for a property you own and
live in if your income is below a certain amount.

You qualify for deferral each year based on your estimated gross income for
the previous year. So, for example, if you were liable for LPT on 1 November
2023 (the liability date) you would [ estimate your gross income
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/deferral-of-
payment/income-thresholds.aspx) for 2023 to see whether you qualify for
deferral or partial deferral of the payment in 2024.

If you have an outstanding mortgage, the income threshold is increased by 80%
of your gross mortgage interest payments. The mortgage must have been taken
out before 1 November 2020. You cannot avail of this deferral if you have
taken out your mortgage since 1 November 2020.

_Gross income_ is your income before any deductions, allowances or reliefs. It
includes income that is exempt from income tax and income from Department of
Social Protection (DSP) payments, but it does not include Child Benefit.

_Couples_ include married people, people in a civil partnership and certain
cohabitants. For LPT deferral purposes, cohabitants must have lived together
for at least 2 years if you have children and 5 years if you do not have
children.

If you claimed a deferral for a year and your circumstances change you must
inform Revenue.
