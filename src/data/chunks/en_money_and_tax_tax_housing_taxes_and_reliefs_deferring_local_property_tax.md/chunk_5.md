###  Deferral for personal representatives of a deceased liable person

[ When a person dies, their property passes to their personal representative.
](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/what-happens-the-deceaseds-estate/) The
personal representative then has the duty to distribute the deceased person's
money and property in accordance with the will or with the laws of intestacy
if there is no will.

The personal representatives of a deceased person may apply for a deferral of
LPT until the earlier of either:

  * The date on which the property is transferred or sold 
  * 3 years after the date of death 

To qualify for deferral, the deceased person must have been the sole owner of
the property but it does not need to have been their main residence.

You can claim a deferral for any LPT outstanding at the date of death, any LPT
already deferred by the deceased person and LPT that became payable following
the death.
