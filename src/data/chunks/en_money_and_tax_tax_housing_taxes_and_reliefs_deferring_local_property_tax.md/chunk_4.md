##  Deferral following a death

If one member of a couple who qualified for a deferral dies, the deferral will
remain in place until the next valuation date (currently 1 November 2025) and
the income of the surviving person is not taken into account until then.

On 1 November 2025, the surviving person may make a claim for deferral of the
tax. If you satisfy the conditions, you will qualify for deferral. If you do
not qualify for deferral after 2025, the amount that was deferred up to the
end of 2025 may continue to be deferred. Interest will continue to be charged
on the deferred amount in the usual way.

If you inherit a property from someone who is not your spouse, civil partner
or cohabitant, Revenue may allow the deferral to continue if you apply for a
deferral and qualify. The transfer of the property to you means that the tax
deferred (plus interest) becomes payable at that point if you do not meet the
conditions for a deferral in your own right.
