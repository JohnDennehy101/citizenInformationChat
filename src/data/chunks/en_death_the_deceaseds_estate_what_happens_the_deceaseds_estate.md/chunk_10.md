###  Cohabiting partners

Partners, who live with each other but are not married or in a civil
partnership, have no automatic legal right to each other's estates, although
under the [ redress scheme for cohabiting couples ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/redress-scheme-
for-cohabiting-couples/) introduced by the [ Civil Partnership and Certain
Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0024/index.html) a qualified
cohabitant can apply for a share of the estate of a deceased cohabitant.

You can leave some or all of your estate to your partner but this does not
cancel out the legal rights of a spouse or civil partner if you were married
before to someone else and did not get divorced or had your civil partnership
dissolved.
