###  Where a legal right share does not apply

Your spouse or civil partner can renounce (give up) their rights to the legal
right share. This can be part of an agreement before marriage or civil
partnership or the spouse or civil partner can give up their rights to benefit
their children or other named beneficiaries.

If there is evidence of undue influence or evidence that the spouse or civil
partner did not understand what they were doing, the renunciation may be
challenged. It is normally advised that a spouse or civil partner get
independent legal advice if renouncing their legal right share.

The legal right share can be lost where the spouse or civil partner is:

  * Convicted of the murder, manslaughter or attempted murder of the deceased person 
  * Convicted of an offence against the deceased person or a child that carries a sentence of more than 2 years
