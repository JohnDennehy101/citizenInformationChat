###  The family or shared home

The surviving spouse or civil partner may ask to keep the family or shared
home instead of their legal right share, although if the house is worth more
than the legal right share, the spouse or civil partner may have to pay the
difference into the deceased's estate. A court may decide that this sum does
not have to be paid if it would cause undue hardship
