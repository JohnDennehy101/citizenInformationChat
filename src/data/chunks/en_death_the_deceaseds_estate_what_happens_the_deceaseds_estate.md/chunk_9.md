###  Divorce, separation and desertion

Separation agreements usually include a renunciation of both spouses’ or civil
partner’s legal right share.

If you are divorced or your civil partnership was dissolved, you do not have
to provide a legal right share.

If your spouse or civil partner deserted you for more than 2 years, they are
not entitled to a legal right share unless they deserted you as a result of
your behaviour (for example, domestic abuse).
