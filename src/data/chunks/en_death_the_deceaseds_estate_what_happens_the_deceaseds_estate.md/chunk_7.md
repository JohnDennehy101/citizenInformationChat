##  The legal right share

If you have left a will, and your spouse or civil partner has never renounced
or given up their rights to your estate, then they are entitled to a legal
right share of your estate. This legal right share is:

  * One-half of your estate if you do not have children 
  * One-third of your estate if you do have children 

Your spouse/civil partner does not have to go to court to get this share, as
your executor must give this share where applicable. If you leave a gift to
your spouse or civil partner in your will, they can choose to accept the gift
instead of their legal right share, or they can insist on their legal right
share (the specific gift can form part of the legal right share, but if it is
less then your spouse can request more from the estate).

Your executor must inform your spouse or civil partner in writing of their
right to choose between these two options. Your spouse or civil partner must
ask for their legal right share within 6 months of being notified, or within
12 months of the taking out of the Grant of Representation.
