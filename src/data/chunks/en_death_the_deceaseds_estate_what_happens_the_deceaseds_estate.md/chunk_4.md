###  Bank accounts in joint names

If the bank account is in the joint names of the deceased and the deceased's
spouse or civil partner, the money can usually be transferred into the
survivor's name. You will need the death certificate to do this.

If the bank account is in the joint names of the deceased person and someone
else, and the bank was given instructions when the account was opened that the
other person was to receive the money on the death of the deceased, the money
can be transferred into the survivor's name.

If there is an account with more than â‚¬50,000, you will also need a [ letter
of clearance ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/gains-gifts-and-
inheritance/documents/form-ca4.pdf) from Revenue allowing the money to be
transferred to the surviving account holder's name pending investigations
about CAT liability.

Spouses and civil partners are not liable for [ Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT)
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/) on
inheritances from each other.

Where the bank has no instructions, the intentions of the deceased person will
have to be examined (for example, by referring to their will)
