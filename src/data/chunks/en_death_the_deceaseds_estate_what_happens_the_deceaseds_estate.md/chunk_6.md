##  Occupational and personalpensions

The rules governing occupational and personal pensions depend on the terms of
the pension. If the deceased person was a member of a pension scheme, you
should contact the scheme administrators to find out if there is a pension for
the spouse, civil partner and/or children. Self-employed people may have
pension arrangements that involve some of the investments becoming part of the
deceased's estate.

Divorced people and those whose civil partnership has been dissolved may have
access to some part of the pension scheme depending on whether or not a [
pension adjustment order ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/sep-divorce-pensions/) was made at the time of the divorce or
dissolution.
