##  Starting work and getting paid

Within 5 days of starting a new job, your employer should tell you in writing:

  * How much you’ll be paid and how often 
  * How many hours you are expected to work in a normal week 
  * How long your contract is for (only applies to temporary or fixed-term contracts) 

You have a right to get a [ payslip

either when you get paid or shortly after.

The national minimum wage for people aged 20 or over in Ireland is €12.70 per
hour since 1 January 2024.
