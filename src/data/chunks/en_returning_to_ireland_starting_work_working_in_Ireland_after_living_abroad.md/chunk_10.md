####  Jobseekerâ€™s Benefit

This is a payment given to unemployed people who are looking for work and who
have paid enough PRSI contributions. It is not means tested.

If you are applying for [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) and you need contributions you paid in another EU
or EEA country to help you qualify, then your last contribution must have been
paid in Ireland.
