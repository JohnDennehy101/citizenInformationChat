##  How to stop unwanted cold calls

Contact your service provider and tell them that you do not want to get direct
marketing calls. This will be recorded on the NDD ‘do not call register’,
within 5 working days of you making the request. Companies in Ireland are then
banned from calling you for direct marketing purposes.

You can make a complaint if:

  * You get a call more than 28 days after your details are recorded in the ‘do not call register’ 
  * You have told the company not to contact you again 

If your number is ex-directory, your number should be automatically recorded
as not wanting to receive direct marketing calls. This applies in all cases,
unless you have changed your preference to allow them to contact you. Ex-
directory means your number is not listed in phone books or with directory
enquiries.

The Commission for Communications Regulations has more information about [
unsolicited contacts and the National Directory Database
