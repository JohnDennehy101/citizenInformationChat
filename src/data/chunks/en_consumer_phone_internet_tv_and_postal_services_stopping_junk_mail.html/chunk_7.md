##  Rules on cold calling

Phone numbers are listed free of charge in the national telephone directory
and in directory enquiries.

The NDD is a list of telephone numbers publicly available in phone books or
through directory enquiries in Ireland. It includes both landline and mobile
phone numbers. The NDDâ€™s function is to:

  * Hold your listing preferences (whether or not you want to be listed) for telephone directories or directory enquiry services 
  * Hold your preference whether or not you want to be contacted by direct marketing companies 

The ePrivacy Regulations bans companies from cold calling if you have changed
your listing in the NDD to stop such calls to your landline.
