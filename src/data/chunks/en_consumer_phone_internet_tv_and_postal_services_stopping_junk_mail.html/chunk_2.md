##  What is an unsolicited communication?

Junk mail is unsolicited you receive through the post that advertises or
promotes something. Spam is email marketing that you have not requested or do
not want. Cold calling is when a company you have not had any dealings with,
calls you for sales or marketing purposes.

An unsolicited communication means contact that you did not seek or request.
The laws on direct marketing are set out in the [ General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN) and Regulation 13 of the [
ePrivacy Regulations 2011
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/si/336/made/en/print) .

In general, a company is allowed to contact you if:

  * You have given your consent (agreed to it) 
  * You have not changed your direct marketing preference in the National Directory Database (NDD) 

Even if the company has your agreement to be contacted, you can change your
mind and withdraw your consent under the GDPR.

There are steps you can take to prevent junk mail, spam and unwanted phone
calls and texts.
