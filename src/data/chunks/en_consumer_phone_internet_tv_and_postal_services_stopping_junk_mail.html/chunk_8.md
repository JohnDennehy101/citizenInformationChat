###  What about mobile phones?

Companies cannot make cold calls to mobile numbers unless:

  * You give the company consent to call you on your mobile 
  * You have consented to receiving direct marketing calls and this consent has been recorded in the NDD 

Mobile phone numbers are automatically ‘opted out’ on the NDD to receive
direct marketing calls. These rules are set our in the ePrivacy Regulations.
