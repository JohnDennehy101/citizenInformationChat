##  Fees and charges

Many banks and credit unions charge a fee for setting up an overdraft and an
annual fee to continue it.

You pay interest on the amount you owe at any one time, not on the total
overdraft limit available to you. The interest rate on overdrafts is usually
higher than the rate charged on personal loans. The rate can change.
