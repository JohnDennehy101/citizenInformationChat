##  Introduction

You can apply to your bank or credit union [KD1] for an overdraft on your
current account.

When there is no money in your account, an overdraft allows you to continue to
spend up to a certain amount, known as the ‘overdraft limit’.

You have to pay back what you spend from your overdraft, plus interest. The
interest rate on overdrafts is usually higher than on personal loans. You can
reduce the amount of interest you pay by using less than the limit and
repaying the overdraft before it is due.
