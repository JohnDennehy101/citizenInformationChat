###  What if I canâ€™t pay back an overdraft?

Ask the bank or credit union for more time to pay back what you owe. It is
likely to agree to a time extension if you have paid off your debts in the
past.

If you still cannot pay back the overdraft and are getting further into debt,
contact MABS (the [ Money Advice and Budgeting Service ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/debt/mabs-service/) ). MABS will help you work out how
much money you can afford to pay back per month. It will then contact the bank
or credit union for you. MABS will arrange with the bank or credit union that
you will pay back a certain amount every month until the debt is cleared. MABS
offers this service free of charge.
