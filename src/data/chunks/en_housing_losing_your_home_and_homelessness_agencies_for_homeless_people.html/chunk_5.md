##  Accessing social welfare payments

In general, you make any claims for social welfare payments such as [
Jobseeker’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
allowance/) ; for [ illness and disability payments ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/benefits-to-people-who-are-sick-or-have-a-
disability/) ; for [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) and for other [ Supplementary Welfare
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/) payments in the
normal way.

In Dublin, there is a Homeless Persons Unit (HPU) to deal with claims for
Supplementary Welfare Allowance. The unit can also provide information on
other services that may be relevant to your circumstances.
