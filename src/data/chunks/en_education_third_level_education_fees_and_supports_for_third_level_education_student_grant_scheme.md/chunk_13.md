####  Can I be considered ‘independent’, rather than ‘dependent’?

You can only be reclassified from a ‘dependent student’ to an ‘independent
student’ when you:

  * Progress from further education to higher education, or 
  * Have a 3-year break in your studies, or 
  * Are returning as a second-chance student after a 3-year break in your studies.
