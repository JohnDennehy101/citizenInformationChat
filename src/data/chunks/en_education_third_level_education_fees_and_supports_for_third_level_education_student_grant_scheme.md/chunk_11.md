####  If you’re dependent on your parents

If you are **dependent on your parent(s)** , your income (if any) is assessed
together with your parents' income(s). This means you must give details of
your parents’ or legal guardians’ income when filling out your application.
You are dependent on your parents if you:

  * Are under 23 on 1 January of the year you first enter further or higher education 
  * Are over 23 on 1 January of the year you enter or re-enter further or higher education, and you live with your parent(s) or legal guardian 

SUSI makes an allowance of up to €7,925 (previously €6,552) for your earnings
outside of term-time. This is called your ‘holiday earnings’. Outside term
time includes:

  * Christmas holidays 
  * Easter holidays 
  * Summer holidays 

If you get holiday earnings outside these periods, it may also be allowed if
the school or college confirms the exact term-dates in writing.
