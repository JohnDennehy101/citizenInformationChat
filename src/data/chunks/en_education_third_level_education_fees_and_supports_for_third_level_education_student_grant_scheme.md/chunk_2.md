##  What is the Student Grant Scheme?

The Student Grant Scheme is the main financial support scheme for students
studying full-time courses in Ireland and abroad. It is also known as the SUSI
grant because the Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) is the awarding
authority for the Student Grant Scheme.

Student grants are divided into:

  * Maintenance grants 
  * Fee grants 

Maintenance grants help students with their living costs. Fee grants pay
tuition fees for students who do not qualify for the [ Free Fees Scheme
](/en/education/third-level-education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-
education/fees/) . Fee grants can also pay the Student Contribution and the
cost of essential field trips.

If you qualify for the maintenance grant, you also get the fee grant. Some
people only get a fee grant - see ‘How much will I get?’ below.
