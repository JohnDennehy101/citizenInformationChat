####  Second-chance student

A ‘second-chance student’ is someone who:

  * Is aged over 23 
  * Did not successfully complete an earlier course 
  * Is returning to do an approved course (at PLC, undergraduate or post-graduate level) after a full break in studies of at least 3 years 

You may do a course during this 3-year break and still qualify as a second-
chance student if the course:

  * Was below undergraduate level 
  * Meets the progression rules
