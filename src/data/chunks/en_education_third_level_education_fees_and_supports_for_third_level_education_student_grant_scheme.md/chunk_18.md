###  5\. Progression

In general, you do not get a grant for repeating a year or attending a course
at a level that does not represent progression from your previous studies.
However, you may get a student grant for the following:

  * You attended a further or higher education course and left before it finished. In this case, you may get a portion of a student grant once you have completed the repeat period of study. For example, you did 3 months of a level 7 course and left. You are now starting a new level 7 course. You will not get a student grant for the first 3 months of your new course. 
  * You are repeating a year due to [ exceptional circumstances ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/e5add-2023-student-grant-scheme-guidelines-for-an-awarding-authority/)
  * You are starting a PLC course as part of the [ Tertiary Education Programme ](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/tertiary-education-programme/) . The course must be leading to a qualification at a higher level than your previous further education or undergraduate qualification. If you previously started an undergraduate qualification and are not a _second-chance student_ , you may have to complete the repeat period of study before getting a student grant. 
  * You are a _second-chance student_ â€“ see below.
