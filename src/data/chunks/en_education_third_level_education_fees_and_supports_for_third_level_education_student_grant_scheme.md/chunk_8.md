###  2\. Residence condition

You must have been resident in the State for 3 of the previous 5 years to
qualify for a maintenance grant. However, if you are temporarily resident
elsewhere in the EU in order to pursue a course of study for a recognised
qualification, and you were resident in the State for 3 of the 5 years before
starting that course, you meet this requirement.

If you fulfil all the criteria for a maintenance grant except for the
residence condition, you may still qualify for a fee grant or a postgraduate
fee contribution as a [ tuition student ](https://www.susi.ie/eligibility-
criteria/residency-criteria/) .
