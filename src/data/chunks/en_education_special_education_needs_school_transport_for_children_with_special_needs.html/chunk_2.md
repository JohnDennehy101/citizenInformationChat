Bus Éireann (the State public transport operator) operates the school
transport service on behalf of the Department. The school transport service
may not be available in all areas. Where the transport cannot be provided, you
may be eligible for a Special Transport Grant to help with the cost of making
private transport arrangements.

**If your school transport service has not started**

If you have a school transport ticket and your service has not started, you
may get an Exceptional No Service Interim Grant. The grant is to help with the
cost of transport to school while you are waiting for your school transport to
start.

The grant is based on the number of days your child attends school from the
date the service was due to start up to the date the service actually starts.
It will be paid after your school transport service starts and at the same
rate as the Special Transport Grant – see ‘Rates’ below.

The Department will contact you directly about the grant.
