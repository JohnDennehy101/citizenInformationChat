###  Record of the interview

A record must be kept of your interview either by the Garda conducting it or
by another Garda who is present. The record must include details of the time
the interview began and ended, any breaks in it, the place of the interview
and the names and ranks of the Garda√≠ present. If the interview is not
electronically recorded, the record will be kept in the Garda's notebook.
