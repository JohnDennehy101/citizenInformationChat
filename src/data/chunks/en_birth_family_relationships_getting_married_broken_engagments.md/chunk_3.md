##  Gifts between an engaged couple

If an engaged couple exchanges gifts, including an engagement ring, there's a
presumption that these gifts will be returned if one of them asks for them
back in the event of the engagement ending.

However, if the person that gives the gift dies, it is presumed any gifts were
given without any conditions. In this case, the surviving fianc√©(e) can keep
the gifts.

You can contest either of these presumptions in court if there is evidence to
the contrary.

You may be able to challenge either of these presumptions in court by
presenting evidence that contradicts them.
