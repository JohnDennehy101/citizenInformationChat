##  Property of engaged couples

When a couple (whose engagement has ended) disagrees about how any property is
divided, it is treated in the same way as disputes between a married couple
who are separating or divorcing.

This only applies to property in which either or both of them had a beneficial
interest while they were engaged. It does not apply to property acquired after
the engagement ended.
