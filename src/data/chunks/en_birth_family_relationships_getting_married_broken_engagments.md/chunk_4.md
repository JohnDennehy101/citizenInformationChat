##  Gifts from a third party (such as a family member or friend)

If someone gives an engaged couple (or one of the couple) a wedding gift, it
is presumed that the couple are joint owners of the gift. This can be
challenged in court if there is evidence to the contrary.

It is also presumed that the gift will be returned (if requested), if the
engagement ends and the marriage does not take place for any reason. This
includes the death of one of the engaged couple.

If a third party gives a substantial benefit (not a wedding gift) to one of
the couple as a result of the engagement, the third party can take legal
action if the engagement ends. For example, if a relative carries out or pays
for substantial work to improve a property which the couple had planned to use
as their family home, the relative can apply to the courts for compensation.
