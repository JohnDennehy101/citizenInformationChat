##  Wedding preparation expenses

If an engagement ends, and one person has spent a lot of money preparing for
the wedding (without getting any benefit from it), that person can ask the
courts for compensation from their former fianc√©(e).

Examples of expenses might include:

  * Booking the wedding reception 
  * Booking the honeymoon 
  * Hiring a photographer or videographer 

If somebody else (for example, a family member or friend) has spent a lot of
money preparing for the wedding on behalf of one of the couple (and has not
benefited), they may also apply to the courts for compensation.
