##  Introduction

Irish citizens do not have an automatic entitlement to bring [ family members
who are not nationals ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-
residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-of-family-members#l65f35) of the [
European Economic Area (EEA) ](https://www.efta.int/eea) , EU, UK or
Switzerland to live in Ireland. If you are returning to Ireland with your non-
EEA spouse or non-EEA civil partner, your spouse or civil partner must get
permission from the Irish Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) to live with you
in Ireland.

If your spouse or civil partner is a citizen of Ukraine, they **do not need a
visa or preclearance** . You can read [ coming to Ireland from Ukraine
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-
ireland/coming-to-ireland-from-ukraine/) for more information.

This page is a step-by-step guide to the immigration process for your non-EEA
spouse or civil partner. We also have a [ step by step guide if you are
returning with your non-EEA de-facto partner ](/en/returning-to-
ireland/residency-and-citizenship/returning-to-ireland-with-your-de-facto-
partner/) .

You can no longer register a civil partnership in Ireland. Civil partnerships
registered abroad after 16 May 2016 are not recognised as civil partnerships
in Ireland. Under the [ Marriage Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/35/enacted/en/html) , same-sex
couples can get married in Ireland. Same-sex marriages which were registered
abroad before the Marriage Act 2015 are also recognised in Ireland.
