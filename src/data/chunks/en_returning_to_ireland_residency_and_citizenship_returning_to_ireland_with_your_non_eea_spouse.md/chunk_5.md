####  How do I apply for my children?

Children (under the age of 18) apply for a visa in a similar way to adults
using the online form. Their birth certificate must be submitted with the
application. ISD has information on [ visa applications for children aged
under 18 ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-
