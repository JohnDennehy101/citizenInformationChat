##  Step 5: After residency permission is granted

If your spouse or civil partner is given permission to live with you in
Ireland, they will get Stamp 4 in their passport. Stamp 4 allows them to live
and work in Ireland for the length of time stated on the stamp.

Your spouse or civil partner will also be issued with a registration
certificate called an [ Irish Residence Permit (IRP)
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-
permission/information-on-registering/irish-residence-permit/) . This is a
credit-card sized plastic card that displays basic information about the card
holder.

After permission is granted, your non-EEA spouse or civil partner must inform
ISD of any change of address within 2 days of moving. Also, if their family
circumstances change (for example, if your relationship breaks down) they must
tell ISD.

**Make a note of when the residency permit must be renewed**

Your spouse or civil partnerâ€™s [ Stamp 4 permission will usually be valid for
3 years ](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP07000024) . In order to stay
in Ireland, your spouse or civil partner will need to [ renew this permission
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/how-
to-renew-your-current-permission/) before it expires.
