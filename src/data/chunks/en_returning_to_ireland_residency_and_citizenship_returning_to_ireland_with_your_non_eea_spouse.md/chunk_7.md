##  Step 3: Prepare for border control

All citizens of non-EEA countries, whether they need a visa or not, must go
through border control at point of entry (which is usually the airport) when
they arrive in Ireland. At border control an immigration officer examines your
spouse’s or civil partner’s documents. The immigration officer will then
decide if your spouse or civil partner is allowed to enter the country.

Your spouse or civil partner should tell the immigration officer that they
plan to apply for residency in Ireland, based on their relationship with you.

At border control, your spouse or civil partner will be asked for the
following documents at a minimum:

  * Valid passport 
  * D Visa (if they are from a visa-required country) 
  * Marriage or civil partnership certificate 

If your spouse or civil partner is allowed to enter Ireland, the immigration
officer will place a landing stamp in their passport. The landing stamp gives
them permission to stay in Ireland up to the date indicated or to a maximum of
3 months.
