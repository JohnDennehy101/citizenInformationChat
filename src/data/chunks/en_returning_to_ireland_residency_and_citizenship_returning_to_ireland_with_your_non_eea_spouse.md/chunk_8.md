##  Step 4: Register with immigration and apply for residency

Your spouse or civil partner must be **in Ireland** before they can register
with immigration authorities and apply for residency permission. Residency
permission allows your non-EEA spouse or civil partner to live with you in
Ireland.

Your spouse or civil partner must register with the immigration authorities
within 90 days of their arrival in Ireland or within the time specified on the
landing stamp (which may be for less than 90 days) provided at border control.
