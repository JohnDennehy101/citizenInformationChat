###  Extra benefits

You can keep any extra (or _secondary_ benefits) that you were getting with
your JB or JBSE provided you continue to satisfy the conditions. For example,
[ a medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/)
and [ Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/back-to-school-clothing-and-footwear-allowance/)
