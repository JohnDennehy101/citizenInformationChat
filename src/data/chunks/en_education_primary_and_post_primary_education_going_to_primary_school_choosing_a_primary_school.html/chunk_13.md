##  Finding a school

To find a school, you can search primary schools by type and area using the
Department of Education’s [ Find a School ](https://www.education.ie/en/Find-
a-School/) tool.

You can filter your search results by ethos, language of instruction, and
gender. You will see a map showing schools that meet your selection.

Most schools have a website with information about their ethos, policies,
curriculum, and extra-curricular activities on offer. You can also contact a
school directly for more information.
