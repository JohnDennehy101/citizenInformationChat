##  Recouping election costs

Candidates can qualify for recoupment (repayment) of their election expenses
(up to a maximum of €8,700 at a Dáil election), if they:

  * Are elected 
  * Are not elected, but their total number of votes **exceeds** one quarter of the quota 

There are extra count rules to give candidates every chance of reaching this
vote threshold.

At a bye-election, the threshold is calculated differently to ensure that the
minimum number of votes needed to qualify for recoupment of election expenses
at a general election and at a [ bye-election ](/en/government-in-
ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/by-
elections-in-ireland/) in the same constituency is broadly comparable.
