##  How are votes counted in a PR election?

When polling is over, all the ballot boxes are taken to a central counting
place for each constituency. The count starts at 9am on the day after polling
day. Each ballot box is opened separately and the ballot papers in each box
are counted.

The total number is compared with the total number of ballot papers issued for
that box - this is done to check that ballot papers have not been put into or
taken out of the box since the poll closed.

The ballot papers are then sorted into piles of ballot papers for each
candidate.

The ballot papers are counted and sorted, and spoiled papers are rejected.

The **total valid poll** is the total number of votes minus the number of
spoiled papers.

The count then takes place over a number of rounds. As candidates are elected
or eliminated, the second, third (or lower) preference votes on that
candidateâ€™s ballot paper are counted.

Counting continues until all the seats have been filled.
