##  Voting in a PR election

At the polling station on election day, you will be given a stamped ballot
paper. The returning officer may ask to see some identification or a polling
card.

You cast your vote in a private space.

The election candidates will be listed alphabetically alongside their picture,
the name of their party (if they belong to a political party) and their party
emblem (in some cases). You vote by placing the number of your choice next to
the candidate or candidates that you have chosen.

You can vote for as many or as few of the candidates as you wish.

If you want to vote for one candidate only, you should mark the number “1” in
the box next to the candidate’s name. You should **not** tick or mark the box
with an X.

Pencils will be provided, but you can bring your own pen or pencil if you
wish.

When you have voted you should fold your ballot paper so your vote is not
visible and put the folded ballot paper into the ballot box.

If you make a mistake on your ballot paper, the returning officer may give you
another ballot paper. This is at the discretion of the returning officer. If
you have already posted your ballot in the ballot box, the returning officer
cannot give you another ballot paper.
