##  What happens to surplus votes?

If a candidate receives **more than the quota** , their _surplus_ ballot
papers are transferred to the remaining candidates.

The surplus is transferred in proportion to how many second (or lower)
preferences the other candidates received in the elected candidateâ€™s vote. If
the second preference candidate on any ballot is either already elected or has
been eliminated, then the third preference is used, and so on.

If a candidate is elected at the first count, then all their votes are used to
calculate the proportion of surplus that will be given to each candidate.

Where a candidate reaches the quota **after the first count** , only the
ballot papers that brought them over the quota are examined (the votes that
were transferred from the previous count).

If 2 or more candidates are elected at the same time, then the surplus of the
candidate with the largest vote is distributed first.
