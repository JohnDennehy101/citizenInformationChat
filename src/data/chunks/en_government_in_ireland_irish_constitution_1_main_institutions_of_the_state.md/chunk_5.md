##  The Executive

[ Article 28 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part5) of the
Constitution gives executive power to [ the Government ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/government-of-ireland/) .

Executive power includes the power to execute or carry out laws with the
assistance of the [ civil service ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/national-government/the-civil-service/) , police force and military. The
head of Government is the Taoiseach, who is nominated by the [ Dáil
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) . The
Taoiseach nominates a deputy (the Tánaiste) and a cabinet of ministers to take
responsibility for the [ Departments of Government ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/departments-of-state/) .

The Government is usually formed by the largest party in the Dáil after a [
general election ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-
elections-and-referendums/the-general-election/) . A Government formed from
two or more parties is called a [ coalition government ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/government-of-ireland/) .

The Government must have at least 7 members (which must include the Taoiseach,
the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance), and at most 15 members. A maximum
of 2 senators can be appointed as Ministers.

The Government is answerable to [ Dáil Éireann ](/en/government-in-
ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) , and will not survive without
the support of the majority of TDs.
