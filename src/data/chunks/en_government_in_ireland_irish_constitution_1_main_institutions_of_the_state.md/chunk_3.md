##  Separation of powers

The Irish Constitution says that all of the power of the State comes from the
Irish people.

It also says that that the power to govern is divided between the Legislature,
the Executive and the Judiciary.

The Legislature has law-making power. Only the [ Oireachtas
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/) (the national parliament), with the [ President
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/president-introduction-
to-the-president-of-ireland/) as its head, can make laws in Ireland. See ‘The
Legislature' below.

The Executive has the power to enforce the law, run the departments of the
State and set the agenda of the Oireachtas. The [ Government ](/en/government-
in-ireland/how-government-works/national-government/government-of-ireland/) ,
led by the Taoiseach, has the executive power of the State. See ‘The
Executive’ below.

The Judiciary has the power to interpret the law. The Irish [ courts system
](http://www.courts.ie/) has this power, which includes the power to decide if
a piece of legislation or law is _unconstitutional_ . See ‘The Judiciary’
below.

The Constitution sets out how these state powers should work, and puts in
place checks and balances to prevent institutions from having too much power.
