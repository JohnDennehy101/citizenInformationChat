##  The Judiciary

The judicial power is the power to interpret and apply the law to disputes and
conflicts that arise between the State and the individual and disputes and
conflicts that arise between individuals. Articles [ 34 to 37
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part11) of the Constitution
give this power to the [ courts ](/en/justice/courts-system/courts/) .

Under [ Article 35 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part11)
, judges of the courts are independent of the Government and can only be
removed through a resolution of both houses of the Oireachtas for misbehaviour
or incapacity.

Judges are appointed by the [ President ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-
the-oireachtas/president-introduction-to-the-president-of-ireland/) , who acts
on the advice of the Government. The [ Judicial Appointments Advisory Board

bench.
