##  Introduction

Ireland is a _constitutional republic_ , which means that the fundamental
rules that determine how the State behaves, how laws are made, and how power
should be used are set out in a written constitution.

It also means that the people of Ireland elect who they want to represent
them, govern them, and make laws on their behalf.

The [ Irish Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) establishes and describes the main
institutions of the State. The power to run the State is divided into 3
separate branches:

  * The _Legislature_ (or _legislative branch_ ) 
  * The _Executive_ (or _executive branch_ ) 
  * The _Judiciary_ (or _judicial branch_ ) 

The Constitution tries to keep these powers separate to guarantee that there
is not too much power in the hands of one institution of the State.
