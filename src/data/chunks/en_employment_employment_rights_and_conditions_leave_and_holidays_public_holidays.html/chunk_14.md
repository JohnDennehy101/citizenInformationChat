##  If you are on lay-off, short-time work, or lose your job

During lay off or short-time working, you still are employed by your employer
and your contract of employment remains in force. This means that you are
entitled to benefit for any public holidays that occur during the first 13
weeks of lay off.

Part-time employees must have worked at least 40 hours in the 5 weeks before
the public holiday.
