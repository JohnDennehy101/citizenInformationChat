###  **If you are getting a Jobseeker's Allowance or Supplementary Welfare
Allowance**

If you are aged 25 or over and getting Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) or
Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA), your payment is suspended, but you will
get an FET training allowance of the same amount.

If you are getting a reduced age-related Jobseeker's Allowance your payment is
suspended, but you will get a FET training allowance of €232. Any means that
were deducted from your Jobseeker’s Allowance will also be deducted from your
FET training allowance. This also applies to people getting a reduced age-
related basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance.

However, if you are aged under 18 and attending a Community Training Centre,
you will continue to get an age-related training allowance – see ’Weekly FET
training allowance rates’ below.

If your entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance or Supplementary Welfare
Allowance stops during the FET course, your FET training allowance will stop.
