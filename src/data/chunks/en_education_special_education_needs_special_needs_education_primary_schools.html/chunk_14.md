####  **Autism**

Children on the autistic spectrum may avail of special needs education in the
same way as other children with special needs. There are also specific
provisions for them.

There are a number of special classes for children with autism, which are
attached to special and mainstream schools, as well as several special classes
for children with Asperger’s Syndrome. There are early intervention classes
(attached to some primary schools) for children of pre-school age who are on
the autistic spectrum.

The [ Home Tuition Scheme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/d15f58-home-
tuition/) funds home programmes for pre-school children on the autistic
spectrum who need early educational intervention. The grant aid is for 10
hours' home tuition a week for children aged 2½ to 3 and 20 hours a week for
children aged 3. The funding is not provided if there is a place in school or
early education available to the child.

There are also a number of stand-alone facilities providing an applied
behavioural analysis (ABA) specific methodology.
