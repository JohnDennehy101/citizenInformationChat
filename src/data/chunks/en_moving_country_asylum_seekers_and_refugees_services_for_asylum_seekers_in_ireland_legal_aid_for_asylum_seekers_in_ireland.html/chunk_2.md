##  What legal services are available to asylum seekers?

[ The Legal Aid Board ](http://www.legalaidboard.ie/) provides confidential
and independent [ legal services to people applying for asylum in Ireland
](http://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/Our-Services/Legal-Aid-Services/Services-for-
international-protection-applicants/Services/General-Information/Legal-
Services.html) . It can help you with your application for international
protection (covering both refugee status and subsidiary protection) to the
International Protection Office and appeals to the International Protection
Appeals Tribunal.

It can **not** assist you with a judicial review of how the decision on your
application was made, but you might be able to get [ civil legal aid
](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-advice/civil-legal-advice-and-legal-aid/) for that
separately.

The [ Irish Refugee Council Independent Law Centre
](https://www.irishrefugeecouncil.ie/Listing/Category/law-centre) also
provides early legal advice and representation to people in the early stages
of the asylum process.
