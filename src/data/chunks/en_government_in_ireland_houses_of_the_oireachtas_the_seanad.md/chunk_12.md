###  **Nominations by the Taoiseach**

The [ Taoiseach ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/national-
government/government-of-ireland/) of a new DÃ¡il Eireann nominates 11 members
of the Seanad. The Taoiseach has the final say on who is nominated, although
in the case of a coalition Government it is usual for the Taoiseach to
nominate some candidates on the advice of the junior coalition partner.

Under the Constitution, 2 Senators may become members of the Government. They
are nominated by the Taoiseach.
