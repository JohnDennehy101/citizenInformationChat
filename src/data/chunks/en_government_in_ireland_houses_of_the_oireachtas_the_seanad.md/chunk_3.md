##  What does the Seanad do?

The main function of Seanad Éireann is in relation to [ legislation
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/legislation/) . A Bill
may start life in either the [ Dáil ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/dail-eireann/) (the Lower House of the Oireachtas) or the Seanad.

The Seanad may propose amendments, reject or pass a Bill. The Dáil has the
power to over-ride the Seanad's rejection of a Bill.

Bills that will result in government spending (known as money bills) must come
from the Dáil and cannot be amended in the Seanad.

The Seanad has other functions, which it shares with the Dáil, such as:

  * The removal from office of the [ President ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/president-introduction-to-the-president-of-ireland/) or a judge of the [ Supreme Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/) , [ Court of Appeal ](/en/justice/courts-system/court-of-appeal/) or [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/)
  * Declaring a state of emergency 
  * Annulling statutory instruments
