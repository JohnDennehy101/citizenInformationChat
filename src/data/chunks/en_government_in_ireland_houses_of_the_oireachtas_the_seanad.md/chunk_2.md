Oireachtas (Ireland’s national Parliament) and is located in Dublin. The lower
house of the Oireachtas is [ the Dáil ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-
the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) .

The Seanad is composed of 60 members known as Senators. Eleven of the Senators
are nominated by the Taoiseach and 49 are elected in Seanad elections.

One Senator takes the role of _Cathaoirleach_ (Speaker/Chairperson). The
Cathaoirleach chairs proceedings in the House and must act impartially.

Senators are not officially separated into political parties. However, they
usually divide into groups supporting and opposing [ Government
