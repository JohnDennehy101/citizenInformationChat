###  Motoring

A car scrappage scheme is being introduced with effect from 1 January 2010, to
run until 31 December 2010. VRT relief of up to €1,500 will be provided where
a car of 10 years or older is scrapped in accordance with certain criteria and
a new car of emissions bands A or B (CO2 emissions of 140g/km or less) is
purchased.

The car being scrapped:

  * Must have been registered in the State in the name of the purchaser of the new car for at least 18 months previous to the date of scrappage 
  * Must be 10 years old or more from the date of first registration 
  * Must be scrapped after 9 December 2009 
  * Must be scrapped within 60 days of the date of the new car being registered, or have been scrapped within the previous 60 days of the date of the new car being registered, provided the date of scrappage is after 9 December 2009 
  * Must have a valid NCT certificate of roadworthiness, or one that has expired no more than 90 days prior to issue of the Certificate of Destruction; or documentation to indicate that it has been presented for and failed an NCT roadworthiness test in the previous 6 months 
  * Must have been insured for use on the road for at least 12 months in the 18 months prior to the issue of the Certificate of Destruction 

Being ‘scrapped’ means that the old car has been taken to an official End of
Life Vehicles (ELV) authorised treatment facility and a Certificate of
Destruction is issued by the facility in respect of the car.

Further detailed information on the operation of the scheme will be posted on
the Revenue website in the coming days.

The existing VRT exemption for series production electric vehicles and the VRT
relief for series production plug-in hybrid electric vehicles of up to €2,500,
which is due to expire on 31 December 2010, is being extended for two years
until 31 December 2012. There will be a grant for half the cost of the
batteries for the first 6,000 electric cars on Irish roads.

A carbon tax at a rate of €15 per tonne is being introduced on fossil fuels.
The tax will apply to petrol and auto-diesel with effect from midnight, 9
December 2009.
