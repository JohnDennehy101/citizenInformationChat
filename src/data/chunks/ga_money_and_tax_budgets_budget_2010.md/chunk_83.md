###  Pensions

A new single scheme will be introduced for all new entrants to the public
service from 2010 onwards. Main provisions include:

  * Raising of the minimum public service pension age from 65 to 66 years initially, and then to be linked with the State Pension age 
  * Maximum retirement age of 70 years 
  * Pensions to be based on “career average” earnings rather than final salary 

Legislation will be introduced early in 2010 to give effect to these measures.

The Government will consider using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the basis
for post-retirement increases for both existing and future pensioners.

For existing public servants retiring after 2010, the Minister may bring
forward further proposals as part of the legislation introducing the single
new scheme.

In developing the new scheme the Government will be considering:

  * Employee pension contribution - the rate of employee pension contribution remains at 6.5% but may apply to all pensionable pay 
  * Pension accrual rate applying to pensionable pay taking account of entitlement to a State Pension 
  * Some groups, such as Gardaí, Defence Forces, prison officers and firefighters will retain early retirement ages but other special terms, such as added years, will be generally discontinued 

These terms to apply to the President, Oireachtas members, the judiciary and
the Attorney General.

Any retirements in 2010 will be on existing pay terms before the reductions
announced in this Budget.
