###  PRSI Contributions

From 2011 a new Universal Social Contribution will replace employee PRSI, the
health levy and the income levy. It will be paid by everyone at a low rate on
a wide base as a collective contribution to public services. (Note, 8 December
2010: a Universal Social Charge will be introduced from 1 January 2011 which
replaces the income levy and the health levy only.)
