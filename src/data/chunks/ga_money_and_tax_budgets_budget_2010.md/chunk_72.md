###  Additional expenditure measures

The following measures are being provided for the implementation of
commitments under the Renewed Programme for Government.

  * €12m will be allocated to provide 500 extra teachers over the next three years. This allocation will allow for the employment of an extra 200 teachers starting in early 2010 and a further 150 teachers starting in September 2010. 
  * €14m will be allocated to provide extra teachers from September 2010 for the 2010/11 school year to meet demographic pressures and to ensure no further increase in the pupil-teacher ratio. This allocation will fund 600 posts in primary schools and 330 posts in post-primary schools. 
  * €19m will be provided to maintain school capitation grants at current levels and to take account of increased pupil numbers. This allocation will also enable extra funding to be allocated to schools for school books and to support curricular activities. 
  * The allocation for the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) will be increased by €7.5m to meet additional expenditure on allowances due to the change in profile of applicants for the scheme. 
  * An extra allocation of €3m will be provided for the promotion of Gaeilge in schools as part of the new 20-year Strategy for the Irish Language. 
  * The provision for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) will be increased to provide for the rise in psychologists by 28 to 210. This will allow NEPS psychologists to provide direct service to every first and second level school and an enhancement of service to special schools and units.
