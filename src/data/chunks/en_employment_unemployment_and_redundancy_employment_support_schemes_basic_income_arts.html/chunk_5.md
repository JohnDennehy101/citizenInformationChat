The payment is taxable, but the amount of tax paid depends on your individual
circumstances.

You need to [ register with Revenue ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-
assessment-and-self-employment/guide-to-self-assessment/index.aspx) as self-
employed and pay Schedule D income tax, where appropriate, on the BIA payment.
Income from the pilot will be liable for USC and Class S PRSI.

You are entitled to earn additional income, which would also be reckonable for
the purposes of income tax.
