##  Registered Employment Agreements

A Registered Employment Agreement (REA) is a _collective agreement_ between a
trade union and an employer. It can also be an agreement between multiple
unions and multiple employers (or an employersâ€™ organisation). The agreement
is reached through _collective bargaining_ , which means each side voluntarily
engages in the negotiations.

An REA sets out the pay and employment conditions of the workers covered in
the agreement.

Once an REA is registered with the Labour Court, it becomes binding
(compulsory) for the parties involved (for example, the worker, employer and
trade union).

All REAs must include a disputes procedure, which all parties to the agreement
must keep to. You can refer any breaches of an REA to the [ Workplace
Relations Commission
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
.

The law on REAs is set out in the [ Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2015/act/27/revised/en/html) .

The Labour Court keeps a [ register of employment agreements
](https://www.labourcourt.ie/en/publications/registers/) , as required by [
Section 8
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2015/act/27/revised/en/html#SEC8) of
the Act.
