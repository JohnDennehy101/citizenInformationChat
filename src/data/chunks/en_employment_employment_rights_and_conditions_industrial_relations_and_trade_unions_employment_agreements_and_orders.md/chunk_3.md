##  Employment Regulation Orders

An [ Employment Regulation Order (ERO)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/hours-and-
wages/employment%20regulation%20orders/) sets the minimum rates of pay and
conditions of employment for workers in a particular sector.

There are currently 3 EROs in operation, including for the:

  * [ Contract cleaning sector ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2024/si/255/made/en/print) (effective since 1 June 2024) 
  * [ Security sector ](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/legislation/legislation-files/si-no-319-of-2024.pdf) (effective since 1 July 2024) 
  * [ Early learning and childcare sector ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2024/si/296/made/en/print) (effective since 24 June 2024) 

Employers must pay the wage rates and provide the employment conditions set
out in the ERO. They cannot give less favourable wages or conditions than
those in the ERO.

If your employment conditions are covered by an ERO, there must be a notice on
display in the workplace, explaining the terms of the ERO.

You can report any breaches of an ERO to the [ Workplace Relations Commission
(WRC)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
