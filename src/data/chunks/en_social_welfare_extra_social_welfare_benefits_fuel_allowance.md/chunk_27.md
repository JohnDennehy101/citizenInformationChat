###  **Telephone Support Allowance**

If you are getting Fuel Allowance as well as the [ Living Alone Increase
](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/living-alone-allowance/) ,
you will also get a [ Telephone Support Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/extra-
social-welfare-benefits/telephone-support-allowance/) of â‚¬2.50 per week. This
is paid automatically with your main social welfare payment, so you do not
have to apply for it.
