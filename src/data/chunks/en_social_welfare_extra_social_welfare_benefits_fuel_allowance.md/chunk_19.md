###  Renting a room in your home

If you are [ renting out a room in your home ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/4bf45-minister-humphreys-announces-measures-to-remove-barriers-facing-
social-welfare-customers-seeking-to-take-in-tenants/) , you can have an income
from rent of up to €269.23 a week (€14,000 per year) without affecting your
Fuel Allowance. The person renting the room in your home must use the room for
a minimum of 28 consecutive days and cannot be an employee of yours or an
immediate family member.

The [ Accommodation Recognition Payment ](/en/moving-country/ukrainian-
refugees-in-ireland/accommodation-recognition-payment/) (for hosting people
from Ukraine) is not taken into account in the means test.

Since 1 February 2024, someone renting a room from you, or for whom you get
the Accommodation Recognition Payment, does **not** have to:

  * Get a qualifying social welfare payment, nor 
  * Qualify for Fuel Allowance in their own right.
