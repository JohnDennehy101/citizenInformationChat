##  Fuel Allowance income limit for people under 70

If you are under 70, you must be getting a qualifying payment to apply for
Fuel Allowance (see ‘Qualifying social welfare payments and pensions above’).

To qualify for Fuel Allowance, your means must be less than the maximum [
State Pension (Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-
contributory/) , including any increases you could get for dependents or
living alone, plus an additional €200. This is called the ‘assessable income
limit’.

For example, the maximum [ State Pension (Contributory)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) for a single
person aged 66 is €277.30. You then add €200 to €277.30, which gives a total
weekly income limit of €477.30.

See the table below for examples of weekly assessable income limits.

**Household type** |  **Assessable income limit (per week)**  
---|---  
Single person under 70  |  €477.30   
Couple (where qualified adult is under 66)  |  €662.00   
Couple (where qualified adult is 66 or over, but under 70)  |  €725.90
