###  If more than one person in a household qualifies

Only one Fuel Allowance payment is paid to a household.

If more than one person in the household is **getting a social assistance
payment** , you can decide who applies for Fuel Allowance.

If someone in the household is **getting a qualifying social insurance
payment** , such as State Pension (Contributory) or Invalidity Pension, they
should apply first (so a means test can be carried out on their income).
Another qualifying person in the household can also apply for Fuel Allowance,
but they must include information about the person getting a social insurance
payment.

If someone in the household is **70 or over** , they should apply.
