####  Jobseeker’s Allowance

You qualify if you have been getting [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) for more than 312 days (over
12 months - it is paid on a 6-day week basis so 12 months’ payment is reached
after day 312). Days on Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) and PUP can count towards the
312 days, if your JB or PUP was immediately before your JA claim.

You can keep your Fuel Allowance if you move to Jobseeker’s Allowance from One
Parent Family Payment, Carer’s Allowance or Jobseeker’s Transitional payment.
