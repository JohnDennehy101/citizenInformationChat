##  Introduction

If you are pregnant, antenatal classes can help you to prepare for [ labour
](https://www2.hse.ie/labour-and-birth/) , the birth of your baby, and
becoming a parent. Some classes also include practical advice on how to care
for your baby after their arrival, as well as how to look after you and your
relationship with your partner.

Many maternity hospitals and health centres offer antenatal classes for free,
though you can also register for private classes if you wish. You should book
your preferred classes as early as possible as these can fill up fast.

If you are employed, you may be entitled to take paid time off work to attend
antenatal classes. You should give your employer at least 2 weeksâ€™ notice (in
writing) before the classes begin. See 'Time off work and antenatal classes'
below.
