##  Time off work and antenatal classes

If you are employed, [ you are entitled to take paid time off work to attend
one set of antenatal classes (except for the last 3 classes in a set)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/28/enacted/en/html) . For
example, if this is your first pregnancy in employment and you are attending a
set of 8 classes, you are only entitled to be paid while attending 5 of those
classes. The last 3 classes would normally occur after your maternity leave
has started.

You do not have the right to paid time off work to attend antenatal classes
each time you are pregnant and in employment. The entitlement covers one set
of classes (for one pregnancy) only.

However, if you are unable to attend some antenatal classes due to reasons
beyond your control (such as premature birth, illness, miscarriage or
stillbirth), you can carry over your entitlement to your subsequent
pregnancies. This means you can take paid time off work to attend any untaken
classes (except the last 3 in a set).

Expectant fathers have [ a once-off right to paid time off work to attend the
2 antenatal classes immediately prior to the birth
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/si/0653.html) .

In order to take this paid time off work, you must notify your employer in
writing at least 2 weeks before classes begin. You should outline the dates
and times of the classes, as your employer has the right to request this.

For more information on your entitlement to take paid time off work to attend
antenatal classes (as well as general information on employment rights)
