##  Charges to clients by barristers and solicitors

When you appoint a solicitor, before the case starts they should give you a
detailed estimate of the costs they expect you will need to pay. This forms
part of your contract with them.

The way [ solicitors
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) and [
barristers
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) should
charge you is set out in the [ Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 (Part 10)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/65/section/138/enacted/en/html%22%20/l%20%22part10)
.

If a barrister is engaged, they must provide a similarly detailed estimate to
your solicitor, which is then passed to you. Alternatively, if possible, the
client and the lawyers can agree the amount or amounts to be paid.
