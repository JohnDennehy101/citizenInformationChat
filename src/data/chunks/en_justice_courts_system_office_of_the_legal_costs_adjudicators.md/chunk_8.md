##  Complaints about excessive charges by lawyers

Other than deciding if the costs charged in the legal dispute are fair, the
Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators does not have any regulatory or
investigative powers for complaints about excessive charges by lawyers.

If you have a complaint about excessive charges, you should refer the matter
to the [ Legal Services Regulatory Authority
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/legal-services-
regulatory-authority/) (LSRA). If the LSRA finds the charges are grossly
excessive, such charges will be treated as professional misconduct.
