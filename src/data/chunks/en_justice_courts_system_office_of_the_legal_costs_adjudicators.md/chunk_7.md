Costs and must contain:

  * A summary of the legal services they provided 
  * Details of all the charges that were incurred and the nature of these charges 
  * The amount of VAT charged 
  * The amount of time spent on a legal matter if costs are calculated based on time 
  * The financial outcome of the case, i.e. any damages or other money recovered or that should be paid to you 
  * If any costs have been paid or must be paid by another party 

The Bill of Costs must be provided with an explanation in writing of how any
aspect of the Bill of Costs can be challenged by a client.
