###  **2\. Legal practitioner and client costs**

These are the costs which have been reasonably incurred, but may not have been
absolutely necessary, and are not recoverable under party and party costs.
Excessive charges are not recoverable.

A court must make a court order for legal practitioner and client costs.
Otherwise, costs will be adjudicated on a party and party cost basis.
