##  Finding an interpreter

The job candidate, employee, or advocate must find a qualified interpreter,
lip-speaker, or communication support worker.

Providers must be either:

  * Registered as an Irish Sign Language interpreter with the Register of Irish Sign Language Interpreters ( [ risli.ie ](https://www.risli.ie/) ) 
  * Registered with a recognised interpreter service in Ireland 

Providers must also be tax-compliant and provide a Tax Clearance Certificate
(TCC) or a Tax Clearance Access Number (TCAN). Make sure the interpreter
understands these requirements before you hire them.

If you do not already have an interpreter, the [ Sign Language Interpreting
Service ](http://slis.ie/) can help you find a professional interpreter.
