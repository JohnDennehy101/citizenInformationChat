##  The European Central Bank (ECB)

The [ European Central Bank
](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) (ECB) is the central bank
for the euro area and acts independently from the EU. The ECB has a number of
important functions:

  * It sets interest rates for the euro area 
  * It manages the euro areaâ€™s foreign currency reserves 
  * It watches over central banks and payment systems in the euro area to make sure that they are working properly and fairly 
  * It authorises the production of euro banknotes in euro area countries 
  * It acts to keep prices from going up to sharply 

The ECB is the ultimate banking supervisor for all banks in the euro area and
is directly responsible for supervising the largest banking groups (117 in
total). Other banks are supervised by their national central banks in close
cooperation with the ECB.

The ECB and the central banks of the countries in the EU make up the European
System of Central Banks (ESCB).

The ECB and the central banks of the countries in the euro area make up the
Eurosystem.
