##  Euro summits

Euro summits are held at least twice a year and include:

  * The heads of state or government of all the euro area countries 
  * The president of the Euro Summit 
  * President of the European Commission 

The purpose of the summits is to decide on the strategic economic direction of
the euro area, and to help euro area countries to co-ordinate their economic
policies.

The President of the Euro Summits is elected at the same time as the President
of the [ European Council ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-
institutions/european-council/) . Since the Fiscal Stability Treaty was signed
in 2012, the Euro Summitsâ€™ role has been set out in law.
