###  Fraud

If the overpayment happened as a result of fraud the Department can take a
criminal prosecution against you (even if you pay back the overpayment). The
most common types of welfare fraud include:

  * **Working and claiming:** Where a person claims a payment, such as Jobseeker's Benefit/Allowance or an illness payment, but takes up employment and does not notify the Department. 
  * **Non-disclosure of means:** Where a person claims a means-tested payment but does not fully disclose their means or sources of income. Note that If you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant are getting a means tested social welfare payment and save a portion of this payment each week, these savings as well as savings from most other sources will be taken into account as part of your means. It is important to notify the Department of these savings to avoid an overpayment. 
  * **Multiple claiming or personation:** Where a person makes a claim for more than one social welfare payment or by assuming and falsely using the identity and PPS Number of another person. 
  * **Life events:** Where a person continues to claim a payment to which he/she is no longer entitled such as a lone parent who marries or is cohabiting, or someone who continues to claim Carer’s Allowance where caring duties have ceased. 
  * **Cohabitation:** People may be living as a family unit and fail to notify this to the Department to qualify for higher rates of payments, or payments to which they may not be entitled. 
  * **Social insurance:** Where employers fail to maintain appropriate employment/wage records and where non-compliance or non-remittance of PRSI (Pay Related Social Insurance) occurs. 
  * **Non-residency in the State:** Where a person claims a social welfare payment which requires residency, and he/she is no longer resident.
