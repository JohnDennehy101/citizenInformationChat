##  Overpayments

An Overpayment can happen when you get an extra payment of an allowance,
pension or any other benefit from the [ Department of Social Protection
](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-employment-affairs-and-
social-protection/) and you are not entitled to it.

If you have been overpaid, the Department will inform you of:

  * The reason(s) for the overpayment 
  * The amount involved 

And

  * The way the Department proposes to get back the amount that has been overpaid. 

The liability to repay overpayments may continue to exist after your death.
Your personal representatives may be asked to repay the amounts owed from your
estate.
