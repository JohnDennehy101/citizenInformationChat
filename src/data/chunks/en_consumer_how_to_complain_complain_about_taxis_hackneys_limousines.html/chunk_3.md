##  Who to complain to

If you booked the service through a dispatch operator, complain first to the
dispatch operator â€“ see below.

If your complaint involves a criminal offence, contact your local Garda
Station.

If you want to complain because your driver was smoking, you should contact
the National Tobacco Control Office, HSE 1890 333 100. [ Environmental Health
Officers ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/environ/Contact.html) of the
HSE enforce most of the tobacco control legislation.
