##  What is Adoptive Benefit?

Adoptive Benefit is a payment made to a parent who is on [ adoptive leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/maternity-leave/) from work and covered by [ social insurance (PRSI)
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-
insurance/) .

Adoptive Benefit is paid for 24 weeks from the date you adopted your child.

To get the full 24 weeks of Adoptive Benefit, your adoptive leave must begin
on the date of adoption.

If a couple are adopting a child, only one parent can apply for Adoptive
Benefit. The parent not getting Adoptive Benefit can apply for [ paternity
leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/paternity-leave/) and [ Paternity Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/paternity-benefit/) .

You should apply for Adoptive Benefit 6 weeks before you plan to go on [
adoptive leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-
holidays/adoptive-leave/) (12 weeks if you are self-employed).

If you think you have been wrongly refused Adoptive Benefit, you can [ appeal
this decision ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-welfare-
appeals/) .
