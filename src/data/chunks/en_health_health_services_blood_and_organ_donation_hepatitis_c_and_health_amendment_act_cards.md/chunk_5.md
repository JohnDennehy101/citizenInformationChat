##  Hepatitis C Insurance Scheme

If you were infected with Hepatitis C and/or HIV from Human Immunoglobulin-
Anti-D or another blood product or blood transfusion in Ireland, you can
access the Hepatitis C Insurance Scheme. This provides access to life
assurance, mortgage protection and travel insurance.

If you are part of this scheme, you only pay the average basic premium that an
uninfected person of the same age and gender would pay. The scheme pays the
additional premiums levied or covers the additional risks that would otherwise
prevent a policy being taken out
