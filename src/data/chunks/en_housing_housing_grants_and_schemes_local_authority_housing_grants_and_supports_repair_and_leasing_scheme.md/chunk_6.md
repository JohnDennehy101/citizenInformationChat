###  Arranging the repairs

You can arrange a contractor yourself to carry out the repairs. If you are not
in a position to do this, the local authority or AHB can engage a contractor
instead. You will need to give formal written permission to the local
authority or AHB to arrange for works to be done on the property.

If you are arranging a contractor yourself, you must list out the works to be
done and get a quote from the contractor. This must be agreed with the local
authority or AHB before the work starts. The contractor must be tax-compliant
and be able to provide evidence of this on request.

When the work is finished, you should get an invoice from the contractor and
give it to the local authority or AHB, who will arrange a site visit to check
that the work meets the required standard.

If all is in order, the local authority or AHB will pay you the agreed amount
to settle the contractorâ€™s invoice. You will need to provide a receipt from
the contractor.
