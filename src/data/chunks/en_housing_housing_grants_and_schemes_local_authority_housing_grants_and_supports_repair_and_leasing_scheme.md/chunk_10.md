###  Repaying the cost of repairs

The cost of the repairs will be offset against the agreed rental payment until
the value of the works is repaid. The local authority or AHB will agree with
you what the appropriate offset period will be in your case. The agreement
will contain a clawback clause to ensure that the full value of the works will
be repaid if the property becomes unavailable during the agreed period.
Further information about the offset period and clawback clause is available
in the vacanthome.ie [ FAQ page on the scheme
](https://vacanthomes.ie/owners/repair-and-leasing-scheme-faq/) .
