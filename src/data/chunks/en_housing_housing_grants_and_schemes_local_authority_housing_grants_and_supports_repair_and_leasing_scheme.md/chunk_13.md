###  Ongoing maintenance, repairs and other charges

Certain responsibilities apply whether you have agreed a direct lease or an
RAA with the local authority or AHB. As the owner, you remain responsible for
structural insurance, structural maintenance and structural repair. You are
also responsible for paying management company service charges, if applicable,
and any other charges for which you are liable, such as [ Local Property Tax
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) .

If you have agreed a lease agreement the local authority or AHB is responsible
for internal maintenance and repairs during the term of the lease. And at the
end of the term, the property will be returned to you in good repair, except
for fair wear and tear.

However, in the case of an RAA agreement, you will manage and support the
tenants and maintain the property internally for the term of the agreement.
