##  What is the Repair and Leasing Scheme?

The purpose of the Repair and Leasing Scheme is to bring vacant properties in
need of repair, back into use for social housing. The scheme is aimed at
owners of vacant properties who cannot afford the repairs needed to bring
their property up to the standard required to rent it out.

However, under a pilot expansion of the scheme, property owners of certain
categories of buildings do not have to meet the requirement of being unable to
afford or unable to fund the repairs. This applies to the following categories
of properties:

  * Vacant commercial units 
  * Vacant units associated with a commercial unit, for example, a flat over a shop 
  * Vacant institutional buildings 
  * Unfinished developments, which have been vacant for a significant amount of time 

If your vacant property is suitable for social housing, the cost of necessary
repairs is paid by the local authority or [ approved housing body (AHB)
](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/approved-housing-bodies/) .
You then lease, or make the property available, to the local authority or AHB,
who will use it for social housing. You will get an agreed rental payment from
the local authority or AHB and the value of the repairs will be gradually
offset against this rental payment over a specified period.

There is an [ FAQ with more information about the scheme on vacanthomes.ie

If you notice a vacant home in your area, you can report this to your local
authority using the online form on [ vacanthomes.ie ](https://vacanthomes.ie/)
. The local authority will investigate and, if appropriate, work to bring the
vacant home back into use.
