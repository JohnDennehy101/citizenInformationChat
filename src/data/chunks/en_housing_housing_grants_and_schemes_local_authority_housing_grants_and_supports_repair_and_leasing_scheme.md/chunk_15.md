##  How much can I get?

The maximum repair cost under the scheme is €80,000 per house or apartment
including VAT. This can include the cost of required furniture, as agreed with
the local authority or AHB.

The cost of the repairs will be offset against the agreed rental payment until
the value of the works is repaid. The local authority or AHB will agree with
you what the appropriate offset period will be in your case.

The amount paid to you will be agreed through negotiation with the local
authority or AHB. The maximum to be agreed will be a percentage of the current
market rent.

  * For most direct leases this is 80% of the current market rent. However, it is 85% for apartments with a significant service charge and 70% for properties under the pilot scheme. 
  * For RAA’s it is 92% of the current market rent or 95% for apartments with a significant service charge. 

Rent reviews will usually take place every 3 or 4 years.
