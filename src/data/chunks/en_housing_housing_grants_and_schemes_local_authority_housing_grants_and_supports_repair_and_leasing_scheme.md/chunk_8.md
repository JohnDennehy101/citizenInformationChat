####  Agreeing a direct lease agreement

If you decide to lease your property directly to the local authority or AHB
you will sign an Agreement to Lease. This indicates that you agree to the
length of the lease, the market rent of the property and a schedule of the
works required. You will also agree how the cost of the works will be recouped
through the lease payments.
