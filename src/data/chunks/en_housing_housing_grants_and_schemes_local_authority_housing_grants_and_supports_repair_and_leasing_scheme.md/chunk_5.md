###  What repairs are needed?

If the property meets requirements, the local authority or AHB will inspect it
and provide you with a checklist of the repairs that are necessary to bring it
up to the standard required. These requirements may vary in each local
authority. But when the repairs are completed, all properties must:

  * Be in good structural condition and subject to inspection by the local authority or AHB 
  * Comply with the [ minimum standards for rented houses ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/minimum-standards-for-rented-homes/)
  * Have a [ Building Energy Rating (BER) certificate ](https://www.seai.ie/home-energy/building-energy-rating-ber/)

All properties must be furnished and include certain appliances. There is more
detail about this in the vacanthomes.ie [ FAQ page on the scheme
](https://vacanthomes.ie/owners/repair-and-leasing-scheme-faq/) .
