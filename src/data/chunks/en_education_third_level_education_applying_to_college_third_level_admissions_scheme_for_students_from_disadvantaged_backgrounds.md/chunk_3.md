###  How the HEAR scheme works

Each of the third-level colleges participating in the scheme has reserved a
number of places on its courses for school-leavers who are eligible for HEAR.
You can find details of the places available through HEAR on the [ websites of
the participating third-level colleges
](http://accesscollege.ie/hear/participating-colleges/) .

You apply for HEAR through the Central Applications Office (CAO) – see ‘How to
apply’ below.

Once you have been accepted as eligible for HEAR, you then compete for the
reduced point places based on your Leaving Certificate results. A _reduced
point_ _place_ means that you may get a place on a third-level course with
fewer than the full CAO points. For example, if you are eligible for HEAR and
you get 350 Leaving Certificate points, you may be offered a place on a course
that is 360 points through CAO. However, you must meet the college
matriculation and any specific course entry requirements.
