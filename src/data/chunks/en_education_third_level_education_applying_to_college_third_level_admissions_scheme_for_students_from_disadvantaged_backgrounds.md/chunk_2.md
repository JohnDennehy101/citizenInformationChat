##  What is HEAR?

The Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) is an admissions scheme for students
from socially disadvantaged backgrounds.

The scheme aims to improve access to college for school-leavers from socio-
economic backgrounds that are under-represented in third-level education.
Under the HEAR scheme a number of third-level places are allocated to school-
leavers on a reduced points basis. To be eligible for the scheme you must meet
certain indicators (or criteria) related to your financial, social and
cultural circumstances – see ‘Indicators’ below.
