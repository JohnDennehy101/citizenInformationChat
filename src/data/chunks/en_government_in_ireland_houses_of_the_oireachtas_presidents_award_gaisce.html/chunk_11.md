When you have decided which activities you would like to attempt in each
section of the Award, you can agree the challenge with your PAL.

When the challenge is agreed, you apply and pay the fee online. The PAL will
then activate your application, so that you can begin the agreed activities.

If you are under 18 you will need a signed consent form from your parent or
guardian.

Your PAL will monitor you during your Gaisce challenge and sign off at the
end, if you have carried out your agreed challenges and met the standard of
the award.
