##  What is the Gaisce award?

The President’s Award – called Gaisce – is a self-development programme for
young people in Ireland between the ages of 14 and 25. The word Gaisce means
great achievement. If you win an award you get a medal in a presentation box,
a certificate signed by the President and a lapel pin. If you win the Gold
award the president presents it to you at a special ceremony at Dublin Castle.

The [ Wavelength programme ](https://www.gaisce.ie/wavelength/) has been
created to support young people who are refugees or seeking asylum to achieve
their Gaisce Awards.

There is [ detailed information about Gaisce ](http://www.gaisce.ie/about-
gaisce/) on gaisce.ie.
