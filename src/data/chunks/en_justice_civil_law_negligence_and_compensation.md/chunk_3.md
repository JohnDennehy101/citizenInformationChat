##  Negligence in the context of an accident

It is not enough to have been in an accident or to have suffered injury in
order to obtain compensation from the courts. It must be clear that the party
or parties you have sued were to blame for the accident and the injuries that
you have suffered.

It may be the case that a number of people are partly to blame for an
accident, including the person suing. In that situation, the court will
apportion or divide the blame between the different people involved.

For example, a driver who suffered injury in a car accident in circumstances
where they were not wearing a seat-belt may be 15% to blame for the injuries
they suffered. As a result, the court may only award then 85% of the
compensation that their injuries are valued at.

Your claim for compensation will be divided into two parts.

**General damages**

This is compensation for the pain, suffering and inconvenience you experienced
and will continue to experience as a result of the accident.

The court will decide the level of damages by estimating the gravity of the
injuries. It will do this by considering all the medical evidence put before
it, notably the pain already suffered by the person suing and the prognosis
for the future â€“ that is, how long and to what intensity the injured party is
likely to continue suffering.

**Special damages**

This is compensation for the financial costs and expenses, both past and
future, you incurred as a result of the accident. This would include the cost
of repairing your car (if relevant), the medical costs you incurred, your loss
of earnings as a result of being unable to go to work and all expenses,
including travel, home-help and similar, you incurred.

You may be asked to produce receipts and bills to prove you have incurred all
of these expenses so it is important to keep a file of every bill and receipt.
