##  Can I get paid maternity leave from work?

If you are pregnant while in employment, you are entitled to [ maternity leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/maternity-leave/) . You can get maternity leave
from work regardless of how long you have been working for a company or the
number of hours worked per week. It includes casual workers.

You can take up to 42 weeks off work, for maternity leave. This is usually
made up of 26 weeks’ paid leave (if you are eligible) and a further 16 weeks’
unpaid leave. You do not have to take the unpaid leave.

While you are on maternity leave, you may be entitled to [ Maternity Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/maternity-benefit/) from the Department of Social Protection.

Maternity Benefit is a payment made to women who are on maternity leave from
work and have enough [ Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) .

Maternity Benefit is paid at a standard weekly rate of €274 in 2024 for 26
weeks.

If you do not have enough PRSI contributions from your employment in Ireland,
you may be able to [ use social insurance contributions paid in a country
covered by EU Regulations and the UK
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-
abroad/) . You must be in insurable employment in Ireland and have paid your
most recent PRSI contribution in Ireland.

You can find out more about [ qualifying for Maternity Benefit and how to

children/maternity-benefit/#8c8ffb) .

Your employer does not have to pay you when you are on maternity leave. Some
employers may offer paid maternity leave, and you should check your employment
contract to see what applies to you. If your employer pays you while you are
on maternity leave, you may have to transfer payment of your Maternity Benefit
to your employer.
