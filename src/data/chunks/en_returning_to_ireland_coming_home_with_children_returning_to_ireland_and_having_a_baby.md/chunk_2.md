##  Introduction

If you or your partner are pregnant, you need to know about the maternity care
system in Ireland and the benefits and supports available to you.

If you have a baby when you return to live in Ireland, you can access
maternity care through the public health system.

You may plan to use private health services for maternity care. If you intend
to take out private health insurance to help cover the costs, you should know
that there is a 52-week waiting period for maternity-related claims. You can
