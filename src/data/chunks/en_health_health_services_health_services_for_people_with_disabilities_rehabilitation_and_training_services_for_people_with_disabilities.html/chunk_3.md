##  Who provides rehabilitative training?

HSE Disability Services organise the delivery of rehabilitative training
services in accredited training centres that are run by the HSE or by service
providers contracted by the HSE.

The HSE Occupational Guidance Service can help you find a training course that
is suited to your needs. They will meet you and your family or advocate and
look at your options. The type of training and support may differ from centre
to centre.

[ Contact your local HSE Disability Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/disability/disabilityservicescounty.html)
or service provider for specific information on the programmes they run and to
check if you are eligible to attend.

In some cases, the local disability service provider may organise transport
and travel to and from your rehabilitative training service.
