##  Will I get paid for doing rehabilitative training?

No, but you can continue to receive your social welfare payments while
training. You may also be eligible for the Rehabilitative Training Bonus (see
below).

Check if you are eligible for weekly [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) or other [ social
welfare payments for people living with a disability ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/) .
