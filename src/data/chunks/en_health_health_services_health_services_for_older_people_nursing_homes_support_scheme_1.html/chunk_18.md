###  How is rental income from your home calculated?

[ Since 1 February 2024
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2023/si/618/made/en/print) , if you own
**your home** and are renting it out to a tenant while you are in a nursing
home, you can apply to keep 100% of this rental income, instead of having to
pay some of it towards your nursing home care. This means you can keep all of
the rental income from renting your own home. Your home is your principal
private residence.

If the property you are renting is not your own home, you must pay 80% of the
rental income to nursing home care.
