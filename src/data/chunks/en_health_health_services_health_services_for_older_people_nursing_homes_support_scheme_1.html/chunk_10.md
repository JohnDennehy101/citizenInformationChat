###  Step 2: Complete a Care Needs Assessment

The Care Needs Assessment will check if you can be supported to continue
living at home or if long-term nursing home care is more appropriate.

The HSE will contact you to complete the Care Needs Assessment.

Healthcare professionals appointed by the HSE such as a public health nurse
will carry out the assessment.

The assessment may:

  * Take place in a hospital or a community setting like your home 
  * Involve a physical examination 

The [ care needs assessment (pdf) ](https://www2.hse.ie/file-library/fair-
deal/common-summary-assessment-report.pdf) will look at:

  * Your ability to do daily activities like bathing, shopping, dressing and moving around 
  * How you currently use any health and personal services such as a home-care assistant or nurse 
  * The family and community support available to you 
  * Your wishes and preferences 

You may be asked for more information to complete the Care Needs Assessment,
such as a referral from your GP. You should provide this as soon as possible
to complete your application.
