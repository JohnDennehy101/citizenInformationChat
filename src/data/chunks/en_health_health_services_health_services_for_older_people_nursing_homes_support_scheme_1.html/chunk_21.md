###  Couples and the '3-year cap'

If you are part of a couple, you will pay a 3.75% contribution based on your
home for a maximum of 3 years. Your total contribution over the 3 years is
capped at 11.25% of the property's value.

If both partners are in care, the total contribution is capped at 22.5%.

If you get the Nursing Home Loan for your home, your partner can also apply to
have the repayment of the loan deferred for their lifetime. Read about the [
