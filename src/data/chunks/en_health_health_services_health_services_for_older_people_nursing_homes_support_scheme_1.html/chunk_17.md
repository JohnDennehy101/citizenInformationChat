##  How much you pay towards your care

After assessing your income and assets, the Financial Assessment will work out
how much you pay towards your care.

You pay:

  * 80% of your income (less the deductions above), 

and

  * 7.5% of the value of your assets per year 

The first €36,000 of your assets, or €72,000 for a couple, are not counted in
the Financial Assessment.

If you are part of a couple, you will contribute half of the amounts above,
that is, 40% of your income and 3.75% of the value of your assets per year.

If your assets include land or property, the 7.5% contribution based on these
assets may be deferred and [ paid to Revenue after your death
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/life-events-and-personal-circumstances/nursing-
homes-fair-deal-loan/how-loan-repaid.aspx) . You can defer paying the 7.5%
contribution by applying for an optional nursing home loan.
