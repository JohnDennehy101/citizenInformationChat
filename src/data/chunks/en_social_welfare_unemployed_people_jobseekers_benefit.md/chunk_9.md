###  Loss of employment

You must have suffered a substantial loss of employment in any period of 7
consecutive days to qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit. This means that you must
have lost at least one day's employment and, as a result of this loss, be
unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7. Your earnings must also have been
reduced because of the loss of employment.

Casual workers and retained firefighters with no other employment are exempt
from this rule.
