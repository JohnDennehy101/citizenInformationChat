###  Re-qualifying for Jobseeker's Benefit

You can re-qualify for JB if:

  * You have used up your full JB entitlement (either 9 or 6 months) 

and

  * You have paid 13 PRSI contributions for at least 13 weeks (these contributions can be counted only after you have claimed at least 156 days (6 months) of JB) 

However, if you are working and claiming JB (systematic short-time workers and
part-time workers) you can't continue your JB claim when it is used up since
you must have suffered a substantial loss of employment to re-qualify for JB,
(unless you are a casual worker).

If you have lost your job you will have suffered a substantial loss of
employment. If you are a part-time or systematic short-time worker, DSP will
look at your pattern of employment over the last 13 weeks or another
representative period to find out whether you have suffered a substantial loss
of employment.

For example, if you are getting JB and working 3 days a week as a systematic
short-time worker or a part-time worker, and your employment pattern has not
changed during your JB claim, you will not have suffered a substantial loss of
employment and will not re-qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit when you exhaust
your claim. However, if your JB claim ends and your 3-day working week is then
reduced to a 2-day week, you will have suffered a substantial loss of
employment and may re-qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit.
