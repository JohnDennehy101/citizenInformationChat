payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-adult-
dependant/) and [ child dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-
payment-for-a-child-dependant/) (see below). Your average weekly earnings do
not affect the amount you get for a child dependant.

**Average weekly earnings**

Jobseeker's Benefit rates are based on your earnings in the relevant tax year.
Your average weekly earnings are your gross yearly earnings from employment
divided by the number of Class A, H or P paid contributions in the _relevant
tax year_ .

The relevant tax year is 2 years before the year of your claim. For example,
if you claim Jobseeker's Benefit in 2024 the relevant tax year is 2022. If you
qualify for a reduced JB payment, it may be of greater benefit for you to
claim [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-allowance/) instead of Jobseeker's Benefit.

If you had no earnings from work but got the Pandemic Unemployment Payment in
2021, you will meet the average weekly earnings requirement for a claim where
2021 is your relevant tax year, and get the maximum rate of Jobseeker’s
Benefit. However, if you had earnings from work in 2021, your average weekly
earnings will be calculated by dividing your gross yearly earnings by the
number of paid contributions.
