##  Social insurance (PRSI) contributions

To qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit, you must pay Class A, H or P PRSI
contributions. Class A is the one paid by most private sector employees. Class
H is paid by soldiers, reservists and temporary army nurses, who do not
qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit until they have left the army. To qualify you
need:

  * At least 104 weeks of Class A, H or P PRSI paid contributions or at least 156 Class S PRSI contributions since you first started work 

**And**

  * 39 weeks of A, H or P PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year (a minimum of 13 weeks must be paid contributions ***** ) 

**Or**

  * 26 weeks of A, H or P PRSI paid in the relevant tax year and 26 weeks of PRSI paid in the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year. 

***** If you do not have 13 paid contributions in the relevant tax year, you
must have paid 13 contributions in any of the following years:

  * The 2 tax years before the relevant tax year 
  * The last complete tax year 
  * The current tax year. 

The relevant tax year is the second-last complete tax year before the year in
which your claim is made. So, for claims made in 2024, the relevant tax year
is 2022.
