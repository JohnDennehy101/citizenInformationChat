##  Liability in the event of an accident

There is no financial limit on the liability of an EU airline for damages
sustained in the event of death, wounding or any other bodily injury. For
damages up to 128, 821 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), the airline cannot
contest claims for compensation.

[ Special Drawing Rights (SDR)
](http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/sdr.htm) are a mix of currency
values established by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The [ current
value of an SDR in Euro is available on the IMF's website
](http://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_mth.aspx?reportType=CVSDR) . The
liability limits are reviewed every 5 years. Find out more about an airline's
liability following the death or injury of a passenger, or damage or loss of
