##  Travel agents and your flight information

You have the right to neutral and accurate information when booking a flight
through a travel agent. In other words, your travel agent must supply you with
objective information (for example information that does not favour one
airline over another or selective information about availability). If a travel
agent is using an online reservation system, they should remain impartial
until you suggest a preference or give the travel agent an option. This means
your travel agent must supply information on all of the following options (in
this order):

  * Non-stop flights (flights that travel directly from one point to your destination) 
  * Flights with intermediate stops (flights that operate with a stop-over and then proceed to your destination) 
  * Connecting flights (a journey made up of two or more flights before you reach your destination) 
  * All the available fares from various airlines 

When you book your ticket, your travel agent must pass on all of the
information available including:

  * The airline that will provide the service (if this is different from the airline mentioned on your ticket) 
  * Changes of aircraft that may occur during your journey 
  * Details of stops during your journey 
  * Transfers between airports that may occur during your journey 

If you are travelling as part of a package holiday, the travel organiser must
give you all of the essential information about the holiday before you agree
to the contract. You can read more about rights in our page on [ package
holidays and linked travel arrangements ](/en/consumer/travel/package-
holidays/) .
