##  Making a complaint

If you have a complaint about the assistance and compensation you have
received for denied boarding or cancelled or delayed flights, you must begin
by contacting your airline directly.

If you feel your rights have not been met and you have not received the level
of treatment or compensation to which you are entitled, you should contact the
[ Irish Aviation Authority ](https://www.iaa.ie/consumer-protection/air-
passenger-rights) or the [ Competition and Consumer Protection Commission
(CCPC) ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/how-to-
complain/?gclid=CjwKCAiAxJSPBhAoEiwAeO_fPyW7ZWJmIeB7fpAALP1CX3IRu4eX3AfPTtIUAbFW1_xPr4cQCTElPhoCwQgQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
and make a complaint. You can also contact the Directorate-General for
Transport and Energy of the European Commission.
