##  Preparing for the CVRT

To prepare for the CVRT, ensure the vehicle is in a reasonably clean state
(especially the under body) and accessible for inspection.

You should check your vehicle for the following:

  * Engine has oil and water 
  * Engine is in a fit state to be tested, for example, the timing belt or chain has been replaced in line with your manufacturer`s guidance. You may be asked to sign a disclaimer at your chosen test centre 
  * Windscreen washer has water 
  * Wheel hubcaps are removed (where it is not physically possible to otherwise check the wheel nuts) and the tyres are inflated to the correct pressure 
  * Safety belts are visible and working correctly 
  * Registration plates are clean and comply with current regulations 
  * Temperature gauge is showing as normal before arriving at the test centre
