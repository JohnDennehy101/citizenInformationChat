##  Introduction

The Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Test (CVRT) is a legally required test
for all commercial vehicles in Ireland.

It aims to:

  * Ensure vehicle safety 
  * Contribute to road safety 
  * Confirm that vehicles meet basic safety standards 

It is separate from the [ National Car Testing Service (NCT)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-
standards/national-car-test/) network which only tests cars.

All commercial vehicles must be tested when they are over one year old and
every year after that.​

If you own a [ motor caravan ](https://www.cvrt.ie/en-US/Test-Bookings/Motor-
Caravans/) , you need a CVRT even if you do not use it commercially. You need
to do this 4 years after it was first registered.

When you pass your test, will you get a [ Certificate of Road Worthiness
(CRW)​ ](https://www.cvrt.ie/en-US/Certificate-of-Roadworthiness/) .

The Road Safety Authority (RSA) is responsible for authorising, supervising,
and managing commercial vehicle test centres and testers.

This page has information on how to apply for a CVRT, preparing for the test
and understanding your results.
