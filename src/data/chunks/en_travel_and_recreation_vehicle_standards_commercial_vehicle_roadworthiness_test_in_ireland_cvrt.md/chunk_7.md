##  Cost of CVRT

The [ CVRT fee ](https://www.cvrt.ie/en-US/About-CVRT/CVR-Test-Fees/) depends
on the size of your vehicle.

**Re-tests**

A visual re-test is free, but a re-test that requires a test lane has a fee.

All re-tests must be completed within **21 calendar days** and within 4,000
kms of the initial test or you must repeat the full test.

**Pass pending recheck of minor deficiencies**

There is no fee for a recheck if the test result for your vehicle is a pass
pending recheck of minor deficiencies. There is also no 21-day and 4,000 km
rule for completing the recheck. However, you will not get a CRW until the
testing centre has confirmed that the minor deficiencies have been fixed.
