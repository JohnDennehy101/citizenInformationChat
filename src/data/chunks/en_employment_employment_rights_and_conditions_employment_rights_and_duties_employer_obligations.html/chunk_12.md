###  Preventing accidents

As an employer you must, as far as is reasonably practicable, ensure [
employees’ safety, health and welfare at work ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/health-and-safety/health-safety-work/) . This is
outlined in the [ Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2005/act/10/enacted/en/print) .

To prevent workplace injuries and illness you must:

  * Provide and keep safe workplaces, machinery and equipment 
  * reduce the chance of risks when using any item or substance and from exposure to physical agents, noise and vibration 
  * Prevent any improper conduct or behaviour which might put the safety, health and welfare of employees at risk (for example, ‘horseplay’ or bullying at work) 
  * Provide instruction and training to employees on health and safety 
  * Provide protective clothing and equipment to employees at no cost to employees. (This does not apply if the person is self-employed) 
  * Appoint a suitable person as the organisation’s safety officer 

If you are an employer, you must carry out a risk assessment for yourr
workplace.

A risk assessment should:

  * Identify any hazards in the workplace 
  * Assess the risks associated with these hazards 
  * Identify the steps needed to deal with these risk 

You must also prepare a safety statement based on the risk assessment.

Tools to help you with these tasks are provided by the [ Health and Safety
Authority ](http://www.hsa.ie/) .
