##  Contracts and terms of employment

If your employees are working for a regular wage or salary, they automatically
have a contract of employment. The full contract of employment does not have
to be put in writing. However, your employee must receive a written statement
of the **core terms of employment** within the first 5 days of starting a job.

You must provide the employee with a statement of the remaining terms within
one month of them starting work. You can get more details in our page [
contract of employment ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) .

You should outline most terms and conditions of employment in a written
contract or a company handbook. However, custom and practice in the workplace
can also count as a term of employment (for example, a mid-morning break of 10
minutes).

If you want to change a term or condition of employment, you must agree this
change with the employee. Under contract law, both the employer and the
employee must agree to [ changes in the terms of a contract
