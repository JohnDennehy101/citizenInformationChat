##  Managing your employment records

You must comply with your data protection obligations when collecting CVs and
related information about individuals. General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) has not affected your legal obligations set out in employment law.

For example, you must continue to keep certain data, such as records of
employeesâ€™ working hours and rates of pay. These employee records show that
you are following employment legislation.

During [ inspections by the Workplace Relations Commission
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/enforcement-employment-rights-
legislation/) , you must allow the inspectors access to these records.

See [ workplacerelations.ie ](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/) for a [
guide to how inspections are carried out (pdf)
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/publications_forms/employers_guide_to_inspections.pdf)
.

Under data protection legislation, employees can find out what information an
organisation holds about them by making a request to [ access personal data
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/know-your-rights/right-access-
information) . You must have procedures in place to respond to such a request
within one month. This period can be extended by a further 2 months if there
are a lot of requests or if the requests are complex.
