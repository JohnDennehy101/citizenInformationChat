##  Disciplinary procedures and dismissal

As an employer, you should have written grievance and disciplinary procedures
in place. Disciplinary procedures set out the stages and processes you will
follow when dealing with the alleged shortcomings of an employee.

These procedures are outlined by the Workplace Relations Commission in their [
Code of Practice: Grievance and Disciplinary Procedures
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/cop3/)
.

Generally, the procedures allow for informal warnings, followed by written
warnings and ultimately to dismissal. Under the Unfair Dismissals Acts you
must give employees written notice of these procedures before [ dismissing
them ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/)
.

You must give your employees a copy of your grievance and disciplinary
procedures within 28 days of their start date. If you are considering
dismissing an employee, you must follow fair procedures.

These include:

  * Giving your employee appropriate warnings 
  * Making them fully aware of the allegations against them, and 
  * Giving them an opportunity to present their side 

You must also give them the opportunity to be represented in any disciplinary
procedures by, for example, a trade union official or other representative.

If you do dismiss an employee, you must be able to show you had [ fair grounds
for dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/fair-
grounds-for-dismissal/) and followed fair procedures.
