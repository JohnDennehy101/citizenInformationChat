###  If I don't need an entry visa to enter Ireland, do I need a student visa
to study?

No. If you do not need an entry visa to enter Ireland, you do not need a
student visa to study in Ireland. However, all non-EEA nationals, including
those with visas, must get permission to enter the State by reporting to an
Immigration Officer at the port of entry. (The members of the EEA are the 27
countries of the European Union (EU), together with Iceland, Norway and
Liechtenstein). You must still register at your local immigration office after
you arrive. You need to get an Irish Residence Permit (IRP) if you are
studying for more than 3 months.

You should have all documentation relating to your studies on your person when
coming through immigration. In other words, you should have your letter of
offer of a place at the school, or educational institution ready for
inspection at immigration. You can read more in our page on [ permission to
land in Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/permission-to-land-in-
ireland/) .
