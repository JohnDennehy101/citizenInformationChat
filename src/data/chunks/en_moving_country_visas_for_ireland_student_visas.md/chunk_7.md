###  What do I do if I want to leave for a short while?

A visa required national with a valid Irish Residence Permit (IRP) or GNIB
card will not need a [ re-entry visa ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-
ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-ireland/) when traveling to and from
Ireland. Your IRP card and passport will be accepted.

If you want to travel to Northern Ireland, you may need a visa. You can get
more information from [ UK Visas and Immigration ](https://www.gov.uk/contact-
ukvi-outside-uk) .
