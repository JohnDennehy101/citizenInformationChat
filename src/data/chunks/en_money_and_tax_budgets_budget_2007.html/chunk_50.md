###  Capital Gains Tax retirement relief â€“ disposals of leased land

An exemption from CGT applies in the case of individuals aged 55 and over who
dispose of qualifying business or farming assets. In order for a farming asset
to qualify under the relief it must have been owned and used for farming
purposes for at least ten years prior to disposal. The relief is now being
extended, in certain circumstances, to disposals of land where the land had
been leased prior to disposal.
