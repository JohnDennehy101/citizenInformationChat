###  Changes to the stamp duty relief for young trained farmers

Stamp duty relief is available for farmers acquiring land, who are aged under
35 and have specific agricultural training. Amendments are now being made to
the education criteria and refunds procedure in this relief. Firstly, the
FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate in Agriculture will become the new minimum
education requirement from 31 March 2008; secondly, the qualifying third-level
course titles are being updated; and finally, the refunds procedure is being
simplified.
