###  Administrative changes to help taxpayers claim reliefs

A number of changes in administrative procedures are being introduced which
will make it easier for taxpayers to claim reliefs to which they are entitled.
For 2007 all age-related tax credits will, where possible, be credited
automatically to the taxpayer where a verified date of birth can be
established through Revenue or Social Welfare records.  
  
A system will be implemented to credit tax relief on trade union subscriptions
automatically, based on trade union membership lists. For 2008 it is planned
to move, where possible, to automatic repayments in respect of non-reimbursed
hospital expenses, prescribed drugs pharmacy costs and certain tuition fees to
the extent that this is possible using information from appropriate third
parties.  
  
Tax relief due on medical insurance paid by employers that has been subject to
benefit-in-kind taxation will be automatically included in the employee tax
credit. Work will be progressed on applying similar procedures in due course
to nursing home and other medical expenses that qualify for tax relief.
