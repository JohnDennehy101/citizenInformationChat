###  Small benefit exemption

The [ small benefit exemption ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-
people/benefit-in-kind-for-employers/valuation-of-benefits/small-benefit-
exemption.aspx) allows you to get some vouchers or other non-cash benefits
each year without paying tax on them.

From 1 January 2022, you can get up to 2 benefits each year, up to a total
value of â‚¬1,000. If more benefits are given in a year, only the first 2
benefits qualify.

The vouchers or benefits can only be used to purchase goods or services. They
cannot be exchanged for cash.
