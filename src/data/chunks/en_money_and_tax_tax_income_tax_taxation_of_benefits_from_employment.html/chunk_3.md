##  How benefits are taxed

Most benefits are added to your pay and taxed in the same way. Your employer
deducts income tax, Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social
Insurance (PRSI) on the value of the benefit.

The rules applying to benefits-in-kind vary. Generally, the value of the
benefit is the higher of:

  * The cost to the employer 
  * The market value of the benefit 

If the employee contributes an amount towards the benefit, the taxable value
of the benefit is reduced by that amount.

Special rules apply to the following benefits-in-kind:

  * [ Use of a car ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/benefit-in-kind-for-employers/private-use-company-cars/index.aspx)
  * [ Use of a van ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/benefit-in-kind-for-employers/private-use-of-company-vans/index.aspx)
  * [ Use of other assets ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/benefit-in-kind-for-employers/free-use-of-assets/index.aspx)
