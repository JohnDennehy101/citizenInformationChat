##  Introduction

Most benefits from employment that you get in addition to your salary are
taxed.

Generally, there are two types of benefits you can get from your employer in
addition to your salary:

  * Money or other benefits that can be turned into money. Examples include tickets to events, vouchers or having your bills paid by your employer. 
  * Benefits-in-kind. These are benefits that cannot be converted into cash but have a cash value. They are usually something that an employee has the use of without owning it. Examples include loans at a special rate or the use of a company car or accommodation.
