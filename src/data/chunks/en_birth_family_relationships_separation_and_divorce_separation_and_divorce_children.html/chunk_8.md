##  Going to court

If you cannot agree on your child arrangements, you can apply to the court for
the court to decide. Your childâ€™s welfare is the most important factor the
court will consider.

Some family law issues are resolved without legal representation but it is
always recommended you get legal advice. A solicitor who specialises in family
law can help you by explaining the process and your options. Find [ contact
