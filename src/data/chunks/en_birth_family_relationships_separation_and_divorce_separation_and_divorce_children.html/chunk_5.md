##  Access

Access refers to your child's right to have direct contact with the parent
they do not live with. It can include the child staying overnight either
occasionally, on alternate weekends or during school holidays. It can also
include the parent and child going on holidays together.

The parents may informally agree between themselves the arrangements for
custody and access to the child.

If an agreement cannot be reached, either parent may apply to the court to
decide which parent will have custody of the child and what access the non-
custodial parent will have. You can make an application to the District Court,
or can apply for [ judicial separation ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/judicial-separation/) or [ divorce
](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) in
the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) .

In an application for custody or access, the childâ€™s welfare is the most
important factor the court will consider. Your child has a right to see both
parents, and access by the non-custodial parent will only be denied if the
court believes it is not in the best interest of the child. The court can set
out the time, place and duration of access visits. The court can also order
supervised access where another adult is present during visits, if it
considers it appropriate.

If you want to get an access order, you can go to your local [ District Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) and get the Court Clerk to issue
an application for access, which will be served on the other spouse. You are
advised to get legal advice and representation for this process.
