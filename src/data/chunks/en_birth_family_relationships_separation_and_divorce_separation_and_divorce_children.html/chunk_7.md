##  Get help agreeing

[ Family mediation ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/family-mediation-separating-couples/) can help you and your ex-partner
agree on child arrangements. A mediator is independent and does not take
sides.

Mediation is not relationship counselling. If you know there is no possibility
of reconciliation, mediation can help you agree on the details of how you’ll
look after your children, such as:

  * Where they live 
  * When they spend time with each parent 
  * When and what other types of contact take place (phone calls, for example) 
  * Child maintenance payments 

Mediation allows you and your ex-partner to make your own decisions, rather
than going to court and having a judge make them for you. Mediation can be an
effective, cheaper and quicker alternative to court.

At the end of mediation, you will get a document showing what you agreed. This
agreement is not legally binding. The mediated agreement is not a legal
agreement, however, you can bring this document to a solicitor to be drawn
into a legal contract or deed of separation. You may also use it as the basis
for a decree of divorce.
