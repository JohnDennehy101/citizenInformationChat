##  Funeral arrangements and costs

One of the first things you have to do after the death is to make [ funeral
arrangements ](/en/death/practical-arrangements-after-a-death/funeral-
arrangements-and-costs/) . An undertaker or funeral director can deal with
most aspects of the funeral. The Irish Association of Funeral Directors (IAFD)
has a [ list of funeral directors ](https://www.iafd.ie/members) . There is a
[ code of practice ](https://www.iafd.ie/code-of-practice) that explains what
you can expect from its members.

If the person died in hospital, their body will be brought to the hospital
mortuary until funeral arrangements are made. You can choose to bring them
home or have them brought to a funeral home.

The person may have left instructions in their will about the type of funeral
they wanted, where they wanted their remains laid to rest and if they wanted a
religious or non-religious funeral service.

You may prefer a small private funeral or you may feel a large funeral is more
appropriate. In general, this is a personal choice that you and your family
should make.
