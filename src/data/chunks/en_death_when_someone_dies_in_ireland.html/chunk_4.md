##  Who should I notify about the death?

You should tell a number of State institutions that the person has died. If
the person was getting a State pension or another social welfare payment, you
must [ inform the Department of Social Protection (DSP) ](/en/social-
welfare/death-related-benefits/social-welfare-payments-following-a-death/)
that they have died. You must also inform the DSP if you were getting [
Carer’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) or [ Carer’s
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) for looking after them.

Telling other people that someone close to you has died can be very difficult.
You can ask a friend or family member to help you to contact the person’s
friends, work colleagues and family. It is customary to place a notice in a
local or national newspaper when a death has taken place to let people know
about it. This is now often done online through services like [ RIP.ie
](https://rip.ie/) . Your funeral director can help you with this.
