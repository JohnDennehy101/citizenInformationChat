##  How to check the radon level in my home

Homes in some parts of the country are more likely to have a radon problem
than others. Use the [ EPAâ€™s interactive radon map
](https://gis.epa.ie/EPAMaps/Radon?&lid=EPA:RadonRiskMapofIreland) to check if
you live in a high radon area. This is different to having your home tested
for radon. Even if you are living in a low radon area on the map, your home
may have high levels of radon when tested.

Every home has different amounts of radon so the EPA recommends that everyone
has their home tested for radon. The EPA has a list of [ registered radon
testing services ](https://www.epa.ie/environment-and-you/radon/radon-
testing/) .

Testing involves placing two small detection devices in the house for three
months. This period allows for variations in radon levels due to changes in
weather, ventilation, and so on. At the end of three months, you post the
detectors back to the testing laboratory. The lab calculates the radon level
in becquerels per cubic metre, expressed as Bq/m3. [ Read more about testing
