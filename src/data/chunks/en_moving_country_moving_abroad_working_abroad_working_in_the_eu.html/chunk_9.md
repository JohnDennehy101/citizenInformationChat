###  Social security

The [ aim of EU policy is to ensure that you are part of a social security
system ](/en/moving-country/moving-abroad/leaving-ireland/leaving-ireland-and-
your-social-security-entitlements/) and that you do not lose your rights,
regardless of the member state you decide to work in.

In principle, you are insured for social security purposes in the country you
work in. You, and in certain circumstances, your family are entitled to the
same social security benefits as citizens of the country in which you work.
These rights cover sickness and maternity benefits, disability, old-age and
survivor's benefits, benefits for accidents at work, occupational illness,
death and unemployment, as well as family allowances. You have to pay the same
level of contributions as host country citizens. You cannot be excluded from
benefits on grounds of nationality, for reasons of residence, or for any other
discriminatory reason.

You can find more information in, [ Leaving Ireland and your social security
entitlements. ](/en/moving-country/moving-abroad/leaving-ireland/leaving-
ireland-and-your-social-security-entitlements/)
