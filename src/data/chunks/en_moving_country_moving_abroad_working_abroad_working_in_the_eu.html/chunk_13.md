##  Cross-border workers

You are a [ cross-border worker
](http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/work-abroad/cross-border-
commuters/index_en.htm) (also known as a frontier worker) if you live in one
EU country but work in another EU country, and you go home at least once a
week. As a cross-border worker, you must be treated in the same way as an
employee who is living in the country of employment as regards the right to
apply for jobs, working conditions and social benefits.

You pay social security contributions in the member state where you are
employed and you are subject to the legislation of that state even if you live
in another member state.

Generally, you get short-term benefits from the country where you last paid
insurance and long-term benefits proportionately from all the countries in
which you paid insurance.

For cross-border workers, the rule on unemployment benefit is:

  * During partial or intermittent unemployment, you get your benefit from your country of employment 
  * During periods of full unemployment, you get your benefit from your country of residence.
