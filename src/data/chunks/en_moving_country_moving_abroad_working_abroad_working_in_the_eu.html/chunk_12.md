###  Freedom to provide services

You may choose to offer your services in another EU country without living
there permanently. If you comply with the rules of the profession or trade
that apply in your own country, you can offer those services anywhere else in
the EU. You can travel to assist clients located in another EU country or you
can provide paid services from your country of residence without travelling
there.
