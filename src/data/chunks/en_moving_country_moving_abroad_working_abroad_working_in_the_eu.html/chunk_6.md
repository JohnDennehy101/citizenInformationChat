###  Professional qualifications

A system for the [ recognition of qualifications ](/en/returning-to-
ireland/starting-work/Recognition-of-professional-qualifications-in-ireland/)
in most regulated professions is in place across the EU. If you wish to work
in a profession that is regulated in the country of employment, (for example,
a teacher, lawyer, engineer or psychologist) you must apply for recognition of
your qualifications in that country. The authorities have 4 months to reply to
you. If they consider that your training is significantly different in terms
of duration or content from the training in the host country, you may be asked
to get either additional professional experience, or to take a training course
or to take an aptitude test.

If you are a doctor, a general nurse, a dentist, a midwife, a vet, a
pharmacist or an architect, your national qualifications are in principle
recognised automatically.

If your profession is not regulated in the country in which you wish to work,
formal recognition of your qualifications is not needed.
