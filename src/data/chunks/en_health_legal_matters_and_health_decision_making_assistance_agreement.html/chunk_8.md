##  Changing or ending your decision-making assistant agreement

You or your decision-making assistant can end the decision-making assistance
agreement at any time. You do not have to replace it with another type of
decision support arrangement. If you need more support for making decisions,
you can appoint a [ co-decision-maker ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-
health/co-decision-making-agreement/) or a [ decision-making representative
](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/decision-making-representative-order/) .

A decision-making assistance agreement can be changed at any time. Any changes
to your decision-making assistance agreement must be agreed with your
decision-making assistant.
