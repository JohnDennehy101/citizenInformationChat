###  If you are on unpaid sick leave

The Department of Social Protection will tell Revenue how much Illness Benefit
or OIB you were paid.

Revenue will then issue you with an amended Tax Credit Certificate and let
your employer know about changes to your income tax so that they can make any
adjustment.
