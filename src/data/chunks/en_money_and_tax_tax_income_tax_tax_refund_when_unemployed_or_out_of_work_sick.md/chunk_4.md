##  Is my social welfare payment taxable?

If you are getting a social welfare payment, it may be taxable income.

[ Taxable social welfare payments ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/taxation-of-social-welfare-payments/)
include:

  * [ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) (the first €13 per week is not taxable) 
  * [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/)
  * Payments under the [ Occupational Injury Benefit (OIB) Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/occupational-injuries-benefit-overview/) (including [ Injury Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/injury-benefit/) , [ Disablement Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disablement-benefit/) and Incapacity Supplement) 

These payments are liable to income tax but not [ Universal Social Charge
(USC) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) or [ Pay
Related Social Insurance (PRSI) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/) .

If you get an [ Increase for a Qualified Child ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/claiming-and-increase-
in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) with Illness Benefit or with an OIB
payment, the increase is not taxable for income tax.
