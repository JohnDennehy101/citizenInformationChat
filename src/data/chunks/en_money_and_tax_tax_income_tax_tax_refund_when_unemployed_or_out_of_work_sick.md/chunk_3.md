##  Why would I get a tax refund if I am out of work?

For [ PAYE ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/what-is-
paye/index.aspx) workers, your tax is spread out evenly over the year. For
example, if your income is the same throughout the year, the income tax rate
for each pay period will be the same and at the end of the year the total tax
paid should be the appropriate amount.

However, if you become unemployed half-way through the year, for example, your
income tax may need to be adjusted because:

  * The tax deducted during the first half of the year was based on your income at that time 
  * Your reduced income in the second half of the year makes your annual taxable income lower than was expected so the amount of tax you have to pay may be lower than expected 

As a result, you may be due a refund of some of the tax you paid.

The amount of tax refunded depends on:

  * The length of time you have been unemployed 
  * The amount of tax you have paid 
  * The amount of tax credits you have used 
  * The amount of your weekly social welfare payment
