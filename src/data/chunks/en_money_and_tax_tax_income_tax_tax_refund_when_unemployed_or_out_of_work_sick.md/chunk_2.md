##  Introduction

You can get a refund of tax you have already paid if you:

  * Were employed and become unemployed 
  * Are out of work due to illness 

This page explains how to get a tax refund in these situations.

If you are employed and think you may have overpaid tax, read about [ PAYE
overpayments of tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/paye-overpayments-and-
underpayments-of-tax/) .
