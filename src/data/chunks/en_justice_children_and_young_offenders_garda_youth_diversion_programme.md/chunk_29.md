###  **Garda Youth Diversion Projects**

The Youth Diversion Programme is supported by a network of Garda Youth
Diversion Projects (GYDPs). The projects give the children opportunities to
engage in activities such as education, employment training, sport, art and
music. Most projects operate outside of school hours, although activities may
also be planned during the daytime.

The projects are community based, multi-agency youth crime prevention
initiatives that aim to divert young people from anti-social or criminal
behaviour.

There are over 100 projects managed by community-based organisations as part
of the programme. These include For√≥ige, Crosscare, Extern and other
independent agencies. You can find programme locations on [ this map.
