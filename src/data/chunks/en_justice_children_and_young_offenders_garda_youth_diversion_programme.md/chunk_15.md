###  Two types of caution

Two types of caution may be given to a child

  * Formal 
  * Informal 

The Director of the Programme decides whether to administer a formal or
informal caution. Generally, the decision depends on the seriousness of the
childâ€™s criminal behaviour.

Formal cautions are more serious than informal cautions.

If a child has previously been formally cautioned, they cannot be informally
cautioned on a later occasion.
