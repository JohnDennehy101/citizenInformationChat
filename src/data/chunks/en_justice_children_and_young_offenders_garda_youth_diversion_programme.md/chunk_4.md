###  **Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers (JLOs)**

The Diversion Programme is administered by specially trained Gardaí called
Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers (JLOs).

These Gardaí are specially trained to deal with:

  * Young people and their families in relation to crime-prevention 
  * The operation of the diversion programme 
  * All other areas involving young people and the criminal justice system. 

Each Garda Division in Ireland has JLOs who maintain informal contacts with
young people at risk. They also liaise with teachers, Tusla staff, school
attendance officers and other Gardaí in their local area.
