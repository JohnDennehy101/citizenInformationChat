##  Annual leave and other leave

In general, you are treated as being in employment while you are on:

  * Maternity leave or additional maternity leave 
  * Adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave 
  * Paternity leave 
  * Parental leave 
  * Parent’s leave 
  * Health and safety leave 

This means you can continue to build up your entitlement to annual leave.

You are entitled to annual leave for the first 13 weeks of carer’s leave.
