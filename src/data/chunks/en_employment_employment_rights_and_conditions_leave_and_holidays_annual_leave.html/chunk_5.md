###  Calculating your annual leave

There are **3 ways** to calculate your annual leave entitlement. You can use
whichever method gives you the _greater_ (biggest) entitlement:

**Method 1**

If you have worked at least 1,365 hours in a _leave year_ (see above), you are
entitled to the maximum of 4 working weeks' paid annual leave.

You cannot use this method if you changed employment during the leave year.

**Method 2**

Calculate 1/3 of a working week for each calendar month in which you worked at
least 117 hours.

**Method 3**

Calculate 8% of the hours you worked in the leave year, subject to a maximum
of 4 working weeks.

When calculating your holiday entitlement, your employer should include all
the hours you worked, **including** time spent on annual leave, maternity
leave, parental leave, force majeure leave, adoptive leave or the first 13
weeks of carerâ€™s leave.

If you have worked for at least 8 months, you are entitled to an _unbroken
period_ of 2 weeks' annual leave. This means you can get 2 weeks off in a row.
