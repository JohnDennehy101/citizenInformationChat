##  Making a complaint

If you think your holiday entitlement is wrong, try speaking informally to
your employer.

If you cannot resolve the problem informally, you can complain to the
Workplace Relations Commission.

You should apply using the WRC’s [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
. You must make your complaint **within 6 months** of the _dispute_
(disagreement) happening.

The time limit may be extended for a further 6 months, but only if you have a
‘reasonable cause’ which prevented you bringing your complaint within the
normal time limit.

redress/adjudication-employment-rights-disputes-and-complaints/) , including
details of the WRC adjudication process.
