##  Introduction

The National Archives of Ireland is where researchers and members of the
public can view original documents and records from departments of state, the
courts, public bodies as well as many private collections.

The documents held in the Archives help to provide an understanding of the
social, economic and political history of Ireland. The National Archives was
formed in 1988, when the Public Record Office (founded 1867, formerly at the
Four Courts) and the State Paper Office (founded 1702, formerly at Dublin
Castle) were merged to create a single institution.
