##  What does the National Archives do?

The functions of the National Archives include the following:

  * The preservation, restoration, arrangement and description of archives 
  * The preparation of guides, lists, indexes and other finding aids to archives 
  * Making archives available for public inspection 
  * Making and providing copies of archives 
  * The provision of educational services relating to archives 

Many of the archives held by the Public Record Office of Ireland before 1922
were destroyed by fire and explosion at the beginning of the Irish Civil War
in June 1922. Because of this, the archives that are now held by the National
Archives date mainly from the 19th and 20th centuries, although some date back
as far as the 13th century.
