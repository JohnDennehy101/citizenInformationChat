####  Changes to their circumstances

Joe has been offered some part-time work as a caretaker in a local school. If
he takes the job, his net weekly wage will be €260.

Jean is thinking of increasing the number of hours she works. Her new net
weekly income would be €206.

Joe wants to know how his State Pension (Non-Contributory) will be affected if
he starts work in the local school and Jean increases the number of days she
works.
