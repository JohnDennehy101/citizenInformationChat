If you are 65 or over, you do not have to pay income tax if your income is
below a certain amount called the exemption limit.

The exemption limit also applies if:

  * You are [ jointly assessed for tax ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/taxation-of-married-people/#0b1920)
