###  **Rent reviews outside of Rent Pressure Zones**

Your rent cannot be reviewed until 24 months after the start of your tenancy.
If your rent was reviewed at any time in the last 24 months, it cannot be
reviewed again until 24 months after the date of the last review. This rent
certainty measure is in place until 31 December 2024.

When the 24-month period is over your landlord must give you at least 90 daysâ€™
notice of a change in rent. This written notice must state the amount of the
new rent and date the new rent will take effect.

Your landlord cannot charge more than 'market rent' which is the going rate
for your type of accommodation in the area you live.
