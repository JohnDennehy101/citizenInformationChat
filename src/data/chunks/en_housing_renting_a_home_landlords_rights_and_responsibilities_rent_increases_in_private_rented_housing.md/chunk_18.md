##  Disputes about rent increases

The RTB deals with disputes between landlords and tenants about rent
increases. There are 2 stages to the RTB’s dispute resolution process. Stage 1
is confidential mediation or adjudication, and Stage 2 is an appeal of the
mediator’s or adjudicator’s decision, which is a public hearing by a 3-person
Tenancy Tribunal. For more information see our document [ resolving disputes
between landlords and tenants ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-
disputes/disputes-between-landlords-and-tenants/) .

The RTB can also investigate and sanction landlords who do not comply with RPZ
rules. See the [ RTB’s website ](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-
compliance/investigations-sanctions) for more information about what can be
investigated and how to make a complaint.
