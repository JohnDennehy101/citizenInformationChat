###  Notice of rent review

Once the required period (12 or 24 months) has elapsed, your landlord can
issue a notice of rent review.

The landlord must give you proper notice of the amount of the proposed new
rent and the date from which it is to take effect. Landlords must use the [
RTB’s Notice of Rent Review Form (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/forms/Schedule_1_Notice_of_New_Rent_RTB_%28Revised_Dec_2021%29_Final_%282%29.pdf)
when issuing a rent review. Landlords should fill out the sections of the form
that are relevant to them and should not delete or change any of the form.
Other forms, emails, text messages and spoken messages are not valid forms of
notice.

You must get at least 90 days’ notice of a rent review. This means that the
new rent cannot apply until 90 days after the notice has been issued.

The landlord must also notify the RTB of the revised rent so that it can
update the registration details of the tenancy. The landlord can do this
online using the [ RTB’s online account system ](https://www.rtb.ie/portal) ,
or by completing the RTB’s [ Tenancy Update Form (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/forms/Upload_-
_RTB_form_Tenancy_Update_\(s139\)_30.03.2022.pdf) and returning it to the RTB.
The form can be emailed to [ registrations@rtb.ie
](mailto:registrations@rtb.ie) , or posted to the RTB. There is no fee for
updating this information with the RTB. The [ RTB’s website has more
information about updating your tenancy details ](https://www.rtb.ie/register-
