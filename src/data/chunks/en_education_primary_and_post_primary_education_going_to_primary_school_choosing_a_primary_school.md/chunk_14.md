##  Applying to a school

You should apply to the school in writing. If they donâ€™t have an application
form, you can apply by letter or email.

All primary schools must publish an admissions notice and an admissions
policy.

The **admissions notice** tells you:

  * When the school will start accepting applications for the year (when to apply) 
  * When you will get the decision on your application 
  * When you must accept a place 

The **admissions policy** describes the rules the school will follow for
selecting students and how they make their decisions. It also states what
happens if the school is over-subscribed.
