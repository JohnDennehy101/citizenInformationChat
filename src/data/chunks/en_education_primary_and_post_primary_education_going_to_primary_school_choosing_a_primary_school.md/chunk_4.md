##  National primary schools

Many national primary schools are owned and supported by different churches.

National schools are funded by the State, so you don’t pay a fee.

They often use the initial letters below, along with the school’s name, to
describe themselves as a national school:

  * NS: National School 
  * GNS: Girls' National School 
  * BNS: Boys' National School 
  * SN: Scoil Naisiúnta 

Some schools use the Irish form of their name, such as ‘Scoil Bhríde NS’.
However, a school with an Irish name does not mean they teach through Irish.
