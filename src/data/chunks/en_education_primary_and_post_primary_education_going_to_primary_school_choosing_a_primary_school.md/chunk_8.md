###  **Multi-denominational and inter-denominational schools**

Many schools in Ireland are denominational (religious), focusing on one faith,
such as Roman Catholic or Protestant.

However, the Department of Education also [ supports multi-denominational and
inter-denominational schools (pdf) ](https://cns.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2022/11/FAQs-for-Parents.pdf) . These schools are funded by
the State and do not charge fees.

The difference between these schools is that:

  * **Multi-denominational schools** teach children about different religious views and belief systems equally 
  * **Inter-denominational schools** have a combined Catholic and Protestant ethos 

Multi-denominational and inter-denominational schools follow the national [
Primary School Curriculum ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/027ad-
primary-curriculum-framework/) . Children still learn the Irish language in
these schools.
