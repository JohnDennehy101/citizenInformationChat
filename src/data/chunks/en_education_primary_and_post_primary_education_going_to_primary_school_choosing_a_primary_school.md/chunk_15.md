###  Discrimination

Schools cannot discriminate if your child:

  * Has a disability 
  * Is of a different race 
  * Is a member of the Traveller community. 

They also cannot discriminate because of a childâ€™s:

  * Family status 
  * Sexual orientation 
  * Marital status 
  * Gender 
  * Religion. 

However, in some circumstances, a school can prioritise a student of a
minority religion if the family wants a school providing religious instruction
similar to that religion or belief.
