###  **No absolute right to silence or privilege against self-incrimination**

The right to silence and privilege against self-incrimination in Ireland is
not an absolute right, which means there are exceptional situations where it
does not apply.

However, in the majority of criminal offences this right applies. When you are
accused of a criminal offence, you have the right to silence unless you are
told by the Gardaí that the offence you are arrested for means you must give
information (see ‘Offence of not answering questions’ below). The Gardaí must
also tell you of the consequences if you fail to answer.

The fact that you exercised your right to silence while in custody should not
be referred to at any later trial.
