##  Consequences at trial of remaining silent

In certain circumstances, if you choose to be silent it may affect you
negatively as conclusions may be inferred or drawn from your silence.

There are 2 areas where the law in Ireland potentially affects your privilege
against self-incrimination and your right to silence:

  * Your failure to answer certain questions or to provide certain information can allow inferences to be drawn at your trial. For example, your failure to answer a question about why you were carrying a possible weapon or why you were at a particular place 

and

  * Offences where it is a criminal offence not to answer certain questions or to provide certain information for example, failure to answer questions on your knowledge of possible terrorist offences. 

It is important to note this can also apply to refusals to answer questions
even if you are not in custody.
