Your privilege against self-incrimination and your right to silence can be
affected if you fail to answer certain questions or to provide certain
information when asked certain questions under [ Section 52 of the Offences
Against the State Act 1939
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1939/act/13/section/52/enacted/en/html)
.

If you are detained under [ Section 30

of this Act, you must answer certain questions concerning your movements and
actions and your knowledge concerning the act of any offence under the Act.

Before asking for this information, the Garda must inform you that they are

of the consequences if you fail to or refuse to comply with the request, that
is, you are committing an offence. The Garda must explain this in clear,
