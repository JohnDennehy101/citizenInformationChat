##  What happens when my child reaches 16?

DCA stops when your child reaches 16, so your last DCA payment will be for the
month of their 16th birthday.

The Department of Social Protection will write to you 3 months before your
childâ€™s 16th birthday to remind you that DCA will soon stop and tell you about
the available options.
