###  **Medical criteria**

The law says to get Domiciliary Care Allowance, a child must have "a severe
disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention, substantially
in excess of the care and attention normally required by a child of the same
age".

This means your childâ€™s eligibility for DCA is not based on the type of
disability or illness they have, but on the level of care and attention they
need as a result. They must need this care and attention for daily living and
for at least 12 months.

The Department's Medical Assessor looks at the following information before
deciding on whether your child meets the medical criteria:

  * The history of the case 
  * All medical reports received (your GP fills out a medical report, and you should include reports from any relevant specialists) 
  * Your description of the care and attention needed by your child. (The application form lets you explain what extra care your child needs under a number of headings, such as personal care; communication; behaviour; safety; and sensory issues).
