####  **Child attends residential care**

You may get a half-rate DCA payment if your child is in residential care and
goes home for 2 days or more a week. For example, a child who attends
residential services from Monday to Friday and goes home at weekends.

Children who are being cared for on a full-time basis in residential homes or
other institutions are not eligible for DCA.
