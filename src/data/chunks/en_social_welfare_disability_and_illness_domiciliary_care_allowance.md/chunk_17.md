###  **Disability Allowance**

At age 16, your child can apply in their own right for [ Disability Allowance
(DA) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/disability-allowance/) . DA is a means-tested payment for people with
disabilities who, as a result of their disability, are substantially
restricted in undertaking work that would otherwise be suitable for a person
of their age, experience and qualifications.

The qualifying conditions for DA are different from the qualifying conditions
for DCA, so your child is not automatically entitled to DA because they were
getting DCA. The means test for Disability Allowance assesses the means of
your child, and your income is **not** taken into account.

Your child should apply a few months before they turn 16, to allow time for
their application to be processed.
