##  Changing or ending a co-decision-making agreement

You or your co-decision-maker can end all or part of the co-decision-making
agreement whenever you like. You can do this before or after it is registered
with the Decision Support Service.

To end a co-decision making agreement, you must:

  * Do this in writing 
  * Sign it in the presence of 2 witnesses 
  * Tell relevant people including your spouse or partner that the agreement has ended 

If the agreement is ended after it is registered, you must also notify the
Decision Support Service with:

  * The reasons for the ending of the agreement 
  * A statement by a doctor or another healthcare professional that you have capacity to end the agreement 
  * Details of the notice given to certain people of the agreement ending, including family members. 

The Decision Support Service will remove all or part of the agreement from the
register.
