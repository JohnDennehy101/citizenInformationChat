###  How to check if someone has a co-decision-making agreement

The Decision Support Service keeps a [ register of co-decision-making
agreements ](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/services/search-register) . The
agreement will say who the co-decision-maker is. Specific people and
organisations can apply to search the register if they have a good reason to
do so. This could include banks, lawyers or doctors. It might also include
family members and carers.

The Decision Support Service can provide a certified copy of your co-decision-
making agreement, which confirms that the agreement exists. The DSS also
provide [ template forms for making a co-decision making agreement
](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/resources/forms) .
