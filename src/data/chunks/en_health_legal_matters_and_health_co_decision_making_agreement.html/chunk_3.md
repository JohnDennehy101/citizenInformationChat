##  What can a co-decision-maker do?

Your co-decision-maker can make the decisions set out in the co-decision-
making agreement **together with you** .

Your co-decision-maker will help you to get relevant information and will
explain it to you. Together, you look at the information and talk about the
different options and outcomes. You can then jointly come to a decision that
respects your wishes.

After you register your co-decision-making agreement, your co-decision-maker
can:

  * Support you in coming to a decision together. For example, the co-decision-maker will try to explain complex information to you in clear and simple terms 
  * Help you to access relevant information and records, for example, contacting your bank or doctor 
  * Make certain decisions together with you, for example, decisions on your finances 
  * Make reasonable efforts to ensure any decision is implemented 

Your co-decision-maker can only support you with decisions listed in your
agreement

They cannot make a decision on your behalf without you â€“ you must always be
involved.
