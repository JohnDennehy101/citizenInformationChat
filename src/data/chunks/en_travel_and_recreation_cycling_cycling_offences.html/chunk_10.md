###  What are fixed charge offences?

Gardaí can stop cyclists and fine them for specific fixed charge cycling
offences. Gardaí can fine cyclists for the following offences:

  * No front or rear light during lighting-up hours 
  * Riding a bicycle without reasonable consideration 
  * Failing to stop for a school warden sign 
  * Failing to stop at traffic lights when the red lamp is lit 
  * Failing to stop at cycle traffic lights when the red lamp is lit 
  * Failing to stop at a stop line, barrier or half barrier at a railway level crossing, swing bridge, or lifting bridge, when the red lamps are flashing 
  * Cycling in a pedestrianised street or area 

The fine for these offences is €40. If you receive a fixed charge notice, you
have 28 days from the date of the issue of the fixed charge notice to pay the
fine. If it is not paid within 28 days, the charge is increased by 50%. If it
is not paid within 56 days, then court proceedings are initiated (and payment
will no longer be accepted).

If you misplace, lose or damage your fixed charge notice, you should contact
the Garda Fixed Charge Processing Office (see ‘Where to apply’ below). A re-
print of the notice will be sent to you by post. However, the time period
allowed for payment is not extended by your request for a re-print.

If you pay the fixed charge notice within the legal time limits and court
proceedings are not commenced, you will not have a criminal record regarding
the offence.

receive a fixed charge notice from An Garda Síochána, you can apply to have it
cancelled due to exceptional circumstances. See the [ guide to cancellations
