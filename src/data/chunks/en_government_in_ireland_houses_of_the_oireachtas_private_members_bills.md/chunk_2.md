##  Introduction

All proposals for new laws start life as Bills. The bill must be passed by [
the Dáil ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/)
and [ Seanad ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/)
(the two Houses of the Oireachtas – the Irish parliament) before the President
can sign the bill into law.

When it is signed by the President, the Bill becomes an Act and is added to
the Statute Book.

Bills are either commenced by a Minister of State (Government Bills) or by a
TD or Senator who is not part of the Government (Private Member’s Bills).
