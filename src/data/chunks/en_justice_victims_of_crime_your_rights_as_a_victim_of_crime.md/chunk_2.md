##  Introduction

Irish law defines a victim of crime as anyone who has suffered physical,
mental or emotional harm or economic loss which was directly caused by a
criminal offence. Family members are also victims if the death of their loved
one was directly caused by a criminal offence.

If you are a victim of crime, you may come into contact with government
agencies such as An Garda Síochána (the Irish police), the courts, the
Probation Service, and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). You have the
right to receive information in simple, accessible language that you can
understand when dealing with these agencies.

If you have special communication needs, these should be accommodated. If you
speak a language other than English, you should be provided with an
interpreter. You can also ask for written information to be translated so that
you can understand it.

Your rights as a victim of crime are most clearly set out in the [ Criminal
Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 (as amended) (pdf)
