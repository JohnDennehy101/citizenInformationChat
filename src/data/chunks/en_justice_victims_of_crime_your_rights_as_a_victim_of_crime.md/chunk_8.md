##  Can I get special protection or support?

While the Gardaí are investigating the case, they will decide whether you need
special supports or protections. When making their decision, they will
consider (among other things) your personal circumstances and the type and
circumstances of the crime.

For example, victims of certain crimes, such as human trafficking or violence
in close relationships, are more likely to need special protection. Victims
with a disability, or victims who have difficulty communicating, may also be
identified as needing special protections.

You should let the Gardaí know if you think you have any special protection
needs.

Some of the available special protections and supports include:

  * Conducting interviews in a more suitable location 
  * Interviews being conducted by someone with specialised training 
  * Forbidding the public from attending the [ trial ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) (though the press may still attend) 
  * Enabling a [ witness ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/witnesses/witnesses_introduction.en.html) to give evidence to the court from behind a screen or over a video link from a different room 

The Crime Victims Helpline has more information on the [ special protections
and supports ](https://crimevictimshelpline.ie/victims-rights/special-
protections) available.

If the victim of a crime is under 18 years of age, they are presumed to need
special protections. The Crime Victims Helpline has information on the [
protections and supports available to child victims
