##  What are my rights if the investigation is stopped, or nobody is
prosecuted?

Sometimes the Gardaí can decide to stop investigating a crime without
identifying a suspect, or the Gardaí or the [ Director of Public Prosecutions
(DPP) ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/director-of-public-prosecutions/) can
decide not to prosecute an identified suspect.

Where this happens, the Gardaí or the DPP will inform you of your right to
request a summary of the reasons for the decision, a review of the decision,
and the procedure for requesting a review.

Your request for a summary of reasons must be submitted within 28 days of
being informed of the decision. Your request for a review must be submitted
within 56 days of being informed of the decision, or within 28 days of the
date of the summary of reasons letter if you asked for this.

If the Gardaí made the decision, you can write directly to the Superintendent
or to the [ Garda Victim Service Office ](https://www.garda.ie/en/victim-
services/garda-victim-service/) . If you have asked for a review, this will be
carried out by a member of the Gardaí who was not involved in making the
original decision.

If the DPP made the decision, you can write to the Victim Liaison Unit at the
[ Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions
](https://www.dppireland.ie/victims-witnesses/) . If you have asked for a
review, this will be carried out by somebody who was not involved in making
the original decision.

The DPP website has more information on [ decisions not to prosecute
](https://www.dppireland.ie/victims-witnesses/decisions-not-to-procecute/) .
