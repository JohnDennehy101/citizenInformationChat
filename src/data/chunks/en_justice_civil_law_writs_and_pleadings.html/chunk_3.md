##  District Court cases

If the claimant wishes to _commence proceedings_ (that is, to start the legal
action) in the District Court, their solicitor prepares and serves a _claim
notice_ on the respondent.

The respondent (or their solicitor) then gives or sends to the claimant (or
their solicitor) an _appearance and defence_ to show that they intend to
defend the case.

If the respondent believes that they actually have a claim against the
claimant, the respondent includes in the appearance and defence a _statement
of counterclaim_ setting out their claim against the claimant.
