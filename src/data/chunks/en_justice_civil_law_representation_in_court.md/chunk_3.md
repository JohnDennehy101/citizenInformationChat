##  Solicitors

As well as representing people involved in litigation, solicitors provide
services that are not connected with court proceedings. For example, a
solicitor may assist you in the preparation and formalisation of your will or
with the legal transfer of your property (conveyancing).

Solicitors can advertise their services. They deal with the public, take
instructions from clients, do the necessary background work on cases, give
preliminary advice, obtain expert or specialist opinion if necessary and
instruct barristers if required.

The solicitor prepares the case for the trial. They may represent you in court
but will usually instruct a barrister to represent you in the higher courts.
This is done by sending the barrister a brief containing all the relevant
information and documentation to assist them in the presentation of the case.
