##  Payment for jury service

You are not paid for jury service and travelling expenses are not allowed. If
you are actually serving as a juror, lunch will be provided on the day or days
of the trial.

If you are self-employed and work alone and your attendance at jury service
means you cannot earn a living, you may qualify to be excused from jury
service. Contact the jury office of the court for more information.

If you are signing on for a Jobseeker's payment you will continue to be paid,
but you should advise your local social welfare office that you have been
called for jury service.

If you are in employment, your employer must let you attend jury service. Time
spent on jury service should be treated as if the employee were actually
employed. In other words, if you are in employment and are attending for jury
service, you are entitled to be paid while you are away from work. If you have
a contract of employment, for example, (temporary workers or contract workers)
you are entitled to be paid by your employer while you are on jury service.
There should also be no loss of any other employment rights while you serve on
a jury. You can request a certificate from the jury office to confirm your
attendance at jury service.

If you feel your employment rights have been infringed or you have lost
employment rights while serving on a jury, you can make a complaint to the
Workplace Relations Commission using the online complaint form available on [
workplacerelations.ie
