###  Other situations when you can be excused from jury service

You can also be excused from jury service in other situations, for example:

  * The County Registrar or the trial judge can excuse you if they are satisfied that there is 'good reason' to do so 
  * At the end of a case of 'an exceptionally exacting nature', the trial judge can excuse the jury from jury service for as long as they consider suitable
