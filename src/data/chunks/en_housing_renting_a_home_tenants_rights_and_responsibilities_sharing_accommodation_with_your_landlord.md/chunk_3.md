##  Self-contained flat or apartment

If you are renting a self-contained flat or apartment in your landlord’s home,
your tenancy is covered by residential tenancies legislation.

Examples of a self-contained flat or apartment include a basement flat or
converted garage, which is attached to your landlord’s home. This type of
accommodation is covered by residential tenancies legislation.

You have certain rights and obligations under residential tenancies
legislation and so does your landlord.

If the flat or apartment was originally part of the main house, your landlord
must [ register the tenancy ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-
responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) . However, your landlord can choose
to opt out of [ security of tenure ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-
rights-and-responsibilities/types-of-tenancy/) rules, which give you the right
to stay in your rented accommodation for a set amount of time. You must get
notice in writing, before the start of the tenancy, if the landlord wants to
take this option.
