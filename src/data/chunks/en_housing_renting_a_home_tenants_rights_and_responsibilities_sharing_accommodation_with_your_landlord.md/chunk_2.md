##  Introduction

If you are renting a self-contained flat or apartment in your landlordâ€™s home,
your tenancy is covered by residential tenancies legislation and your landlord
must [ register it with the Residential Tenancies Board ](/en/housing/renting-
a-home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) .
However, if you are renting a room that is part of your landlord's home, your
tenancy is not covered by this legislation.

Your landlord may be entitled to [ Rent-a-room relief ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/home-owners/renting-a-room-in-your-home/) , whether you are renting a
room or a self-contained unit. Rent-a-room relief does not apply if you are [
renting a property for short-term lets ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/renting-your-property-for-shortterm-lets/) .

You may be entitled to claim the [ Housing Assistance Payment
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/) or
[ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-
supplement/) in the same way as other tenants. As part of the qualifying
conditions for these supports you must be able to prove that the tenancy is
genuine.
