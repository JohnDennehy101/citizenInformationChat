####  **Supports to access ECCE**

The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) helps children with disabilities to
benefit from quality early learning and care and to access the [ ECCE
programme ](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-childcare/early-childhood-
care-and-education-scheme/) .

When you have identified a pre-school for your child, your service provider,
in consultation with you, will consider what supports may be needed to ensure
your childâ€™s participation in pre-school.

Where it is considered that your child needs additional support, your pre-
school service provider can apply, in partnership with you, for targeted
supports under AIM.

The [ AIM website ](https://aim.gov.ie/) provides [ information for parents
](https://aim.gov.ie/parents/) and [ frequently asked questions
](http://www.preschoolaccess.ie/faqs/) on supports available. Your local City
or County Childcare Committee will also be able to provide you with
information and guidance on AIM.
