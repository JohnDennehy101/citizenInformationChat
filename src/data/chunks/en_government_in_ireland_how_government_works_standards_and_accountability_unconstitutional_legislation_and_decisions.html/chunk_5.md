##  How to apply

If you wish to begin judicial proceedings, you should contact a [ solicitor
](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) who will in turn brief a [ barrister
](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) to draft the papers for the case. It is
also possible for you to represent yourself if you wish to keep your legal
costs down.

There is no fixed rate of charges for legal fees so you should obtain some
quotes before deciding on legal representation. Your solicitor must advise you
in writing of the [ fees you will be charged ](/en/justice/civil-law/legal-
fees-and-costs-for-civil-cases/) for their services. If it is not possible to
give you a definite sum, they must estimate a sum or at the very least
describe the basis upon which charges or fees will be calculated.
