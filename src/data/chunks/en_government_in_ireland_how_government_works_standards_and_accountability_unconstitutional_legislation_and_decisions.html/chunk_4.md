##  Judicial proceedings

The [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) has the power or
_jurisdiction_ to cancel any law or part of any law that is repugnant to the
Constitution. This means that if you believe that a law breaches the
Constitution or your fundamental rights, you may bring proceedings in the High
Court. The constitutionality of an Act that has not yet commenced may be
challenged where an order commencing it could be made at any time. Notice of
the proceedings must be served on the [ Attorney General ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/the-attorney-general/) .

In order to challenge the constitutionality of legislation, you must show that
you have "sufficient interest" in the proceedings, that is, that the
legislation affects you in some real way. You must also show that you have an
arguable case, that is, that your case has grounds.

The High Court will examine the legislation in question and decide whether or
not it conflicts with the Constitution. If it decides that the legislation
does conflict with the Constitution, it may annul or cancel the law or the
part of it that is unconstitutional.

The High Courtâ€™s decision may be appealed to the Court of Appeal or the
Supreme Court.
