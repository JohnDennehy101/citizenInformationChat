###  Level of Subvention

No new applications for the subvention scheme were accepted after the
introduction of the NHSS on 27 October 2009 when the maximum weekly subvention
rate was â‚¬300.

If your means are less than the weekly rate of the State Pension (Non-
contributory) payable at the time, the HSE may pay an extra subvention. If
your only income is a State Pension (Non-contributory), your means are
assessed, not at the full amount of your pension, but after a sum equivalent
to one fifth of the State Pension (Non-contributory) is disregarded. So, you
will be able to get higher than the maximum subvention.

If your means are higher than the rate of State Pension (Non-contributory)
payable at the time, plus 20% retained for personal use, the subvention may be
reduced by the amount of the excess.
