###  Assets

The following assets may be taken into account:

  * House property (excluding household furniture and goods) 
  * Stocks, shares or securities 
  * Money on hand, in trust, lodged, deposited or invested 
  * Interests in a company or business of any kind (including a farm) 
  * Interest in land 
  * Life assurance or endowment policies 
  * Valuables held as investments 
  * Current value of equipment of a business or machinery, excluding a car, not covered under a previous heading. 

If you disposed of any assets in the previous 5 years, the value of those
assets may also be taken into account. That value may include the value of
benefit and privilege arising from the transfer.

If a business was transferred without any agreement on benefit and privilege,
the Health Service Executive (HSE) may take into account any payment on
transfer or may impute a notional value of 5% of the market value on the date
of transfer, whichever is the higher.

In the case of a farm transfer, the HSE may take into account any payment on
transfer or any continuing income from the earnings of the farm.

The first â‚¬11,000 of any assets is not taken into account.
