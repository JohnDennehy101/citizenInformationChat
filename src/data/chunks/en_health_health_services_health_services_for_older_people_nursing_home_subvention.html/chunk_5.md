###  Farm or business income

Farm, Land or a Business is assessed where the applicant for subvention owns
or has legal interest in the Farm, Land or Business.

The income from a farm or business is calculated on the basis of the previous
year's accounts if they are available. If they are not, a notional assessment
is made of the income.

In the case of a farm where there is an income but where accounts are not
available for the previous financial year the total farm income, including
headage payments, grants, rental income, etc. will be assessed, less current
farm expenditure.

Where the farm or business is not being used, a notional income may be
assessed, as above, but which also takes account of the capital value of the
land or business.
