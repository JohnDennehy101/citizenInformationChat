###  Your home

Your principal private residence is not taken into account if it is occupied
immediately before the application and continues to be occupied by your
spouse, child aged under 21 or in full-time education or relative in receipt
of [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/disability-allowance/) , [ Blind Person's Pension ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-pension/) , [ Illness Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/) , [ Invalidity
Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/) or [
State Pension (Non Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/state-pension-non-contributory/) .

To assess the notional annual income of your house, the HSE takes 5% of the
estimated market value if it was not occupied before or at the time of the
application by one of the people listed. This is calculated net of mortgage,
loan rental or purchase repayments. The HSE can only assess the value of your
home for a total of three years.
