##  How the Government is formed

After a [ general election ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/the-general-election/) , the [
D치il ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) (the
Irish parliament) elects the Taoiseach. Normally the Taoiseach is the leader
of the largest party in the Dail. If no one party has a majority of TDs
(members of the D치il), a number of parties may come together to form a
coalition government.

The Taoiseach then nominates a deputy (the T치naiste) and a cabinet of
ministers who take charge of the departments of government.

The acting Taoiseach (the Taoiseach of the former Government) may have to ask
[ the President ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/president-introduction-to-the-president-of-ireland/) to dissolve
the D치il and call another general election if no Government can be formed.
