##  Can I work?

Many people over the standard retirement age of 65 continue working past this
age.

If you are [ working in retirement ](/en/employment/retirement/older-people-
and-working/working-in-retirement/) , you have the same employment rights as
everyone else. If you decide to work part-time, you can read about [
employment rights of part-time workers ](/en/employment/types-of-
employment/rights-of-part-time-workers/) .

If you are under age 66, you may be able to do some part-time work and keep
your entitlement to part of your [ Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-
welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) or [ Jobseeker's Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) . If you are
getting any social welfare payment other than the [ State Pension
(Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-
contributory/) or [ Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's
(Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-
contrib-pension/) Pension, working can affect your entitlement.
