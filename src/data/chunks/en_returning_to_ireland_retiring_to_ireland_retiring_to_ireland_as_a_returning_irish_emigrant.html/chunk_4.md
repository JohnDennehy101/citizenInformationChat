##  What is retirement age in Ireland?

There is no fixed retirement age for people in Ireland. However, if you are an
employee, your retirement age will be set out in your contract of employment.
The usual retirement age in contracts of employment is 65.

To claim an Irish state pension, you must be aged 66 or over. For more
