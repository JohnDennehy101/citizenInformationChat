###  Vaccinations

The decision to get a vaccination against COVID-19 **is voluntary** .
Therefore you can make your own decision about whether or not to get a
vaccination.

**Telling your employer your vaccination status**

In most cases, you do not have to tell your employer whether or not you are
vaccinated. The Work Safely Protocol does not currently require employers to
collect any information regarding vaccination status. The Data Protection
Commission confirms this in its [ guidance on processing vaccination data
