###  If an employee has symptoms of COVID-19

If an employee has symptoms of COVID-19 during work hours, your employer must
have a designated isolation area for employees and should follow a specific
procedure:

  * The case manager or designated contact person must direct the person to a designated isolation area, along a designated route (make provisions for one or more persons displaying symptoms such as an additional isolation area or have contingency plans in place) 
  * Provide a well-fitted [ medical grade or respirator face mask ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/preventing-the-spread/when-to-wear-face-covering/) for the person presenting with symptoms. The worker should wear the mask if in a common area with other people or while exiting the premises 
  * Arrange for the employee to stay in isolation before arranging for them to be transported home, or to a medical facility, public transport should not be used. 
  * Arrange for appropriate cleaning of the isolation area and work areas 
  * Carry out a full risk assessment of the incident to see what, if any, further action needs to be taken
