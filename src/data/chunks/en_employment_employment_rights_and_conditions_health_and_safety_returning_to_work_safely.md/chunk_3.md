###  Guidance for employers on the return to work

This page summarises the work safely protocol published by the HSA, the HSE,
the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
Employment.

The latest work safely protocol (the Transitional Protocol) was issued on 31
January 2022. It reflects the Government announcement on the easing of public
health measures and places a greater emphasis on supporting the safe return to
physical attendance in the workplace.

The Transitional Protocol:

  * Describes the steps that employers and employees should take before a workplace reopens to make sure they can return to work safely 
  * Sets out infection prevention and control measures to allow a safe return and a continued safe operation of the workplace
