###  At risk workers

For some workers, the risks from COVID-19 infection are higher. There are two
levels of higher risk â€“ very high risk (extremely vulnerable) and high risk.
There is different public health advice for each of these groups. Employers
should take account of the particular need of workers in the high or very high
risk category.

A fitness for work medical risk assessment may need to be completed before at
risk workers return to the physical workplace.
