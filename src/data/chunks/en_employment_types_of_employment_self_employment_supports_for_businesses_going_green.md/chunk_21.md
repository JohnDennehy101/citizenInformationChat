###  End-of-life company car or light commercial vehicle

If you have a company car or a light commercial vehicle (of less than 3.5
tonnes) that is due to be disposed of or scrapped, it is called an _end-of-
life vehicle_ (ELV).

You must dispose of an end-of-life vehicle using licensed _authorised
treatment facilities_ (ATFs, also called _permitted scrapyards_ ). This is
because end of life vehicles contain hazardous materials that can damage the
environment and pose a risk to public health if not disposed of safely. For
example, vehicles contain lead acid batteries, lubricating oil, coolant, brake
fluid, and catalytic convertors.
