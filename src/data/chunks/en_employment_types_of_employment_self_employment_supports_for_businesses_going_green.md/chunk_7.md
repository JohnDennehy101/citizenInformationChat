###  Accelerated Capital Allowance

Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA) is a tax incentive scheme. It allows a
sole trader, farmer or company that pays corporation tax in Ireland to deduct
the full cost of energy-efficient equipment from their profits in the year of
purchase.

You must buy the new equipment for use in your trade. You cannot lease, let,
or hire the equipment to anyone else.

In order to qualify for this scheme, you must make sure the equipment you buy
is included in the SEAIâ€™s [ list of energy-efficient equipment
](https://triplee.seai.ie/AcaProducts/Search.aspx) .
