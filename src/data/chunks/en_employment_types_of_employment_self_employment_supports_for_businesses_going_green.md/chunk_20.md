###  Waste electronic equipment

You can recycle waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) for
free.

**Small electronic items, like household items**

Bring small electronic items, such as computers, desktop printers and
batteries (and other electrical items often found in a household) to your
local civic amenity site. Here it will be collected for recycling instead of
being sent to a landfill. [ Contact your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) for more
information, or find your nearest recycling point using the [ WEEE Ireland map
](https://www.weeeireland.ie/household-recycling/where-can-i-recycle/) .

You can also bring WEEE to a local electrical retailer. Retailers must take
back your old electrical equipment, for free, on a one-for-one, like-for-like
basis. This means the old product must be of the same type (or have the same
purpose) as the new item purchased.

**Larger electronic equipment**

You can correctly dispose of larger electronic equipment, such as
photocopiers, servers, cash registers or vending machines, by contacting your
equipment supplier or a local licenced waste contractor.
