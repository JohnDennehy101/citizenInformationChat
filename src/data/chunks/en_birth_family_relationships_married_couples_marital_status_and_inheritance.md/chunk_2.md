##  Introduction

When your partner dies, your inheritance rights will depend on whether or not
you were married to each other (or in a civil partnership).

This page explains your rights to **spousal inheritance** , as well as the
rules regarding your childrenâ€™s inheritance.

If you were not married or in a civil partnership, but you were cohabiting
(living together) you will only automatically inherit from your partner if
they left a bequest to you in a valid will. Read more about [ the inheritance
rights of cohabiting couples ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-
couples/inheritance-rights-cohabiting-couples/) .

For information on how civil partnership affects your right to inherit, read [
civil partnership and inheritance ](/en/birth-family-relationships/civil-
partnerships/civil-partnership-and-inheritance/) .
