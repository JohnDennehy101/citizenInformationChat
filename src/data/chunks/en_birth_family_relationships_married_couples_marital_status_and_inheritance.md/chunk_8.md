###  Legal separation

If you and your spouse have a formal separation agreement, you may have
already renounced or disclaimed (given up) your [ succession rights
](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/succession/) .

Similarly, if the court granted you a decree of judicial separation, your
succession rights will be extinguished (ended) if an order stating this is
made by the court.

If you are unsure about your [ succession rights ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/succession/) following separation,
contact your solicitor for advice.
