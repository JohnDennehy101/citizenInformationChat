##  Residential tenancies legislation

The Residential Tenancies Acts deal with the regulation of the mainstream
private rented housing sector, the approved housing body sector and student-
specific accommodation. The Acts set out the rights and obligations of both [
landlords ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-
responsibilities/landlords-rights-and-obligations/) and [ tenants
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/tenants-
rights-and-obligations/) in these sectors. They do not apply to certain types
of rented property.
