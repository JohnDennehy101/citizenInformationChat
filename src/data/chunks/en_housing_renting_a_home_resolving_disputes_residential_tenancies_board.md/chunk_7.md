###  Dispute resolution

The RTB provides a confidential dispute resolution service. You can start the
dispute resolution process if you are a tenant, a landlord or are otherwise
directly affected by a problem (for example, if you are a neighbour). A
landlord who has not registered the tenancy with the RTB cannot use the
dispute resolution service, but their tenant can use it.
