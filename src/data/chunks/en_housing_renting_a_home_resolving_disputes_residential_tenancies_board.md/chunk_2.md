##  What is the Residential Tenancies Board?

The Residential Tenancies Board was set up under the [ Residential Tenancies
Act 2004 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/enacted/en/html) to
regulate the private rented sector.

It was initially called the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) but its
name was changed to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), when [ approved
housing bodies (AHBs) ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) were brought under its remit in 2015 by the
[ Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/html) .

In 2019 [ student-specific accommodation ](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-
and-compliance/registrations/student-specific-accommodation) also came under
the remit of the RTB. This means that tenants in student-specific
accommodation have most of the same rights as private tenants. This change was
brought in under the [ Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/act/14/enacted/en/html) .

The RTB's main functions are to:

  * Maintain a register of private residential tenancies, tenancies of approved housing bodies and student-specific accommodation tenancies 
  * Provide a dispute resolution service for tenants and landlords 
  * Carry out research into the private rented sector 
  * Provide policy advice to the Government on the private rented sector
