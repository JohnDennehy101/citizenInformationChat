###  Investigation and sanction of landlords

The RTB has an [ investigations and sanctions unit
](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-compliance/investigations-sanctions) ,
which has the power to:

  * Investigate landlords who have broken residential tenancies legislation, for example, if they don’t register their tenancies or comply with Rent Pressure Zones rules 
  * Caution or sanction landlords with a fine of up to €15,000 if they do not meet their obligations as a landlord 

The RTB uses these powers to monitor and enforce the legislation, particularly
in relation to Rent Pressure Zones and termination of tenancy notices. These
additional powers were brought in under the [ Residential Tenancies
(Amendment) Act 2019
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/act/14/enacted/en/html) .
