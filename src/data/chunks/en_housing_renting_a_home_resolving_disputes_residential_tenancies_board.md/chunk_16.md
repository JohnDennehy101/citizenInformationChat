##  Where to make a complaint about the RTB

If you are unhappy with the service provided by the RTB you can contact them
to make a formal complaint. You should:

  * Make the complaint as soon as possible after the issue has happened 
  * Provide as much information as possible 

Your complaint will be reviewed by someone in the RTB who was not involved in
the original issue. The RTB aim to deal with complaints within 14 days. If
this is not possible they will contact you to let you know it will take
longer. The [ RTB’s Customer Charter ](https://www.rtb.ie/about-
rtb/governance/customer-charter) has more information about their complaints
procedure.

The RTB’s complaints procedure does not cover all types of complaints about
the RTB. For example, there is a different process for complaints or appeals
about RTB Adjudication or Tribunal Determinations. The [ RTB’s Customer
Charter ](https://www.rtb.ie/about-rtb/governance/customer-charter) has more
information on this.
