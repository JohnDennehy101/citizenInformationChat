###  Types of rented property that are exempt from residential tenancies
legislation

The Residential Tenancies Acts **do not apply** to the following types of
rented property:

  * Business lettings 
  * Holiday lettings 
  * Formerly rent-controlled properties or long occupation lease tenancies (separate legislation applies to them) 
  * [ A **room** that you rent in your landlord's home ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/sharing-accommodation-with-your-landlord/)
  * A property where the landlord's spouse, parent or child lives. This applies to informal family arrangements where there is no tenancy agreement in writing. However, the Act does cover formal agreements between family members, for example where a lease has been signed 
  * [ Local authority housing ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/)

**Part 4 of the 2004 Act** (which deals with [ security of tenure
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/types-of-
tenancy/) ) does not apply to:

  * Employment-related lettings â€“ these are sometimes called 'tied' houses in that they are tied to the job and you must leave the property when the job ends, and 
  * Student-specific accommodation 
  * Transitional properties let by approved housing bodies 

Also, if you are renting a flat or apartment that was originally part of the
landlord's main house, your landlord can choose to opt out of the Part 4
provisions on security of tenure. Read more in our page on [ Sharing
accommodation with your landlord ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
