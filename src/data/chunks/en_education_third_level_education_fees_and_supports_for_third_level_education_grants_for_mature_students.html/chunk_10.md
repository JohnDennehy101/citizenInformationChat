###  **Student Assistance Fund**

The [ Student Assistance Fund ](http://hea.ie/funding-governance-
performance/funding/student-finance/student-assistance-fund/) is for full-time
or part-time students who are experiencing financial difficulties and may be
unable to continue their studies. Students can apply for the Student
Assistance Fund to help with either temporary or ongoing financial
difficulties.

It can help with costs like books, rent, food, childcare, essential travel,
and utility and medical bills. It does not cover tuition or college
registration fees or student loan repayments.

You can apply for funding through the access or student services office in
your college. It is important to apply as soon as you can. Some colleges have
a closing date for applications and you should check when this is.

The Student Assistance Fund is administered on a strictly confidential basis
by your college.
