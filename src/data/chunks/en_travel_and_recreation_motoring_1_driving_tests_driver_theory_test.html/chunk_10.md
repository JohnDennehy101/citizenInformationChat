##  How the test works

The test is computer based and can be taken using either a touch screen or a
mouse and keyboard. You do not need to be computer literate to take the test.

The first part of the exam is a short tutorial, which includes instructions on
how to navigate through the exam. It also lets you practice answering 2
questions.

The format of the test is multiple choice questions. Answers are marked with a
square box beside them and you tick one to choose your answer.

If you make a mistake or change your mind, you can cancel your answer. You can
skip a question if you like, and go back and answer it at the end of your
test. Before you finish the exam, you can review all your answers and change
them.

The [ RSA has published a video to illustrate what you can expect on the day
of your theory test ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXALrEep8LU) .
