##  Introduction

Most children in Ireland start their first-level education in primary school
(also called _national school)_ at the age of 4 or 5 years of age. Legally,
children can be enrolled at primary school from the age of 4 upwards and must
start their formal education by the age of 6 years.

The primary school cycle is 8 years long. Schools generally have 2 years of
infant classes - junior and senior infants - followed by class 1 to class 6.

There are different types of primary schools in Ireland. All schools have a [
patron ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-primary-
school/ownership-of-primary-schools/) who sets the ethos of the school. The
patron may be a religious order. There are denominational schools, multi-
denominational schools, Irish-speaking schools (called _Gaelscoileanna_ ),
special schools and non-State-aided private primary schools.

Education in State primary schools is free of charge. The current and capital
costs of primary schools, including teachers' salaries, are funded mainly by
the Government and supplemented by local contributions.
