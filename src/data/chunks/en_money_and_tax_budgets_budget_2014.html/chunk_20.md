###  Invalidity Pension

The higher weekly Invalidity Pension rate of €230.30 paid when claimants reach
age 65 will be discontinued. The rate payable to people aged 65 (and under)
will be €193.50 per week. It will apply to people claiming Invalidity Pension
who reach their 65th birthday from 2 January 2014. Existing 65 year olds are
unaffected. This measure is being undertaken in line with the abolition of the
State Pension (Transition) from January 2014.

People who are getting Invalidity Pension (existing and new recipients) will
continue to be automatically transferred to State Pension (Contributory) at
age 66 and they will receive a weekly rate of €230.30.

The weekly rate payable to all qualified adults of people claiming Invalidity
Pension will be standardised at €138.10 per week. This measure will apply to
spouses and partners aged 66 or over who reach their 66th birthday from 2
January 2014. Existing spouses and partners aged 66 and over are unaffected.
