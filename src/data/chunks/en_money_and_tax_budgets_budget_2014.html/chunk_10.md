###  Jobseeker’s Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance

From 14 January 2014 people without children getting Jobseeker’s Allowance who
are aged between 18 and 24 years will receive €100 per week. Existing
claimants aged between 18 and 24 on a higher rate will have no change in their
rate. This provision applies to Supplementary Welfare Allowance recipients
from 9 January.

From 14 January 2014 people without children getting Jobseeker’s Allowance
aged 25 years will receive €144 a week. Existing claimants aged 25 on a higher
rate will have no change in their rate. This weekly €144 rate will increase to
€188 when they reach 26 years of age. This provision applies to Supplementary
Welfare Allowance recipients from 9 January.

From 14 January 2014 these reduced rates of Jobseeker’s Allowance will apply
to people aged 25 and under who have exhausted their entitlement to
Jobseeker’s Benefit.

Currently, all Jobseeker's Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance
recipients, regardless of age, who have children continue to receive a
personal rate of €188 (JA) or €186 (SWA) per week and an increase for a
qualified adult, if applicable, of €124.80 plus qualified child increases.
There are no changes to those arrangements.

The HSE care provision for people getting JA is also extended to age 24 (from
21). So, for example, a person aged 20 who is in receipt of a JA rate of €188
because they were in the care of the HSE during their 17th year can remain on
this rate up to age 24.
