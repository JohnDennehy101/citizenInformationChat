###  **Can I work part-time?**

While you cannot work full-time, you may work part-time.

If you are getting BTEA and start work during the academic year, you will be
assessed under the rules that apply to your primary payment (see ‘Qualifying
social welfare payments for BTEA’ above). This includes the [ means test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) , and applies to
new applicants and people returning to BTEA after a break.

If you qualify for BTEA from a jobseeker’s payment, you can work any number of
days each week during the academic year. However, you must still meet the
other conditions of your primary payment (for example, you must pass a [ means
test if you get Jobseeker’s Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test-for-jobseekers-
allowance/) ).
