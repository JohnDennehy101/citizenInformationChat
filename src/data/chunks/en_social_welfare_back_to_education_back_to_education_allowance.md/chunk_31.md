###  **Make an appeal**

The Back to Education Allowance is a non-statutory scheme. This means you
cannot appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

However, if you are not satisfied with a decision, you can request a review by
an officer in the relevant social welfare office or section. You should
include any new evidence to support the review. You must do this in writing
within 21 days.
