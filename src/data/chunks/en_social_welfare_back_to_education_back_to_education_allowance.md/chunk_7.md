####  **Undergraduate courses**

In general, you must be starting your Higher Level Education course at year
one. However, you may be eligible for BTEA if you:

  * Are exempt from part of your course because of a qualification you received in a previous course (for example, you have a higher certificate in a course that you now wish to take to degree level) 
  * Completed a year (or years) of your course as a part-time student 
  * Completed earlier years before becoming unemployed or receiving statutory redundancy 
  * Are permitted by your school or college to proceed to the next year of a course having dropped out or deferred a year (due to [ mitigating circumstances ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/5afe0f-operational-guidelines-back-to-education-allowance/#study-options:~:text=the%20summer%20period.-,Definition%20of%20Mitigating%20Circumstances,-Mitigating%20circumstances%20can) ) 
  * Were getting a [ One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) while in full-time education and were affected by age-related changes to OFP (you may get BTEA in the middle of your course if you are affected by this) 

If you defer a year of study, you are treated as a new entrant when you return
to your course.
