###  **What if my course is overseas?**

In general, you can only get BTEA for approved courses that start in Ireland
or in Northern Ireland. However, you can get BTEA for a year abroad (for
example, under the [ Erasmus+ programme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/european-education-
programmes/eramus-plus/) ) if the year is an integral or mandatory part of
your course. This must be verified by the registrar or admissions office of
your college.
