####  **Postgraduate courses**

If you hold a Level 7 ordinary degree, you can apply for a one year add-on
honours degree, which may be in a different discipline. You cannot get BTEA
for a new Level 8 degree course.

In limited circumstances, you may get BTEA for a postgraduate course. You may
get BTEA for:

  * A Level 8 Higher Diploma (H. Dip.) in any discipline 
  * A Level 9 Professional Masters in Education (PME) for post-primary teaching 
  * A Level 9 Masters degree where you donâ€™t have a third level qualification and the college has admitted you based on relevant life experience 

You cannot get BTEA if you already have a postgraduate qualification, unless
it is a [ Springboard+ course
