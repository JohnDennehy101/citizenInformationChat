##  What is the Back to Education Allowance?

You can take part in a Further Education or Higher Education course and get a
Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) if you:

  * Are unemployed 
  * Are parenting alone, or 
  * Have a disability and are getting certain payments from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) 

If you want to do other courses not covered under the BTEA (such as a personal
development or training course), you may return to education under the:

  * [ Part-Time Education option ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/part-time-education-option/)
