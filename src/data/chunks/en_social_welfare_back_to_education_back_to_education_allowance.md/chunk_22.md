###  **Can I get BTEA while on another social welfare scheme?**

If you get a Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), you cannot work full-time or
be involved in the following schemes:

  * [ Community Employment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/)
  * [ TÃºs ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/tus/)
  * [ Rural Social Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/farming-and-fishing/rural-social-scheme/)
  * [ Part-time Job Incentive Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/part-time-job-incentive-scheme/)
  * [ JobsPlus ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/jobsplus/)
  * [ Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-and-disability/wage-subsidy-scheme-for-people-with-disabilities/)
  * [ Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-support-schemes/work-placement-experience-programme/)
