##  Can I get the BTEA and the Student Grant Scheme?

The [ Student Grant Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/fees-
and-supports-for-third-level-education/student-grant-scheme/) is divided into
2 parts: maintenance grants and fee grants.

You cannot get the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) and the maintenance part
of a student grant together.

While you canâ€™t get the maintenance part of the student grant, you must still
submit a student grant application form to be assessed for a fee grant. The
fee grant can be used to pay your Student Contribution, field trip costs and
tuition fees (if payable).
