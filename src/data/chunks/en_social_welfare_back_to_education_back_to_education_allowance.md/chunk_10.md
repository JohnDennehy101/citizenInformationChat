###  **Other social welfare payments**

If you are getting one of the following payments, you can choose to either
transfer from your current social welfare payment to BTEA, or stay on your
current social welfare payment and apply for a student grant:

  * [ One-Parent Family Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/)
  * [ Jobseekerâ€™s Transitional Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/)
  * [ Disability Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
  * [ Invalidity Pension ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/) , or 
  * [ Illness Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/)

You can choose whichever option benefits you most.

In general, people who are studying full-time cannot get Rent Supplement
unless they are getting BTEA.
