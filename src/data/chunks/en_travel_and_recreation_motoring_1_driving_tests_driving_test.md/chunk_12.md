##  Appealing your test result

If you are not satisfied with the results of your driving test, [ it is
possible to appeal ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/the-driving-
test/repeating-your-test) . Appeals against driving test results are [ heard
in the District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) by a judge
sitting alone, without a jury.

To begin appeal proceedings, you must lodge your appeal with your local [
District Court Office ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) for [ a fee of â‚¬25 ](https://www.courts.ie/district-
court-fees) .

No financial compensation is available in driving test appeal cases. You will
not get any compensation for any costs associated with either failing your
test or in taking the appeal. A District Court judge can only make one of two
decisions in a driving test appeal case:

  * Your appeal is refused. The judge agrees with the decision of the driving tester that you failed your test. 

Or

  * Your appeal is upheld. The judge is satisfied that your driving test was not conducted properly. You will then be offered another driving test, free of charge. If the judge directs another test to be carried out, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport must arrange to have it conducted by another tester.
