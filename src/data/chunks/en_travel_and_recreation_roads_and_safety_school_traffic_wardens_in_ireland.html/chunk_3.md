###  Junior traffic wardens scheme

In many places, junior traffic wardens (usually senior pupils of primary
schools) work in teams of 6 to provide a similar service as the school traffic
warden.

A signal requesting traffic to stop is given from both sides of the road.
After traffic stops, the 6 junior traffic wardens take their position and
guide younger children across the public road. All vehicles must remain
stopped until all the junior traffic wardens have returned to the footpath.

To ensure the junior traffic wardens can carry out their function correctly,
they must have a clear view of the road. Drivers should never stop or park in
positions where they could obstruct the view of junior traffic wardens or
school traffic wardens.
