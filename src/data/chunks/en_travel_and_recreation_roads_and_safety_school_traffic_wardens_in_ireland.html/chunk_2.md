##  Introduction

Each local authority can arrange with An Garda Sióchána for school traffic
wardens to patrol places where school children cross public roads. The school
traffic warden’s role is to ensure that primary school children cross public
roads safely to and from school.

The law governing the appointment of school traffic wardens is the [ Road
Traffic Act, 1961 (Section 96), (as amended)
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1961/act/24/section/96/enacted/en/html#sec96)
. School traffic wardens usually work in the mornings, at lunchtime and in the
evenings, when children are most likely to cross the road to or from school.

School traffic wardens wear a distinctive uniform (a high-visibility coat and
hat). They must also carry a distinctive sign (a white disc with a red border
and the word ‘Stop’ in the centre).

By displaying this sign, the school traffic warden can stop the traffic to
enable schoolchildren to cross the road safely. Traffic must remain stopped if
the warden displays the sign.
