###  When will I get my Certificate of Freedom to Marry?

In most cases, the Department will send your Certificate of Freedom to Marry
directly to you. You should get it within 8 weeks of the date of the marriage.

**Note:** If you are getting married in Italy, the Department will send the
Certificate of Freedom to Marry to the Irish embassy in Rome. The embassy will
translate it and forward it to the address in Italy that you have specified in
your questionnaire.
