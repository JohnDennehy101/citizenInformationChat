###  Your foreign marriage certificate

If you need to show evidence that you are married, your foreign marriage
certificate will usually be accepted for official purposes in Ireland.

If your marriage takes place in an EU country, and your foreign marriage
certificate is not in English, you can ask for a multilingual standard form
(MSF), available in all EU languages, from the authorities of the EU country
which issued the public document.

If your marriage takes place in a non-EU country and the certificate is in a
foreign language, you must provide an official translation or a translation
from a recognised translation agency.

If you want a copy of your foreign marriage certificate, contact the civil
registration authority in the country where you were married.
