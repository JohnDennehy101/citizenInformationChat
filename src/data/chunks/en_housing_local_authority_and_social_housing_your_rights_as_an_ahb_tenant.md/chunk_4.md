##  Who do I contact if I have an issue?

Contact your AHB if you have a question or issue with your tenancy. There is
information on our website about what to do about [ anti-social behaviour
](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/anti-social-behaviour-and-
rent-arrears-in-social-housing/) and what to do [ if your relationship with
your joint tenant ends ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/joint-
tenancy-relationship-breakdown/) .

You can contact the [ Residential Tenancies Board
](https://www.rtb.ie/contact-us) , if you have an issue with your AHB tenancy.
The RTB has a dispute resolution service to help tenants and landlords resolve
their issues. You can also contact [ Threshold ](https://threshold.ie/) , the
national housing charity, for information and advice.
