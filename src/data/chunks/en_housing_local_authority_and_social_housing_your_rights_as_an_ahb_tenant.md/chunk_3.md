##  How are my rights different to a tenant in private rented housing?

If you are a tenant of an AHB, you have most of the same rights and
responsibilities as a tenant in private rented housing, with some exceptions,
which are:

  * The [ minimum standards ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/minimum-standards-for-rented-homes/) for food preparation, storage and laundry purposes do not apply to AHBs. This means that AHBs do not have to provide you with white goods, such as washing machines. 
  * [ Rent reviews ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/rent-increases-in-private-rented-housing/) should be carried out in accordance with your tenancy agreement (if there is one) or else no more than once a year. There is no specific notice period for a rent review, but you must be given notice as soon as is practicable. 
  * You may not assign or sublet your AHB tenancy 
  * Most AHB tenants will get [ security of tenure ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/types-of-tenancy/) after 6 months. Though, this does not apply if you are living in transitional accommodation and the tenancy is for 18 months or less. 
  * Your AHB can validly [ end your tenancy ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/) as long as they meet all the legal requirements. But, they cannot terminate a Part 4 tenancy because they need the property for their own or a family member's use.
