##  What are my rights if I am renting from an approved housing body?

If you are a tenant of an [ approved housing body ](/en/housing/local-
authority-and-social-housing/approved-housing-bodies/) or other voluntary
housing organisation, your tenancy is covered by residential tenancies
legislation. This means that you have most of the same rights and
responsibilities as a tenant in private rented housing. For example:

  * Your landlord (the AHB) must [ register your tenancy ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) every year with the [ Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-disputes/residential-tenancies-board/)
  * If you have problems with your tenancy, you or your landlord (or a neighbour affected by the problems) can use the RTBâ€™s [ dispute resolution service ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-disputes/disputes-between-landlords-and-tenants/)

Approved housing bodies came under the scope of residential tenancies
legislation on 7 April 2016, when the [ Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act
2015 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/42/enacted/en/html) came
into effect.
