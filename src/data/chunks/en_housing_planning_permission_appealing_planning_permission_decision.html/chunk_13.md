##  How does An Bord Plean√°la decide an appeal?

An inspector will assess your appeal and the documents you submitted. They
will normally visit the site in question and take photographs for their
report. The inspector will then write their report and recommendations for the
Board. Once this is submitted, the Board will make a decision.
