###  What if my appeal is invalid?

If your appeal is invalid, An Bord Plean√°la will post it back to you and
refund you. If you want, you can re-submit your appeal once you have amended
it.

You cannot give the Board additional information after you have made your
appeal, unless the Board requests this.
