##  Who can appeal or make an observation on a planning permission decision?

**You can appeal a decision to An Bord Pleanála if you:**

  * Are the person who applied to the planning authority for planning permission. This is called a first-party appeal.

**Other organisations or people who can appeal a decision**

Some organisations and people can appeal someone else’s planning decision,
even if they have not made submissions or observations at the planning
authority stage. They can only do this in certain circumstances. These
include:

  * Organisations that promote environmental protection, if an Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) was not submitted with a planning application when it had to have one 
  * Anyone who has an interest in the land which borders the site where planning permission has been granted. In this situation you apply to the Board for [ leave to appeal ](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-ie/leave-to-appeal) the decision.
