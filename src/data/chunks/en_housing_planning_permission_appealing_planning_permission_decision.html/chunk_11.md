###  Can my appeal be dismissed?

An Bord Pleanála can dismiss an appeal in certain circumstances. For example,
if they believe the appeal was:

  * Only meant to annoy or disturb 
  * Not serious 
  * Without any real substance 
  * Made to delay the development 
  * Made for a profit (such as money or gifts) 
  * Made by someone who can’t be identified
