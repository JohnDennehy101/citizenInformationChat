If your local authority (planning authority) accepts your application for [
planning permission ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/planning-
permission/planning-permission/) , it will review your application and any
submissions or observations on it and make a decision.

can appeal the decision to An Bord Pleanála.

This is called a planning appeal and it must be made within 4 weeks of the
date of the local authority’s decision.
