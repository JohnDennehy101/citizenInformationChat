##  What happens to my planning appeal next?

An Bord Plean치la aims to make a decision within 18 weeks. However, if this is
not possible, they will write to everyone involved to update them.

**In general, An Bord Plean치la will either:**

  * Grant planning permission 
  * Grant planning permission with conditions, or amended conditions, or 
  * Refuse planning permission 

Once a decision is reached in a planning appeal, An Bord Plean치la will send
you a letter with the decision.

The Board will not discuss the pros and cons of the decision. All decisions
are final and can only be challenged by judicial review in the High Court on a
point of law.

In these situations, the High Court will judge if the Board followed due
process in reaching its decision, but will not look at the planning merits of
an appeal.

Anyone can inspect the case file after the appeal has been decided. Case
details can be read online at [ pleanala.ie ](https://www.pleanala.ie/en-
ie/viewing-a-decided-case-file-public-access) , including the:

  * Inspector's report 
  * Board direction 
  * Board order 

The full case file can be viewed at the Board's offices for 5 years after the
appeal decision. An Bord Plean치la has more information on this in its page
Viewing a decided case file: Public Access.
