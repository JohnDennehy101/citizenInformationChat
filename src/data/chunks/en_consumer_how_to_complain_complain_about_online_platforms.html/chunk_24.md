###  **How the platform must handle your complaint**

The platform must:

  * Handle your complaint diligently and in a timely, non-discriminatory, and non-arbitrary way (this means they must follow principles and the correct process) 
  * Notify you of their decision about your complaint and their reasons without delay 
  * Advise you of the options for redress if you are not satisfied 

If the platform does not have a proper complaint process or you can't find a
suitable contact, you can bring your complaint to Coimisiún na Meán. See more
below.
