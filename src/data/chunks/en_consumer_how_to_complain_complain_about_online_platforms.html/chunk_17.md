##  Your content or account was wrongfully restricted, blocked or suspended

An online platform can restrict the visibility of a user’s content if the
content is illegal or does not comply with the provider’s terms and
conditions. Restricting the visibility means they can:

  * Remove it 
  * Disable access to it 
  * Demote it (meaning it does not appear high up when searched or as a recommended video)
