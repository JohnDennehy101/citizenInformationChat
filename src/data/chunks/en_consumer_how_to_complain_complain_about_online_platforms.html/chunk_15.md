###  **Recommender systems**

Platforms can often use recommender systems to decide which content to show
users and in which order.

Recommender systems can be abused and manipulated to fuel dangerous
disinformation and propagate illegal content.

An online platform that uses recommender systems must explain how content is
being selected to be shown or recommended to you in its terms and conditions.

The explanation must include:

  * How content is selected 
  * Options for you to change or influence recommendations
