###  **Ads shown to children and young people**

Online platforms that children can access must have appropriate and
proportionate measures to protect the privacy, safety, and security of
children using their services.

Services must not use profiling data to decide which ads to show children.
Profiling data is information about your preferences and interests from the
websites you visit, what you “like” or links you follow.
