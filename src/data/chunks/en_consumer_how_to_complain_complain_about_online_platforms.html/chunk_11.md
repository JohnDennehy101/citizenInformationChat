###  **What to expect after you report**

After reporting illegal content to the platform, you will receive confirmation
of your report from the platform, if you included your email.

If the platform identifies illegal content, they must act promptly to remove
or disable access.

You will be notified of their decision without delay. If the platform based
its decision using automation (without human input), they have to tell you how
they used automation. The platform must also give you information on how to
appeal their decision.
