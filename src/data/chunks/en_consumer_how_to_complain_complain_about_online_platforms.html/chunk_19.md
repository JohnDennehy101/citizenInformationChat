###  **Use of restrictions**

Online platforms must act diligently and objectively to apply these
restrictions. They must consider the rights and legitimate interests of all
parties involved. This includes the fundamental rights to:

  * Freedom of expression 
  * Freedom and pluralism of the media 

They must also consider other fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the
[ Charter of Fundamental Rights ](https://commission.europa.eu/aid-
development-cooperation-fundamental-rights/your-rights-eu/eu-charter-
fundamental-rights_en) .

If you believe an online platform has not met its obligations about its terms
and conditions, you can make a complaint to Coimisiún na Meán.
