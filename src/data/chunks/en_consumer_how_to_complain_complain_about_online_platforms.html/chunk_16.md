###  **Platform design concerns**

Platforms must not influence, deceive or manipulate users through their design
and online interface.

The platform must not:

  * Use deceptive design practices, for example, have pre-selected options 
  * Limit your freedom in choices 
  * Present you with false urgency messages or countdown timers 
  * Make it harder for you to cancel a subscription than to subscribe
