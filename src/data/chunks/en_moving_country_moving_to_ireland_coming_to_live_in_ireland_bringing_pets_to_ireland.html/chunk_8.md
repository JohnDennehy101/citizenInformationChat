###  Step 4 â€“ Tapeworm treatment

If you are bringing a dog into Ireland, it must be treated for tapeworm
(Echinococcus multilocularis) each time you travel to Ireland, unless you are
travelling from Northern Ireland, Finland, Malta or Norway. The treatment must
be given by a vet between 1 and 5 days before you arrive in Ireland, and
recorded in the pet passport.
