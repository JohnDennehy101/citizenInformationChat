##  Non-compliant pets

If your pet does not meet the entry requirements, it may be refused entry into
Ireland. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine may return your
pet to the country you travelled from.

Alternatively DAFM may place your pet into quarantine to be tested or
microchipped and vaccinated to comply with EU requirements. Your pet will
remain in quarantine until it fully complies with EU Legislation. In very
limited circumstances, your pet may be euthanised. You will have to pay to
cover the cost of these measures, including quarantine if necessary.
