###  Step 1 â€“ Microchipping

Your cat, dog or ferret must be microchipped before it is vaccinated against
rabies. The microchip must be readable by a device compatible with ISO
standard 11785\. If you or your vet is unsure about the specifications of the
microchip, you should contact the microchip manufacturer. Alternatively, you
can carry your own microchip reader with you which can be used on your pet.
