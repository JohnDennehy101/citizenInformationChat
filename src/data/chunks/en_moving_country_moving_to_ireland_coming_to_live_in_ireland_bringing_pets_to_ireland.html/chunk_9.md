##  Cats, dogs and ferrets â€“ Non EU travel

**Note** : If you travel from Britain (not including Northern Ireland) with
your pet after 1 January 2021, non EU rules apply. You must follow the
following process even if your pet is returning to Ireland from Britain and
was born and raised in Ireland. The rules for travelling from Northern Ireland
have not changed.

If your pet does not have an EU pet passport (GB pet passports are no longer
allowed, but NI pet passports are), you must have a health certificate issued
by UK authorities. You can read more about [ travelling from Britain
