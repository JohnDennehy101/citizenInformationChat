##  Introduction

The importation of pets into Ireland is strictly controlled to ensure that
diseases such as rabies are not introduced. The EU system of Passports for
Pets allows cats, dogs and ferrets to travel between EU member states and some
other countries that are part of the scheme.

The information in this document is about bringing a pet to Ireland, and is
not about buying a pet abroad, or bringing animals into Ireland for [
commercial purposes ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ffadc-commercial-dog-
cat-or-ferret-movements/) .

For EU rules to apply, you must travel to Ireland with your pet.

If you are bringing a cat, dog or ferret from outside the EU (including the UK
but not including Northern Ireland), you should follow the rules set out in
‘Cats, dogs and ferrets – non EU travel’ below.
