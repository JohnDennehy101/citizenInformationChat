##  Young people in abusive relationships

Many young people, in particular young women, are subjected to abuse in their
intimate relationships. This is called ‘intimate relationship abuse’. This is
when your boyfriend, girlfriend or partner uses a pattern of abusive
behaviours to gain and maintain all the power in the relationship.

Abuse can happen in short-term relationships or even your first relationship.
You don’t need to be living with your boyfriend, girlfriend, or partner for
them to be abusive towards you.

If you are worried about your relationship, you can take a relationship quiz
on the website [ Too Into You ](https://www.toointoyou.ie/take-the-quiz/) to
see if there are warning signs that your partner’s behaviour is controlling.

Examples of controlling or abusive behaviour can include:

  * Controlling what you wear and who you see 
  * Sharing or threatening to share intimate images or videos of you without your consent 
  * Isolating you from family and friends to make you feel guilty if you don’t spend all your free time with them 
  * Bombarding you with texts and DMs and getting angry if you ignore them 
  * Demanding to look through your phone or social media 
  * Checking your text messages, email and social media accounts to keep tabs on you 
  * A bad temper, you feel afraid to disagree with them 
  * Physically attacking you or threatening to hurt you 
  * Threatening to hurt you, themselves or others if you end the relationship 
  * Forcing you to do sexual things against your will 

Any one of these signs is serious. Your partner does not need to do several or
all of these things for your relationship to be abusive. If it feels wrong, it
probably is. Talking with someone can help you understand what is happening
within your relationship and support you to stay safe. This might be family or
a close friend.

Or you might feel more comfortable discussing your situation with someone you
don’t know. There is free confidential support and information available
24-hours a day from national and local organisations (see Support
organisations and services below).

Young people who are worried about their own relationship or a friend’s
relationship can use the free and confidential Instant Messaging Support
Service at [ Too Into You ](https://www.toointoyou.ie/) .
