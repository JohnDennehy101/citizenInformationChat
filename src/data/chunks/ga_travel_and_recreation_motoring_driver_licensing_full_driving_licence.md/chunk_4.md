###  **What is normal residence?**

To apply for a driving licence, you must be normally resident in Ireland. You
are normally resident if you usually live here for at least 185 days in each
calendar year.

Asylum seekers can use their temporary residence certificates as proof of
normal residence in Ireland when applying for a driving licence or learner
permit.
