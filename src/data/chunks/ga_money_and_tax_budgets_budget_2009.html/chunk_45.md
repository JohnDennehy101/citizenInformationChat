###  Motor tax

The Budget provides for increases in motor tax rates and fees for trade
licence plates.

The proposed increases are 4% for cars below 2.5 litres capacity and in CO2
emissions bands A to D, and 5% for cars above the 2.5 litre threshold and in
CO2 emissions bands E, F and G.

Goods vehicles and all other vehicles will also increase by 4%.

There is no increase for electric vehicles.

Trade plate licences will also increase by 4%.

The new rates will apply to motor tax discs and trade plate licences taken out
for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
