###  Affordable housing

Introduction of a Government Equity Initiative to assist those seeking
affordable housing. Under this Initiative the Government will assist those
seeking affordable housing by taking an equity share. It will replace the
current approach through which affordable housing is made available under Part
V, the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme and the Affordable Housing Initiative.

Instead of selling units at a discounted price with the value of the discount
to be subject to a reducing claw-back, the Government would take an equity
stake in affordable units sold, which the purchaser can either buy out in
steps or at the end of a fixed period.
