###  Charge on non-principal private residences

A charge will be introduced on all non-principal private residences. The
charge will be levied and collected by local authorities, and will be used to
support the provision of local services.

The new charge will be set at â‚¬200 per dwelling, and will come into effect in
2009. It will be payable by the owners of private rented accommodation,
holiday homes and other non-principal residences but will not be applied to
new dwellings as yet unsold. Legislation will be needed to give effect to
these arrangements.
