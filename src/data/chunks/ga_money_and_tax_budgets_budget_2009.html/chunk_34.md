###  Medical cards for over 70s

**New applications**

From 1 January 2009 new income thresholds will apply for medical cards for
people aged 70 and over. (The existing arrangements continue to apply until
the end of 2008.)

New income thresholds will be €700 weekly gross for a single person (36,500
per year) and €1,400 a week (€73,000 a year) for a couple. It appears at
present that there will be no deductions allowed as were outlined in previous
announcements, for example, rent or mortgage or medical expenses.

If one member of a couple is aged 70, they will both qualify for a medical
card if their income is below €1,400 a week.

Income from savings will be taken into account, but savings up to the first
€36,000 (for a single person) and €72,000 (for a couple) are not counted.

**People over age 70 who already have a medical card**

The card will not expire on 31st December 2008, as stated in previous
announcements.

The HSE will write to all people aged 70 and over informing them about the new
arrangements. **Only people who have income above the limits** will be asked
to reply to the HSE. Everyone else will simply keep their card.

People over these limits can still apply for medical cards on a hardship basis
under the discretionary scheme.
