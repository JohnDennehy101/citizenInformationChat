####  **Computer games**

Ireland uses the [ Pan-European Game Information (PEGI)
](https://pegi.info/what-do-the-labels-mean) age rating system for the
classification of computer games. It is a voluntary system that retailers
selling computer games are expected to follow. The classifications are as
follows:

  * 3+: The game content is suitable for all age groups 
  * 7+: The game content is suitable for children aged 7 or over 
  * 12+: The game content is suitable for children aged 12 or over 
  * 16+: The game content is suitable for children aged 16 or over 
  * 18+: The game content is suitable for people aged 18 or over 

The age rating does not take into account the difficulty level or skills
required to play a game.
