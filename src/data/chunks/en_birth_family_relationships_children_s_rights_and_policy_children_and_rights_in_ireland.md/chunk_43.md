###  Criminal responsibility

The age of criminal responsibility is 12 years of age. This means that
children who have not reached the age of 12 cannot be charged with an offence.
There is an exception, however, for children aged 10 or 11, who can be charged
with murder, manslaughter, rape or aggravated sexual assault.

Where a child under 14 years of age is charged with an offence, no further
proceedings can be taken without the consent of the [ Director of Public
Prosecutions ](http://www.dppireland.ie/) .

**Children under 12  
** Where the Gardaí have reasonable grounds for believing that a child under
12 years of age has committed an offence with which the child cannot be
charged due to his/her age, the Gardaí must take the child to his/her parents
or guardian. Where this is not possible, the Gardaí will arrange for the child
to be taken into the custody of the [ Child and Family Agency (Tusla)
](http://www.tusla.ie/) services for the area in which the child normally
resides. It is possible that children under 12 years of age who commit
criminal offences will be dealt with by Tusla and not the criminal justice
system. Information on the powers available to Tusla is available in our
document, [ Children in care ](/en/birth-family-relationships/services-and-
supports-for-children/children-in-care/) .
