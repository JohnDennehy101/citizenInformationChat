###  School attendance

Attendance at school (or receiving an education) is compulsory from the age of
6 up to age 16 or until students have completed 3 years of second-level
education, whichever is the later.

There is no compulsory [ early childhood education ](/en/education/pre-school-
education-and-childcare/early-childhood-education/) .

[ Tusla - the Child and Family Agency ](http://www.tusla.ie/) is the national
agency established to ensure that every child attends school regularly, or
otherwise receives an appropriate minimum education. The Board:

  * Monitors school attendance, and takes a range of measures where children do not attend school 
  * Maintains a register of children who are not attending a recognised school 
  * Maintains a register of children aged 16 and 17 who leave school early to take up employment and makes arrangements for their continuing education and training in consultation with providers and employers 

Parents and guardians have a legal obligation to ensure that their child
attends a school or otherwise receives an education. If Tusla considers that
the parents are failing in their obligation, it sends the parents a School
Attendance Notice warning and if the parents fail to comply, they may be
prosecuted. Further information is available in our document on [ school
attendance ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/attendance-and-
discipline-in-schools/school-attendance/) .

The Board also intervenes in relation to proposed school expulsions.

education system ](/en/education/the-irish-education-system/overview-of-the-
