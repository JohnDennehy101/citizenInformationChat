###  Elections

In order to vote in an [ election or referendum ](/en/government-in-
ireland/elections-and-referenda/) in Ireland, you must be [ registered to vote
](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/registering-to-
vote/) . To be eligible to be included on the Register of Electors, you must
be at least 18 years old and ordinarily resident in Ireland at the time of
making the application.

If you are 16 or 17 years old, you can apply to be included in the 'pending
elector list' but you are not entitled to vote until you reach 18, at which
point you will automatically be added to the Register of Electors. In the
event that an election is called, if you are included in the pending elector
list you will be included in the Register of Electors in force for that
election even if you turn 18 on polling day.

The pending elector list is not part of the register, and it is not available
for inspection.

You cannot stand as a candidate in an election until you are at least 18 years
of age. You must be:

  * Age 18 for local elections 
  * Age 21 for national and European elections 
  * Age 35 for presidential elections
