###  Children Court

Children being charged with a crime are dealt with by the [ Children Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/children-court/) . The court can impose a period
of detention on a child. Children between the ages of 10 and 17 sentenced by
the courts to a period of detention are sent to the [ Oberstown Children
Detention Campus ](https://www.oberstown.com/) . The court can only impose a
detention order where it is satisfied that it is the only suitable way to deal
with the child and a place in a children detention school is available.
Oberstown is funded by the [ Irish Youth Justice Service
](http://www.iyjs.ie/en/IYJS/Pages/Home) . People aged 18 years or over may be
sent to prison.

Apart from detention there are also diversion programmes and community
sanctions available to the court.

There is more information on children and the criminal justice system in our
section on [ children and young offenders ](/en/justice/children-and-young-
offenders/) .
