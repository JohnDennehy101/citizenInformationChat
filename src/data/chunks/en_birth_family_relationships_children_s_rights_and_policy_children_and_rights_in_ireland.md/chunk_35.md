###  Contraceptive services

There is no set minimum age in Ireland at which [ contraceptive advice and
prescriptions ](/en/health/health-services/reproductive_health/contraception/)
may be provided. The age of consent to sexual activity is 17 and it may be a
criminal offence to have sex with a person under 17 years of age. This means
that providers of contraceptive services are entitled to refuse to provide
those services to people under 17.
