###  Sexual activity

Under [ Section 3 of the Criminal Law (Sex Offences) Act 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/15/section/3/enacted/en/html#sec3)
as amended by [ Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment)
Act 2007
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2007/act/6/section/5/enacted/en/html#sec5)
it is a criminal offence to engage or attempt to engage in a sexual act with a
child under 17 years of age. It is not a defence to show that the child
consented to the sexual act. However, the [ Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act
2017 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/act/2/enacted/en/html)
recognises the reality of under age, consensual, peer relationships through
the introduction of a ‘proximity of age’ defence. Under this provision, a
person charged with an offence of engaging in a sexual act with a person
between the ages of 15 and 17 years can use consent as a defence if the person
charged is younger or is less than two years older. They must not be in
authority over the child or be intimidatory or exploitative.

The consent of the [ Director of Public Prosecutions
](http://www.dppireland.ie/) is required for any prosecution of a child under
the age of 17 years for this offence. A girl under the age of 17 who has
sexual intercourse may not be convicted of an offence on that ground alone.

It is an offence for a person in authority to engage or attempt to engage in a
sexual act with a child under 18 years of age.
