###  Working

The law sets out different rules for young workers, depending on your age.
Workers aged 14 and 15 are classed as ‘children’. Workers aged 16 and 17 are
classed as ‘young persons’.

Under the [ Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0016/index.html) employers
cannot employ children under age 16 in regular full-time jobs. Children under
age 14 cannot be employed. Children aged 14 and 15 may be employed as follows:

  * Doing light work during the school holidays – they must have at least 21 days off work during this time 
  * As part of an approved work experience or educational programme where the work is not harmful to their health, safety or development 
  * In film, cultural, advertising work or sport under licences issued by the government. 

Children aged 15 may do 8 hours a week light work in school term time. The
maximum working week for children outside school term time is 35 hours or up
to 40 hours if they are on approved work experience.

The maximum working week for children aged 16 and 17 is 40 hours with a
maximum of 8 hours a day.
