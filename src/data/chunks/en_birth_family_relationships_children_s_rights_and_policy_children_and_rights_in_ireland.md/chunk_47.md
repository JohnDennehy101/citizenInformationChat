###  Contracts

You cannot enter a legally binding contract until you are aged 18. The
exception to this is _contracts for necessaries_ and _beneficial contracts of
service_ which are in your best interests. _Contracts for necessaries_ usually
include contracts for food, clothing and lodging, but may also cover contracts
for items connected with education and training such as school books and
training uniforms.

Beneficial contracts of service usually involve contracts for apprenticeships
or contracts with agents or managers. These contracts of service are only
enforceable if they are to your advantage and in your best interests.
