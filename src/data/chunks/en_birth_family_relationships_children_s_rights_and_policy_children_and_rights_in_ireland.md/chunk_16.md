###  Alcohol

Under the [ Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/act/31/section/13/enacted/en/index.html)
, it is an offence to buy alcohol or for someone to buy it for you, if you are
under age 18. It is also an offence for you to drink alcohol unless you are in
a private residence and have your parents’ consent.

It is an offence for you to be in an off-licence unless you are with a parent
or guardian.

Children are only allowed on licensed premises if they are with a parent or
guardian, but this provision carries certain restrictions. If accompanied by a
parent/guardian, a child may remain on the premises up to 9pm (10pm from May
to September) unless the licence holder feels this is harmful to the child's
health, safety and welfare. Children aged between 15-17 years may remain on
the premises after 9pm where they are attending a private function at which a
substantial meal is served.

Under the [ Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2008/en/act/pub/0017/sec0014.html) the Gardaí
have the power to seize alcohol in the possession of a child under 18 years of
age where the Gardaí have reasonable cause to believe that the alcohol will be
consumed by a child under 18 years in a public place.
