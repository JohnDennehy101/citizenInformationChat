###  Firearms

You have to be aged 16 or over before you can apply for a firearms
certificate. You have to be aged 14 or over before you can apply for a
firearms training certificate. A firearms training certificate does not allow
you to own a firearm but it does allow you to possess a firearm while carrying
and using it under the supervision of the person who holds a firearm
certificate for that firearm and is over 18 years of age.

The requirement to have a firearm certificate also applies to crossbows,
spearguns and all airguns above a certain muzzle velocity (including paintball
markers).
