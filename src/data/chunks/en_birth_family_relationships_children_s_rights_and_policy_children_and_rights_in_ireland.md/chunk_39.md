###  Maintenance

A parent is required to maintain a dependent child. A dependent child is a
child who:

  * Is under 18 years old or 
  * Is over 18 and under 23 years old but is still in full-time education 

If a court decides that the parent of a dependent child has failed to provide
maintenance for the child as is _proper in the circumstances_ , it may order
that parent to make periodical maintenance payments to support the child. The
court may also order a parent to pay a lump sum.

Further information is available in our documents, [ Maintenance orders and
agreements ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) and [ Maintenance and unmarried
couples ](/en/birth-family-relationships/parenting-alone/maintenance-lone-
parents/) .
