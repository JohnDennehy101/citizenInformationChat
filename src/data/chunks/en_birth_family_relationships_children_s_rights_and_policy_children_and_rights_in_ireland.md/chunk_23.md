###  Pet ownership

Under the [ Control of Dogs Act 1986
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1986/en/act/pub/0032/index.html) you cannot
keep a dog unless you have a [ dog licence ](/en/environment/pets-and-
wildlife/control-of-dogs/) for it and the dog is microchipped. A local
authority does not issue a dog licence to anyone under 16 years of age.

If you have your dog out in public you must keep it under control, such as on
a lead. Certain breeds of dog must be muzzled at all times in public. These
dogs must be led by someone over the age of 16 and kept on a strong chain or
lead that is no longer than 2 metres.

You do not require a licence to own other pets and there is no legislation
specifying a minimum age at which you can own a pet.
