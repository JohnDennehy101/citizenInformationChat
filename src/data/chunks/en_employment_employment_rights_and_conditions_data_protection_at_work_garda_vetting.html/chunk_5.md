##  Garda vetting for hosting Ukrainian refugees

Special procedures have been set up by the Department of Children, Equality,
Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY), the Garda National Vetting Bureau
(GNVB) and the Irish Red Cross for vetting host families accommodating
Ukrainian refugees.

Garda vetting applies to host families, including hosts and family members
over 16 who are sharing their homes with Ukrainian families, especially those
with children or vulnerable people.
