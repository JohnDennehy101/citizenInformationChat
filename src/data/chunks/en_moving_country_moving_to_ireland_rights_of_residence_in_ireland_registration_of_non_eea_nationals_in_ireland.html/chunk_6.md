###  ‘D’ or long stay visa holders

If you have recently come to Ireland on a ‘D’ (long stay) visa, or you are a
citizen of a country that does not require an entry visa (non-visa required),
you can register with ISD without making a written application in advance.
This could be because you are:

  * Joining a family member who has international protection in Ireland (family reunification) 
  * Joining or moving to Ireland with your Irish spouse or family member 
  * Joining or moving to Ireland with your dependant Irish family member 
  * An international student 
  * On a working holiday visa 
  * Moving to Ireland with an employment permit
