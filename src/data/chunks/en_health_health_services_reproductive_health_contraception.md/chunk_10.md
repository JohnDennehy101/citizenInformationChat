##  Does the medical card cover contraception?

Yes. If you have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) , you get free contraceptive drugs, devices and free GP
services including contraceptive advice. You can also get [ emergency
contraception ](https://sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-
health/contraception/emergency-contraception/) with the medical card.

You will have to pay a [ prescription charge ](/en/health/drugs-and-
medicines/prescription-charges-for-medical-card-holders/) for items you get
from pharmacies under the medical card scheme.

**If you do not have a medical card,** and you are not eligible for the free
contraception scheme (above), you will have to pay for contraception and
contraceptive services. You may be able to reduce the cost of your
contraception through the [ Drug Payment Scheme ](/en/health/drugs-and-
medicines/drugs-payment-scheme/) . For example, the cost of long-acting
reversible contraceptives such as the IUS (hormonal coil) or IUD (copper
coil). You may also be able to claim [ tax relief on medical expenses
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/taxation-and-medical-
expenses/) .
