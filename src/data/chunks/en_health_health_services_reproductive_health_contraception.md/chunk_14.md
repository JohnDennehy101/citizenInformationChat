##  Emergency contraception

[ Emergency contraception ](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-
health/contraception/emergency-contraception/emergency-contraception/) is a
back-up contraception. You can use emergency contraception to stop an
unplanned pregnancy after you have had sex without using contraception, or if
your method of contraception has failed (for example, the condom slipped, or
you missed a pill).

You can choose [ different types of emergency contraception options
](https://www.sexualwellbeing.ie/sexual-health/contraception/emergency-
contraception/your-emergency-contraception-choices/) depending on your
situation:

  * The emergency contraceptive pill (sometimes called the morning-after pill) which delays ovulation 
  * The copper coil (also known as post-coital IUD) which prevents sperm from joining an egg and can stop a fertilised egg from attaching to the uterus. 

The copper coil works even after ovulation has happened, unlike the emergency
contraception pill. The copper coil is the only form of contraception that
will be effective after you have already ovulated.
