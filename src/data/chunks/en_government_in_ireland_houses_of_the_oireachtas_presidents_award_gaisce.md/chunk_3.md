##  How can I get a Gaisce award?

To achieve a Gaisce award, you set a demanding challenge for yourself in 4
different areas of activity:

  * Community involvement - for example, helping older people or learning first aid or lifesaving skills 
  * Personal skill - for example, learning a musical instrument, computer skills or driving 
  * Physical recreation - for example, swimming, football or tennis 
  * Adventure journey - for example, a cycling, canoeing or hiking group trip 

To achieve the top level of award (Gold) you must also take part in a
residential project, such as a residential Irish-language course, a
residential sports course or a work placement in a care home.

When you have completed your personal challenges, you will earn your award.
