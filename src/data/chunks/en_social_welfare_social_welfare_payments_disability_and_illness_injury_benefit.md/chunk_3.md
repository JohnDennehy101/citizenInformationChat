##  Statutory Sick Pay and Injury Benefit

From 1 Jan 2024, [ Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/sick-leave-and-sick-pay/) increased
from 3 to 5 days a year. You cannot get Injury Benefit on the days that you
get SSP.

If you are unfit for work for 3 days or less, you can still register an Injury
Benefit claim to create a record of the occupational accident (see ‘Number of
days ill or incapacitated’ below).

If your injury or illness lasts more than 5 days, your Injury Benefit starts
from day 6.

If you use your 5 days of SSP in 2024 and you become ill again in the same
year, you'll get Injury Benefit from day 4 of your illness (after the normal 3
waiting days).

See [ examples of how SSP affects Injury Benefit

leave-in-2024/#examples) on gov.ie.
