##  Can I get Child Benefit?

The Department of Social Protection pays Child Benefit to the child’s mother
or stepmother. However, if you are the child’s father or stepfather, you can
get the payment if the child does not live with their mother or step-mother.

If you are caring for a child who is not living with their parents (or not
being maintained by their parents), you may get Child Benefit.

If your child lives between 2 separate households (for example, if the parents
are separated), the DSP pays Child Benefit to the parent who lives with the
child most of the time. If the child lives an equal amount of time with each
parent, the mother gets Child Benefit.
