##  Your employment rights

If you are an older worker, whether full or part-time, you are protected by
legislation. This is because most legislation dealing with employment rights
does not have an upper age limit. The law protects you in the following areas:

  * [ Information about your terms and conditions of employment ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/)
  * [ Holidays and leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-leave/)
  * [ National minimum wage ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/)
  * [ Maximum working hours ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/working-hours/) , [ rest periods ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/work-breaks-and-rest-periods/) , Sunday working, [ night working ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-work/night-work/)
  * [ Health and safety at work ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/health-and-safety/health-safety-work/)
  * [ Minimum notice ](/en/employment/starting-work-and-changing-job/changing-job/giving-notice/) \- the amount of notice is related to the length of service 

If you [ lose your job ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/losing-
your-job/losing-your-job/) and your employer owes you money for arrears of
pay, holidays and a number of other items, you may claim this from the Social
Insurance Fund.
