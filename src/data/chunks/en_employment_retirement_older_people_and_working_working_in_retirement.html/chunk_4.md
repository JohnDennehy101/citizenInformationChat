###  Returning to work in the public sector

If you were a permanent and pensionable public servant, your pension may be
_abated_ if you go back to work in the public sector.

In general, _abatement_ means your pension is reduced. This is to make sure
you do not earn more between the pension and the income from employment, than
you would otherwise earn if you had stayed in your original employment. The
exact conditions of abatement may differ from one pension scheme to another.

It is generally not possible to contribute more to your public sector
occupational pension scheme after the normal age of retirement.
