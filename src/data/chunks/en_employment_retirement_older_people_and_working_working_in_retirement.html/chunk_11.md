###  If you are under 70

From 1 January 2024, if you are aged under 70 and you are employed or self-
employed, you pay PRSI in the normal way. There are some exceptions â€“ see more
below.

This applies to all types of workers, regardless of what you did earlier. For
example, if you are a former public servant and you take up a job in the
private sector, you have to pay full PRSI. In these circumstances, you may be
able to qualify for a [ pro-rata State contributory pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) .

You only pay PRSI on your income from employment or self-employment. You do
not have to pay PRSI on your pension from a former employment.
