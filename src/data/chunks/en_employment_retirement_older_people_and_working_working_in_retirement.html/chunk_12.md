####  **Exceptions**

The changes above do not apply if you are either:

  * Already getting the State Pension (Contributory) 
  * Aged 66 or older, by 1 January 2024 (you were born before 1 January 1958) 

If you are 66 or older by 1 January 2024, you are not affected by the changes
in PRSI status. You do not pay PRSI on your income and your employer continues
to pay Class J at the 0.5% rate.
