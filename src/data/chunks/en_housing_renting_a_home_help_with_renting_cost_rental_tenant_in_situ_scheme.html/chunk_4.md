##  Do I qualify for the Cost Rental Tenant in Situ Scheme?

You can access the scheme if you are a private tenant who has received a valid
notice of termination because your landlord is selling and:

  * You are unable to buy the property from your landlord or do not want to 
  * You are at risk of homelessness 
  * You have a long-term right to live in Ireland 
  * You are not getting social housing support, such as the Housing Assistance Payment or Rental Accommodation Scheme 
  * You do not own other residential property 
  * Your net household income is below €66,000 per annum for Dublin and €59,000 for everywhere else in the country. These [ income limits were increased from €53,000 nationwide on 1 August 2023 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/18146-new-income-eligibility-limits-for-affordable-cost-rental-take-effect/) . (Net income is the amount you are left with once income tax, Universal Social Charge, Additional Superannuation Contribution (ASC) and PRSI are deducted from your income.)
