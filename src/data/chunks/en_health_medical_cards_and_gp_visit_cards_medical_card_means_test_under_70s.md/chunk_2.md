##  Introduction

If you are aged under 70 when you apply for a [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit
card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) , the HSE
will review your situation and your weekly income to check if you qualify.
This may include a review of your financial situation, called a means test.

Your income, savings, investments and property are assessed in the means test,
but there are certain exceptions. If you have a spouse or partner, the HSE
looks at your combined finances.

Check if you automatically qualify for a medical card, as some [ people are
exempt from the means test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/#552e17) . If you are not in one of these groups, your
income is reviewed by the HSE and must be below a certain amount to qualify.

This page explains the means test for people aged under 70 â€“ how it is carried
out, what income is included and what income is excluded.
