###  **Property that is not rented**

**If you are aged under 70** and have unused land or buildings that you are
not renting, but could be leased or sold, the HSE reviews the value of the
property as a savings and investment assessment (above).

**If you are** [ **aged over 70** ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card-means-test-over-70s/) **,** income will not be assessed
from any property that is not generating a rental income.
