##  How does the means test work?

The HSE has _basic rates_ that vary depending on your age, living situation,
marital status and if you have children. If your income is below the HSE basic
rate, you will qualify.

The basic rate income limits for the [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-
cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) are lower than the limits for the [ GP
visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) .

Your weekly income is your net income. This is your income after tax, PRSI and
Universal Social Charge (USC) have been deducted.

If your income is above the HSEâ€™s basic rate, you may still qualify for a [
medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or [
GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/)
after you add extra allowances for children and allowable expenses (see
below).

**Discretionary medical card**

If your finances are still above the qualifying limits for both a [ medical
card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) and [ GP
visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) the
HSE can look at your social and medical situation. They will decide if you
would have trouble paying for medical care for you and your family and may
provide a medical card. You can read more about [ discretionary medical cards.
