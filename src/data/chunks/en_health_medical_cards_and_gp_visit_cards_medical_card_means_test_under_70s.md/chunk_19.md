##  How is self-employment income assessed?

If you are self-employed and applying for a [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit
card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) , you will
need to provide evidence of all your work, both self-employed and for other
employers.

The HSE will review your most recent Income Tax Return Form 11 and all pages
of your Notice of Assessment (NOA) from Revenue.

If you are self-employed and your business has been **running for less than
one year,** you need to provide a set of accounts signed off by your
accountant.

If you are self-employed and your business has **recently stopped trading,**
you need to provide a self-declaration letter indicating the date you were
last self-employed.
