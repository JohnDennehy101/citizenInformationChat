###  **GP visit cards**

If you are under 70, the way the HSE assesses your financial means is the same
for the [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-
card/) and for the [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/gp-visit-cards/) – but the income limits are different.

If your income is above the limit for a medical card, you are automatically
assessed by the HSE for the [ GP visit card
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/gp-visit-cards/) which has higher income limits.

You automatically get a [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) without a means test if you are either:

  * [ Aged under 8 ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards-for-under-8s/) or [ over 70 ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card-means-test-over-70s/)
  * Get [ Carer’s Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-benefit/) or [ Carer’s Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-allowance/) at full or half-rate
