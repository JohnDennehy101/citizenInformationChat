###  Travel abroad

You should check the public health advice, document requirements and COVID-19
restrictions that are in place in the country you are going to. You should do
this even if you are [ travelling to an EEA country ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/travel-abroad/travelling-abroad-during-covid#l7fbe5) .

Ireland was operating the [ EU Digital COVID Certificate ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/travel-abroad/digital-covid-certificate/) for travel within the EU
and EEA. Since 1 July 2023, you will no longer get an EU Digital Covid
Certificate for a negative test (PCR and antigen) or as proof of recovery
(recovery certificates).
