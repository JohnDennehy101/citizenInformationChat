###  Legally enforceable maintenance payments

If you make legally enforceable maintenance payments, you can have the
payments deducted from the amount of your income that is taxed.

You can [ claim tax relief ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/maintenance-and-tax/#83a792) on
payments you make for the benefit of your former partner. Payments you make
for the benefit of your children do not get tax relief.

You must make the maintenance payments in full.

This does not apply if you and your former partner choose to be taxed as a
married couple. In this case the payments are ignored for income tax.
