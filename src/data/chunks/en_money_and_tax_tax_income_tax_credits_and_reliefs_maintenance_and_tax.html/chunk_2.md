##  Introduction

When a couple separate, they may agree that payments will be made to support a
child or former partner. It may be a legal agreement or a voluntary agreement
between the former partners.

The way maintenance payments are taxed depends on whether they are:

  * Voluntary or made under a legal agreement 
  * For the benefit of a former partner or for the benefit of a child 

A former partner is:

  * A separated or former spouse or civil partner 
  * A former cohabitant you lived with, while not married, for at least: 
    * 2 years if you have children together 
    * 5 years if you do not have children together 

This page explains the different  types of payments  and how they affect your
tax if you are:

  * Making maintenance payments 
  * Getting maintenance payments 

In summary, [ legally enforceable maintenance payments
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-
and-reliefs/maintenance-and-tax/#42c886) for a former partner are:

  * Taxable for the person getting the payments 
  * Tax deductible for the person making the payments 

Voluntary maintenance payments are not taken into account in the tax of either
former partner.

Maintenance payments for the benefit of your child or children are also
ignored for tax purposes.
