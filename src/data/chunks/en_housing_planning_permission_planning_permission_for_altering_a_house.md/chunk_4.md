###  Extensions smaller than 40 square metres

You can build an extension or conservatory to the rear of your house as long
as it:

  * Does not increase the original floor area of the house by more than 40 square metres 
  * Is not higher than the house 

An extension **above ground level** must be at least 2 metres away from any
boundary and the floor area must not exceed:

  * 12 square metres for terraced or semi-detached houses 
  * 20 square metres for detached houses 

Under these rules, the total floor area is:

  * The floor area of the extension you are now proposing, and 
  * The floor area of any previous extensions including those you previously got planning permission for 

Also, the extension must not reduce the open space at the back of the house
(that is used only by the people who live in the house) to less than 25 square
metres.

There are also detailed rules about:

  * The height of an extension 
  * Where the windows are placed in an extension 
  * How the roof is used
