###  Garages and sheds

You can convert a garage attached to the back or side of your house to
domestic use as long as it has a floor area of less than 40 square metres. If
you want to convert a garage for business use, see â€˜ [ Planning permission for
a material change of use
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/planning-permission/planning-
permission-for-altering-a-house/#037386) ' below.

You can build a garage, shed, greenhouse or similar structure at the back or
side of your house as long as it:

  * Does not extend out in front of the building line of the house 
  * Is 4 metres or lower in height if it has a tiled or slated pitched roof, or 3 metres in height if it has any other roof type 

You do not need planning permission for this type of garage or shed as long as
the floor area on its own or together with any similar structures isn't more
than 25 square metres.

The new garage or shed should not reduce the open space at the back or side of
the house to less than 25 square metres.

Garages or sheds to the side of the house must match the finish of the house.

There are certain rules you must follow when building a garage or shed. They
must not be:

  * Lived in 
  * Used for commercial purposes 
  * Used for keeping pigs, poultry, pigeons, ponies or horses
