##  Do I need planning permission to alter my house?

If you are going to build an extension or make other changes to your house,
you may need planning permission from your local authority.

The most common reasons for needing planning permission are when you want to:

  * Build an extension which is more than 40 square metres (this includes new and any existing extensions) 
  * Change how your land is used, like converting a garage to a place of business. This is known as a “material change of use”. 

Generally, you do not need planning permission for minor changes to your
house. See ‘ [ What changes can I make without planning permission
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/planning-permission/planning-
permission-for-altering-a-house/#94e413) ’ below.

However, you should check if you need planning permission before you start
building. If you do not get planning permission when it is needed, you may
have to pay a large fine or even face going to prison. Your local authority
can advise you if you have questions.

types of planning permission, see our page on [ Planning permission
