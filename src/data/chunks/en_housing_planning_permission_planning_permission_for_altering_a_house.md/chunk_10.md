###  Objects on the roof of the house

You can install:

  * A TV aerial on the roof so long as it is less than 6 metres above the roof 
  * A satellite dish at the back or side of the house up to one metre in diameter, and not higher than the top of the roof 

You must get full planning permission for a satellite dish on the front of the
house. You must only install one satellite dish on your house.
