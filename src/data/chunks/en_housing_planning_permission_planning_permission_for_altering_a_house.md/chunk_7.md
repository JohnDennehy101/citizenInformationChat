###  Capped walls, wooden fences, gates and access

You can build capped walls (made of brick, stone or block), railings and
wooden fences up to 1.2 metres in height at the front of the house, or 2
metres at the side or back of the house. This includes security fences.

You can build gates up to 2 metres high.

You always need planning permission if you want to widen or create new access
to a public road.
