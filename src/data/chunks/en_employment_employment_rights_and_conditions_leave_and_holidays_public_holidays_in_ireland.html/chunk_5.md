###  How is the date of Easter Monday set each year?

Easter Monday is the only public holiday that can vary significantly from year
to year. The date of Easter moves every year.

Easter should be the first Sunday after the first full moon occurring on or
after 21 March. This means the earliest possible date for Easter Sunday in any
year is 22 March, and the latest is 25 April.

**Easter Monday falls on 1 April 2024 and 21 April 2025.**
