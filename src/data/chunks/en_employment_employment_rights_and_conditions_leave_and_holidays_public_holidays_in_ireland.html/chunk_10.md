###  **You are a full-time worker**

If you are on [ sick leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/sick-leave-and-sick-pay/) during a public
holiday, you are entitled to benefit for the public holiday you missed. Your
employer can also choose to regard you as not on sick leave on the public
holiday and pay you as normal for the public holiday. If this is the case, the
public holiday is not counted as a sick leave day.
