###  Are blood tests covered?

Routine blood tests may be covered by your [ medical card
](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card/) or [ GP visit
card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) . You
should ask your GP if your blood tests are covered. You can also check with
your [ local primary care unit ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/primary-care-
centres/) if blood tests are covered for your condition.

You can make a complaint to [ your local HSE Health Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) if you believe that your GP may
have incorrectly charged you for a routine blood test:

  * To assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition, or 
  * Under the Chronic Disease Management programme 

They will contact the GP concerned and carry out an investigation into the
complaint and will refund you if you were charged incorrectly for the blood
test.
