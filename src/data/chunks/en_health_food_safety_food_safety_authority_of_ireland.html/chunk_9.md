###  Closure orders

If there is an immediate danger to public health, the authorised officer may
issue a **closure order** . This means the owner must close all or part of the
food premises until the issue has been resolved. A closure order may also be
issued if an improvement order is not acted on.

[ Closure and prohibition orders ](https://www.fsai.ie/about/what-we-
do/enforcement-compliance/enforcement-orders) are listed on the FSAI website.  

You can read about the [ orders and enforcement powers that the FSAI has

your local Environmental Health Officer
