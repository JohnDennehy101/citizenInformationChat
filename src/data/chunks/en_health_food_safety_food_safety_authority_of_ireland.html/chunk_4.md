###  Food safety assurance schemes

The FSAI may, either on its own or with food producers, set up schemes to
protect consumer interests â€“ for example, the [ Bord Bia Quality Assurance
schemes ](https://www.bordbia.ie/farmers-growers/get-involved/become-quality-
assured/) .

These food safety schemes cover:

  * The promotion of best practice guidelines 
  * The preparation of guidelines on raw materials, processing, packaging, preparation, storage and handling
