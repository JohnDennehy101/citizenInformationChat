###  Nursing home care

If your family member needs nursing home care, they need to choose a nursing
home that meets their needs. You can find a [ list of registered nursing homes
](https://www.hiqa.ie/areas-we-work/find-a-centre/map) on the HIQA website.
The HSE also has a [ guide to choosing a nursing home (pdf)
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/olderpeople/residentialcare/nursinghomechecklist.pdf)
.

If they need help paying for nursing home care, they can apply to the Nursing
Home Support Scheme, also known as the [ Fair deal scheme ](/en/health/health-
services/health-services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/) . Under Fair
Deal, they pay a certain amount towards the cost of their care and the HSE
pays the rest. Fair Deal covers approved [ private nursing homes, voluntary
nursing homes ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/fair-deal-scheme/choosing-a-nursing-
home/cost-of-voluntary-and-private-nursing-homes.pdf) and [ public nursing
homes ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/fair-deal-scheme/choosing-a-nursing-home/cost-
of-care-in-public-nursing-homes-2018.pdf) .

They must be ordinarily resident in Ireland to qualify for the Fair Deal
scheme. If the person who needs nursing home care has not yet returned to
Ireland, [ contact Safe Home Ireland ](https://safehomeireland.com/contact-
us-2/) for information on applying for the Fair Deal scheme.

If they choose to pay for nursing home care privately, they must pay the full
cost of the private nursing home directly.
