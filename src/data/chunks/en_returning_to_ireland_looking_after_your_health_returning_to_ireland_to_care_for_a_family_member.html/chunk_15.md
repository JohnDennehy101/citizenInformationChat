###  Other supports

You may qualify for an annual [ Carer's Support Grant ](/en/social-
welfare/carers/carers-support-grant/) . This payment is not means tested and
you do not need to meet the habitual residence condition to qualify. You must
provide care for at least 6 months to qualify for this payment, and this
period must include the first Thursday in June.

If your child is aged under 16 and has a severe disability, you may qualify
for [ Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) . The child must need ongoing care and
attention, substantially more than is usually needed by a child of the same
age. It is not means tested.

You may also qualify for the [ Household Benefits Package ](/en/social-
welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/household-benefits-package/) (if you are
living with the person you are caring for) and [ free travel ](/en/social-
