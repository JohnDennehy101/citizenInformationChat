##  Caring for a child with a disability

If your child has a disability, or you think they may have a disability, you
should meet with your family doctor when you return to Ireland, (also known as
a GP) or a public health nurse. They can help you to access the services your
child needs. You can also [ make a referral yourself

Before returning to Ireland, ask your doctor for a copy of your childâ€™s
medical records, prescriptions for drugs and medicines and immunisation
records. If you have been seeing a consultant or specialist in a hospital
abroad, you should get a copy of your records sent to your GP in Ireland.

If you are not registered with a GP in Ireland, you can have these records
transferred to your GP when you register with one.
