###  Carer’s Benefit

Carer’s Benefit is a payment for people who leave work or reduce their hours
to care for a person in need of full-time care. You must be under 66 and have
paid enough [ social insurance (PRSI) contributions ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-
insurance/) .

If you paid social insurance in another EU member state or the UK, this may be
used to meet the contribution rules for Carer’s Benefit. But your most recent
social insurance contribution must be paid in Ireland.
