####  Applying from a hospital

If the person you are caring for is in hospital, they should ask the person
dealing with their discharge plan for a Home Support Application Form. This
person might be a nurse, a discharge coordinator or a social worker. They will
help them to complete the application form and send it to their local HSE Home
Support Office.

The HSE will then arrange a care needs assessment to see what support your
family member needs.

They should apply as soon as possible during their hospital stay to avoid
delays in their discharge home from hospital.
