###  Losing your job

If you are made redundant you should [ notify the Department of Enterprise,
Trade and Employment ](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/publications/notification-
of-dismissal-by-reason-of-redundancy-under-sections-20a-20b-of-the-employment-
permits-act-2006-as-amended-.html) . The Department will allow you 6 months to
find another job. When you find another job you will be issued with a new
Reactivation Employment Permit.

You must contact your local immigration registration office to confirm your
immigration status. If you have more than 6 months before your immigration
permission expires, you can reside in Ireland for 6 months. If you have less
than 6 months' immigration permission you can have your immigration permission
extended to 6 months which means you will have to pay for a new IRP. If you
have not found a new job after 6 months you may have to leave Ireland.

If you then get an offer of employment in Ireland, you can [ apply for a new
employment permit ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-
