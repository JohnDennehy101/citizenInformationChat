##  Introduction

If you had a valid employment permit and could not renew it through no fault
of your own, or because you were mistreated or exploited by your employer, you
may be able to get a Reactivation Employment Permit.

You must get permission from Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) and have a
valid Irish Residence Permit before you apply for the permit.

To get a Reactivation Employment Permit you must:

  * Have previously held an employment permit 
  * Be unemployed 
  * Have a job offer 
  * Have a temporary Stamp 1 immigration permission and a “Reactivation Employment Permit” letter from ISD. 

The Reactivation Employment Permit is available for all occupations, except
domestic jobs (other than [ certain carers ](https://dbei.gov.ie/en/What-We-
Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-
Eligibility/Carers-in-private-homes/) ).

A [ labour market needs test ](/en/moving-country/working-in-
ireland/employment-permits/work-permits#l27fdb) is not required.
