##  Buying a home when I return to Ireland

Before you look into buying a home, review your finances and decide what you
can afford to spend. Make sure you can cover all the [ costs involved in
buying a home ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-
home/buying-a-home/costs-of-buying-a-home/) , including legal fees, insurance,
[ stamp duty ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-
home/buying-a-home/stamp-duty/) , deposit, and monthly mortgage repayments.

If you apply for a mortgage, you will be asked for bank account statements and
proof of income. Lenders will also look at your credit history. This may
include your credit history both in Ireland and abroad. When returning to
Ireland, make sure to bring all relevant financial documentation with you.

You should get [ approval in principle
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/taking-out-a-mortgage/#b4a738) before you begin looking at
properties. The amount of money you can get as a mortgage loan, and the amount
you need as a deposit are governed by Central Bank lending limitsâ€”see [ Taking
out a mortgage ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-
home/help-with-buying-a-home/taking-out-a-mortgage/) for details of these
rules.

You can begin your search for properties online using accommodation websites
like daft.ie and myhome.ie. You can also contact estate agents in the area you
would like to live to ask about available properties. You can read about the [
