##  Renting when I return to Ireland

You may want to begin your search for rental accommodation before you return
to Ireland. You can do this by checking accommodation websites such as
daft.ie, myhome.ie, and rent.ie. You can search these websites using filters
such as price, location, and property size to find the accommodation you need.
Accommodation or letting agencies can also help you find private rented
accommodation, but they may charge a fee for this service.

You can also check the accommodation sections of newspapers, advertisements in
shops, and college notice boards. You may also find available accommodation
through word of mouth or 'To Let' signs on properties.

Before renting a property, you should view the accommodation in person and
meet your potential landlord, if possible. You may need to bring certain
documentation from the country you’re leaving, such as references from your
current landlord. Read about [ what to do when looking for a flat or house to
