##  Introduction

You will need somewhere to live when you move home to Ireland. You may be able
to stay with friends or family initially, or you may be in a position to rent
or buy a home immediately.

Irish citizens have an automatic right to live in Ireland. However, if you are
[ returning with a partner who is not a national of the EEA, UK or Switzerland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning_to_ireland/residency_and_citizenship/)
, they will need permission from Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) to live
with you in Ireland.

This page has information on how to find accommodation when you return to
Ireland, including how to buy or rent a home and how to access housing
supports if you need them.
