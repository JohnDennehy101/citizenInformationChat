##  Can I get help to pay my rent?

If you return home to Ireland and have difficulty paying rent, you can apply
for housing support from the State.

If you have a long-term housing need when you return, you can [ apply to your
local authority for social housing support
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/applying-for-local-authority-housing/) . You may have to [ show a
local connection ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-
ireland/finding-somewhere-to-live/guide-to-housing-supports-for-returning-
irish-emigrants/#f96325) to the area were you are applying for housing. In
some circumstances, this requirement can be waived.

If you qualify, you will be added to the social housing list. You may have to
wait a long time to be allocated social housing. While you are on the waiting
list, you can apply for the [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-
renting/housing-assistance-payment/) to help with the cost of renting
privately.
