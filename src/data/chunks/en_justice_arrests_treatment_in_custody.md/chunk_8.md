##  Visits and phonecalls

You may receive a visit from a relative, friend or any other person with an
interest in your welfare. You can refuse to see someone if you want.

The Garda in charge of the station must be satisfied that the visit can be
adequately supervised and will not delay the investigation of a crime or make
the investigation more difficult.

You can send a letter or make a telephone call, free of charge if the Garda in
charge is satisfied that it will not hinder or delay the investigation of
crime. A Garda can listen to the phone call and they can end it. They can also
read any letter and refuse to send it.

Before you have a supervised visit or communicate with a person other than
your solicitor, you must be informed that anything you say during the visit or
in the communication may be given in evidence.
