If you are 18 years or over and you have asked for a solicitor or that another
person be notified, the Garda in charge of the station must notify the
solicitor or other person as soon as possible.

If you are under 18 years of age, the Garda in charge of the station concerned
will, as soon as possible, inform your parent or guardian that you are in
custody, why you are in custody and that you have a right to consult a
solicitor.

If you are transferred to another station, your solicitor or other nominated
person must be notified of the transfer as soon as possible.
