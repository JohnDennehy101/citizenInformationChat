###  If your solicitor canâ€™t be reached

If the solicitor or other person cannot be contacted within a reasonable time
or if the solicitor or other person is unable to or unwilling to attend, you
must be given an opportunity to ask for another solicitor or another person.

If you have not had access to a solicitor, and a solicitor who has not been
requested is at the station, you must be given the opportunity to consult with
the solicitor if you wish.
