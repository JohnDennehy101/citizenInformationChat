##  Maximum working hours

The maximum number of hours you can work in an average working week is 48
hours. A working week can be more than 48 hours, it is the average that is
important. If you are **under 18** , there are different rules (see below).

The 48 hours of work **do not** include time spent on annual leave, sick
leave, maternity leave, adoptive leave, parental leave, carer's leave or force
majeure leave.

There are also special conditions for employees who work on Sundays â€“ see
'Sunday working and overtime' below.

For most employees, the law on working time and breaks is set out in the [
Organisation of Working Time Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html) \- see 'the
laws on work hours' below.
