###  Example

You have a standard working week of 40 hours (8 hours a day). You also do 12
hours of overtime a week for the first 10 weeks of your 4 month (17 weeks)
reference period. Follow these steps to calculate your average working hours:

  1. 17 weeks of 40 hours and 10 weeks of 12 hours overtime (17 x 40) + (10 x 12) = 800 (680+120) 
  2. 800 hours should be divided by 17 (the number of weeks in the reference period) 800 รท 17= 47.06 

So you would have worked an average of 47.06 hours per week. This would be
within the working time limits of 48 hours.
