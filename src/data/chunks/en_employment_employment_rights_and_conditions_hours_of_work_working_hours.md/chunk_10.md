###  If your employer refuses to put you on banded weekly hours

In some cases, your employer can refuse to put you on banded hours. For
example:

  * If there was no evidence to support your request 
  * If there were significant _adverse_ (negative) changes to the business during the 12-month reference period 
  * If there was a temporary situation that is now over 
  * If your hours are set out in a collective agreement 

If your request is refused and you are not satisfied with your employer’s
explanation, you can make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission
(WRC). See ‘How to make a complaint’ below.
