##  How to work out your average working hours

You get your average working hours by calculating the number of hours you work
each week and then averaging these hours over a set period (see table below).

The set period (or _reference period_ ) depends on the type of work you do and
any special agreements you have with your employer.

Different set periods for certain workers  **Set period** |  **Set period applies to:**  
---|---  
4 months  |  Most employees   
6 months  |  Employees working in:  • The security industry   
• Hospitals  
• Prisons  
• Gas and electricity  
• Airport and docks  
• Agriculture  
• Businesses which have ‘peak periods’ at certain times of the year (such as
tourism)  
12 months  |  Employees who have agreed to this with their employer (this must be approved by the Labour Court).
