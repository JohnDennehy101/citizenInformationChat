###  Time limits for making a complaint to the FSPO

A 6 year limit normally applies to all cases. This means the FSPO will not
investigate a case arising from events that happened over 6 years ago.

However, for _long term products_ , you can make a complaint to the Ombudsman
within any of the following limits:

  * 6 years from the date of your problem happening 
  * 3 years from the date on which you became aware (or when you should reasonably have become aware), that you had cause to complain 
  * Where the FSPO feels that there are reasonable grounds for a longer period and that it would be just and equitable in the circumstances to extend the time limit 

A _long term product_ is a financial product with a term of 5 years and 1
month or more, for example a mortgage.
