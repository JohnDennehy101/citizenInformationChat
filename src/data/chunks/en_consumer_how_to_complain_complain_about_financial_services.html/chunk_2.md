##  Introduction

If you have a complaint about a financial services firm, you should first
discuss your complaint with the firm itself.

All banks, insurance companies, brokers, investment companies or other
financial services firms must, by law, have a complaints handling process in
place for consumers.

If, after following the firmâ€™s complaints process, you are still not satisfied
with the response, you can refer the complaint to the [ Financial Services and
Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) ](https://www.fspo.ie/) . The FSPO is an
independent, statutory body that can investigate your complaint.
