##  Interest on loans or savings – EAR

The **_Equivalent Annual Rate_ ** **(EAR)** can be used to calculate interest
earned on an account that has money in it or interest charged on an account
that is overdrawn. For example, a current account with an overdraft facility
can have 2 EAR rates – one for interest paid when the account is in credit and
another for interest charged when the account is overdrawn. If only one EAR is
quoted you should find out whether it applies to your credit balance or your
overdraft. Always check the interest rate charged on your [ overdraft facility
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/loans-and-credit/overdrafts/) with your
bank.

EAR takes into account when the interest is charged or earned, and any
additional charges. Examples of additional charges are quarterly fees or set-
up charges.

EAR calculates the interest as if it is paid once a year, even if it is paid
twice or three times per year. This allows you to use EAR rates to compare an
account where the interest is paid or charged monthly with one where the
interest is paid or charged annually.

The higher the EAR, the more interest you will be charged or earn.
