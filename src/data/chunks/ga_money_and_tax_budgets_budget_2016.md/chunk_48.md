####  Revised CGT entrepreneur’s relief

A reduced rate of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is being introduced for individuals
who propose to sell their business. A lower CGT rate of 20% will apply to the
net chargeable gains arising on disposals of assets comprising the whole or a
discrete part of a trade or business, subject to a lifetime limit of €1
million on such gains, with effect from 1 January 2016.
