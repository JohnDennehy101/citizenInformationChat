####  Family Income Supplement (FIS)

Family Income Supplement thresholds will be increased by €5 for each of the
first two children per week. The threshold for the third and all other
children will increase by €10 (January 2016).

The level of FIS payment will continue to be based on 60% of the shortfall
between net weekly family income and the applicable weekly family threshold.
This measure will cost €18 million. It will benefit nearly 60,000 families and
over 131,000 children. It will also result in an additional 1,500 households
and 3,365 children becoming eligible for FIS.
