##  Introduction

Budget 2016 was announced on 13 October 2015.

The main Budget changes that may affect people living in Ireland are set out
below.

This document sets out changes in the areas of taxation, social welfare,
health, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is an overview and
not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget 2016.

**This document will be updated throughout the week as more details become

Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2016 or later in 2016. Many
others have to be finalised before coming into effect.

Some elements of these measures may change when the legislation required to
bring them into effect is enacted.
