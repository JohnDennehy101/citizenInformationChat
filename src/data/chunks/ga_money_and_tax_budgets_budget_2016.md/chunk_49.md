####  Reduced fees for card payments

Interchange fees are charged to retailers for both debit and credit card
transactions. To reduce the costs to retailers of accepting card payments, a
maximum fee limit is now being set on interchange for both debit and credit
cards. Both of these limits will come into force on 9 December 2015. Some
smaller schemes will be exempted from these new limits until 9 December 2016,
to give them time to restructure their business models as required.
