##  Who do I contact about defects in my apartment or duplex?

You should contact the [ owners management company (OMC) for your apartment or
duplex ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/management-companies-for-
apartment-blocks/) , if you think your property has a defect. The OMC should
get someone to inspect the issue so it can be fixed.

If it is an emergency fire safety issue, the OMC can apply for funding to get
it fixed under the Interim Remediation Scheme. Then, when the main scheme is
operational, the OMC will get funding through the scheme to do all the other
necessary remediation works to your building. The [ Housing Agency
](https://www.housingagency.ie/) will also provide information and advice
about the planned scheme once it begins.
