##  What is the planned scheme to fund fixing defects in apartments and
duplexes?

Many apartments and duplexes built between 1991 and 2013 have serious defects.
These include defects with fire safety, structural safety and water getting
into the property.

A [ new scheme will provide funding to fix these defects
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/b6817-government-approves-establishment-
of-defects-scheme-for-apartments-and-duplexes/) . Fixing these defects is
known as ‘remediation work’.

The Government is preparing legislation to bring the scheme into effect and it
is intended that it will start in 2024.

In the meantime, an Interim Remediation Scheme has been launched.
