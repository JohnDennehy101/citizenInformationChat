###  Work to fix fire safety defects

On 11 December 2023, the [ Interim Remediation Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/ede52-interim-remediation-scheme-for-fire-
safety-defects-in-apartments-and-duplexes/) was launched to fix emergency fire
safety issues. Your ownerâ€™s management company applies for funding to fix fire
safety defects under this scheme.

Before the interim scheme was launched it was agreed that remediation work
that began after 17 January 2023 to fix fire safety defects in these
apartments and duplexes would be included in the main scheme. This applies as
long as the work meets certain conditions and you agree on the remedial work
with the local authority fire services in advance.

This is being done to ensure that fire safety fixes are not postponed while
waiting for the scheme to begin.
