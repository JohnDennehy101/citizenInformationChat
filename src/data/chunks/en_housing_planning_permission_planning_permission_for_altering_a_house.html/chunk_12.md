##  Planning permission for a material change of use

If you want to make a “material change” to how you use your land or buildings,
you will need planning permission. A material change means a significant
change that will have an impact on your neighbours or your local community.

For example, you will need planning permission if you want to:

  * Convert your garage into a workshop for business use 
  * Open a crèche 
  * Open a bed and breakfast with more than 4 guest bedrooms 

You may also need to get planning permission if you are [ renting your
property for short-term lets ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/renting-
your-property-for-shortterm-lets/) .

There are some exceptions to the requirement for planning permission for a
material change of use. For example, you do not need planning permission to
change certain vacant commercial properties (including pubs) into homes.

These exceptions are set-out in the [ Planning and Development Regulations
2001 to 2023 (pdf) ](https://assets.gov.ie/135619/1ef55833-465c-48da-
