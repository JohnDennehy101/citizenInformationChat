###  Wind turbines and solar panels

You can install a wind turbine for domestic use as long as:

  * It is not attached to a structure 
  * It is not more than 13 metres high 
  * It has a rotor diameter of less than 6 metres 
  * There is a clearance of at least 3 metres between the tip of the rotor and the ground 

You do not need to get planning permission to fit solar panels to the roof of
your house. You can cover your whole roof with solar panels without needing
planning permission.

You can install freestanding solar panels at your house without needing
planning permission as long as:

  * They are not in front of the house's front wall 
  * They are less than 2.5 metres above ground 
  * They donâ€™t cover more than 25 square metres 
  * The private open space to the rear or side of the house is not reduced to less than 25 square metres 

**There are certain restrictions if your home is a protected structure or in
an architectural conservation area. Additional restrictions may also apply if
glare from your solar panels will be an issue.** **It is important to check
with your local authority for full details before making any changes to your
house.**
