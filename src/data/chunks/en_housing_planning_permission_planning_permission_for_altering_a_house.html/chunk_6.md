###  Front porches

You can build a front porch without getting planning permission as long as it:

  * Is not more than 2 square metres in area 
  * Is more than 2 metres from any public road or footpath 

If the porch has a tiled or slated pitched roof, it must not be higher than 4
metres, or 3 metres for any other type of roof.
