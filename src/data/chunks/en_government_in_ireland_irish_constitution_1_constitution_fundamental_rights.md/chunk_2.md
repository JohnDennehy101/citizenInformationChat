##  Introduction

[ The Irish Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) recognises and declares that people
living in Ireland have certain fundamental personal rights.

Articles 40 to 44 set out these fundamental rights. Many of the rights apply
to everyone living in Ireland, including non-Irish citizens.

The rights that are set out in these articles have been interpreted by the
courts, and some articles have been amended since the Constitution was written
in 1937. The courts have found that some rights are protected by the
Constitution, even though they are not explicitly mentioned in the text.

Fundamental rights are not absolute - they can be limited or restricted by the
Oireachtas for certain reasons (for the common good or to keep public order
for example).

If there is a conflict between two or more constitutional rights in a case,
the courts will look at all the circumstances and weigh all of the factors to
decide how that particular conflict is to be dealt with. For instance, there
is often a clash between one person’s right to freedom of expression and
another person’s right to their good name.
