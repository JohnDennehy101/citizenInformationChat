###  Trial by jury

Your constitutional right to trial by jury only exists in certain criminal
cases.

If you have been charged with a " [ non-minor" offence ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-offences/classification-of-crimes-in-criminal-cases/) , you will
be tried by a judge sitting with a jury. There are some offences for which you
will be given a choice - whether you want to have your case decided by a
District Court judge sitting alone or by a judge sitting with a jury.

The [ jury ](/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) must consist of those who have been
chosen at random from a diverse range of jurors from the community.
