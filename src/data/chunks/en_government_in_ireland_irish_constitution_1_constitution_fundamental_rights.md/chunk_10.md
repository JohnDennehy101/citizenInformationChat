###  The right to fair procedures

The courts and all public bodies or persons making decisions that affect your
constitutional rights must treat you fairly. Two of the essential components
of fair procedures in this context are:

  * The person making the decision that affects you should not be biased or appear to be biased. 
  * You must be given an adequate opportunity to present your case. You must be informed of the matter and you must be given a chance to comment on the material put forward by the other side.
