###  Inviolability of a citizen's dwelling

The Constitution declares that the dwelling of a citizen is _inviolable_ and
shall not be entered forcibly except in accordance with the law (Article
40.5). This means that no one, including the Garda√≠, may enter the place where
you live without a warrant or other legal authority to enter.

If you are arrested as a result of an unlawful entry into your home, your
arrest is illegal. [ Evidence ](/en/justice/evidence/unlawfully-obtained-
evidence/) obtained as a result of an unlawful entry onto your dwelling may be
inadmissible in court.
