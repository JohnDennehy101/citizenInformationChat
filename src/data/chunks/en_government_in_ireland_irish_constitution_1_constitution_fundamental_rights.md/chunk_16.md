##  The rights of the family

The family founded on marriage possesses a collection of constitutional rights
(Article 41 and 42). These include:

  * The right to marital privacy. 
  * The right of coupes to make their own decisions about family planning. 
  * The right to consort together, to enjoy each other's company and to procreate. This right may be limited or restricted where a [ family member is in prison ](/en/justice/prison-system/prisoners-rights/) or where one spouse is not an Irish citizen. The right of parents to be the main and natural educators of their children. The State must respect your right as parents to provide for the religious, moral, intellectual, physical and social education of your children. The State cannot oblige you to send your children to school or to any particular type of school but it may require that children receive a certain minimum education. 
  * The right to free primary education - this means that the State must contribute towards for your children's primary education. State aid for schools must not discriminate between schools of different religions. 
  * The right to decide the religion of your children. The State cannot interfere with this right. 

Many of these rights equally apply to non-marital families.

There is a constitutional principle that married parents have equal rights to
and are joint guardians of their children. If the parents separate or divorce,
the courts may decide who will have [ custody of the children ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/separation-and-divorce-children/)
. The paramount consideration is the welfare of the children.
