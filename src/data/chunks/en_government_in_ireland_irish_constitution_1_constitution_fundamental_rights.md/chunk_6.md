###  Personal liberty

The Constitution guarantees that you have a right to liberty and freedom,
except in accordance with the law (Article 40.4).

This means that, in general, you are entitled to your own personal freedom
except where regulated by law. In addition, the law may provide for your
detention in certain circumstances and the State may only breach your right to
personal liberty in circumstances that come within that law.

If you believe that you are being [ detained ](/en/justice/arrests/detention-
after-arrest/) or held unlawfully, you can make an application to the High
Court. If the person or institution detaining you cannot justify your
detention or prove that it is lawful, the High Court may order that you be
released. This is called a _habeas corpus_ order.

You have a right to move freely within the State. You also have a broader
right to travel and to get a passport for the purpose of travelling.

Your right to a passport may be restricted or limited. For example, before
granting you [ bail ](/en/justice/arrests/bail-and-surety/) , a court may
require you to hand over your passport. The State may also restrict your right
to travel abroad for the purposes of national security.
