###  Freedom of assembly

You have a right to assemble or meet peacefully and without weapons (Article
40.6.1.ii). This right is limited by legislation to protect public order and
morality. The law prevents or controls meetings that are calculated or
designed to cause a riot or breach of the peace or which may be a danger to
the general public.

There are other limitations on your freedom of assembly. You cannot meet on
private property without the consent of the owner - that is trespass. Parades
and processions are not illegal but it is a public nuisance to obstruct a
highway without authorisation.

You may not hold a procession or meeting within half a mile of the Houses of
the Oireachtas when a chief superintendent or higher ranking garda informs the
organisers of such an event that it is prohibited or where any garda within
that half-mile radius asks you to disperse.
