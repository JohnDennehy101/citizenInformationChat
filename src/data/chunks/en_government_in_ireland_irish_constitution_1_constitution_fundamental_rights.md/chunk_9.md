###  Freedom of association

The Constitution guarantees your right to form associations and [ unions
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/industrial-relations-and-
trade-unions/trade-unions/) (Article 40.6.1.iii). You may form any type of
association for whatever purpose you choose, whether it is sporting, social,
charitable, commercial or political.

This right is limited by legislation to protect public order and morality. For
example, associations formed for the purpose of treason or some anti-
constitutional or illegal purpose cannot rely on this right to freedom of
association.

Similarly, you canâ€™t force someone to join any particular association or union
or always force a union or association to accept you.
