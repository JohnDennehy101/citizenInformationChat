##  Property rights

The Constitution declares that the State will vindicate the property rights of
every citizen. This means that you have a right to own, transfer and inherit
property. You also have the right to [ bequeath property upon your death
](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/what-happens-the-deceaseds-estate/) . The
State guarantees to pass no law to abolish these rights.

Article 43 acknowledges that these rights ought to be regulated by the
principles of social justice. This means that the State may pass laws limiting
your right to private property in the interests of the common good. The most
common form of limitation is taxation on ownership, transfer and inheritance.

Other examples of restrictions or limitations on your right to own property
include town and regional planning, protection of national monuments,
compulsory acquisition of land.

If the State passes a law that otherwise restricts your property rights, it
may be required to compensate you for this restriction.
