####  **What are letting agencies?**

Letting agencies (sometimes called ‘accommodation agencies’) are commercial
organisations that can help you find private rented accommodation. They may
charge you a fee.

Before registering with an agency, you should find out the following:

  * Is the agency licensed? 
  * What services does it offer? 
  * If you pay a fee, in what circumstances will you get a refund? 
  * If you decide to register with the agency, make sure you get a receipt for any money you pay.
