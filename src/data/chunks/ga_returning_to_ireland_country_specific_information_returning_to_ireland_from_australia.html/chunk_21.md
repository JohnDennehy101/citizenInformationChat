###  **Private healthcare services**

Health insurance is used to pay for private care in hospital or from health
professionals in hospitals or in their practices.

The arrangements vary from one company to another, but most companies have
agreements with hospitals to pay the hospital directly. In general, for
outpatient costs you pay the health professional and then claim back from the
health insurance company. You should check with your own company as to their
procedures.
