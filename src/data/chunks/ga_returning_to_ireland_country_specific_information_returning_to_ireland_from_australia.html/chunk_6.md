####  **Deposit account**

A deposit account lets you build up savings and earn interest on this money.
Deposit accounts are offered by banks and credit unions. They are sometimes
called ‘savings accounts.’

For some accounts, you make deposits at regular times, usually monthly. These
are called ‘regular savings accounts.’

Before you open a deposit account, you should know what rate of interest you
can earn on your savings. You should also find out how you can access your
money if you need it. Some deposit accounts may have restrictions on how soon
or how often you can withdraw money.

A deposit account is not your only option. You can save money in other ways,
for example, through [ State Savings ](https://www.statesavings.ie/) .
