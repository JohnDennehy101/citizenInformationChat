##  Setting up an Irish bank account

Before you [ open a bank account in Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/banking/opening-a-bank-account/) , you need to provide:

  * [ Proof of identity ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/banking/financial-institutions-and-identification/) (such as a valid passport or driving licence) 
  * Proof of address (such as a recent utility bill). 

Some banks in Ireland offer [ ‘non-resident’ accounts
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/organising-your-
finances/banking-and-returning-to-ireland/#6b097b) . This means you might be
able to set up an Irish bank account before you return home. Different banks
have their own requirements, so you should contact your preferred bank
directly for advice.
