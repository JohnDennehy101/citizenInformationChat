###  **Primary and post-primary education**

Usually, children start primary school when they are 5 years of age. They
start in September – the beginning of the school year.There are 2 types of
primary schools in Ireland:

  * National primary schools (often called ‘national schools’) are funded by the State and do not charge fees 
  * Private primary schools, which charge fees. 

Most children in Ireland go to a State-funded national primary school.

Children usually start post-primary school when they are 12 or 13 years of
age.

There are 3 types of post-primary (or secondary) schools:

  * **Voluntary secondary schools** are privately owned and managed, usually by religious institutions, a charitable trust, or a private charitable company 
  * **Community colleges** that are managed by the local Education and Training Board (ETB) 
  * **Community schools** that were established by one or more private or religious patrons coming together and have ETB sponsorship or result from several voluntary secondary and ETB schools combining 

Most children attend State-funded post-primary schools which do not charge a
fee.
