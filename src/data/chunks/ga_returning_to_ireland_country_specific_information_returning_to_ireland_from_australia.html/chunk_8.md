###  **Managing your Australian tax**

It’s important to determine if you are an Australian resident for tax
purposes. You can use the ATO’s [ online tool for determining the residency
status of people leaving Australia ](https://www.ato.gov.au/single-page-
applications/calculatorsandtools?anchor=DORSLA#DORSLA/questions) .

If you're an Australian resident for tax purposes, you need to declare all
