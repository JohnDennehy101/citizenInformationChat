####  **What are the rules about deposits?**

You cannot be required to make upfront payments of more than 2 month’s rent.
This includes a deposit of a month’s rent and one month’s rent in advance.

You should get a receipt for any deposit you pay. Your [ rent book
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
and-responsibilities/rent-books/) should state how much of a deposit you paid.

You may lose your deposit if:  

  * You leave without giving proper notice, or leave before the end of a fixed-term lease 
  * You cause damage to the accommodation beyond [ normal wear and tear ](https://www.rtb.ie/during-a-tenancy/wear-and-tear)
  * You leave with bills or rent unpaid
