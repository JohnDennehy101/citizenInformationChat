###  **Public healthcare services**

The HSE delivers health and personal social services through medical
professionals and hospitals and through a network of [ Local Health Offices
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) , health centres, and clinics at
the community level.

You can access HSE public health services if you have been living in Ireland
for at least a year, or if you plan to live here for at least one year. This
is called being [ ordinarily resident in Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-
public-health-services/) .

To check that you are ordinarily resident, the HSE may ask for:

  * Proof of property purchase or rental, including evidence that the property is your principal residence (for example, proof of rent) 
  * A letter or statement from a financial institution (for example, a bank statement) 
  * A current utility bill (such as a gas, electricity, or phone bill) 
  * A current car or home insurance policy in your name 
  * An official document from a government department (for example, a notice of assessment from Revenue) 

The above documents need to be dated within the last 12 months.
