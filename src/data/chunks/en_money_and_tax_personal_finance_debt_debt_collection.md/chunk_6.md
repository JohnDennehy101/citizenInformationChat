##  Harassment and intimidation

All debt collectors, including private individuals and debt collection
agencies, are covered by [ Section 11 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the
Person Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/26/section/11/enacted/en/html#zza26y1997s11)
. Under the law, they cannot make a demand for payment of a debt if:

  * The demands are so frequent that they are expected to cause you or your family alarm, distress or humiliation 
  * They falsely suggest that non-payment will result in criminal proceedings 
  * They falsely suggest that they are authorised in an official capacity to enforce payment 
  * They use a false official document 

If your creditor or a debt collection agency does any of these things, you can
report it to [ An Garda Síochána ](http://www.garda.ie) . Anyone found guilty
of offences under the Act can be fined or sent to prison.
