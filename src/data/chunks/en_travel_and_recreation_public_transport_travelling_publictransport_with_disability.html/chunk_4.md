##  Travel Assistance Scheme

The [ Travel Assistance Scheme ](https://www.transportforireland.ie/travel-
assistance-scheme/) helps people with disabilities to use public transport in
the greater Dublin area and in Cork, Limerick and Waterford cities. The scheme
is free and is available for people over 18 years.

Under the scheme, a travel assistant can travel with you the first few times
you are travelling and offer advice on how to plan your journey. The assistant
will help you get used to travelling along that route on your own. You can
contact them when you are starting a new route.
