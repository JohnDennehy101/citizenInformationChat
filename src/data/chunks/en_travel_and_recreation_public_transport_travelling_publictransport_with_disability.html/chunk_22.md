###  Give details of your travel plans

When contacting the station include the following information:

  * Date and time of travel 
  * Departure station 
  * Arrival station and if you need to change trains on your journey 
  * The nature of your disability 
  * Assistance required 
  * How you will travel to and from departure and arrival stations such as taxi, private car and whether someone is meeting you at your destination 
  * If you will travel alone or with someone 
  * If you need help arriving or departing from the station 
  * Any other details to assist railway staff or details you would like to clarify 

If it is not possible to give notice to Irish Rail, they will do their best to
provide assistance. If there is a change or you need to cancel your plans, let
Irish Rail know. Staff can then assist others.
