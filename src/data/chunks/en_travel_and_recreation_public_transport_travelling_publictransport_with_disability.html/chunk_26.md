###  If you have a vision impairment

Most mainline and suburban and all DART stations have public address systems
giving details of trains and services for people with visual impairments.
Tactile tiles are in place in some stations to help people with visual
impairments. Braille-coded buttons and a talking lift are available in newer
station lifts.
