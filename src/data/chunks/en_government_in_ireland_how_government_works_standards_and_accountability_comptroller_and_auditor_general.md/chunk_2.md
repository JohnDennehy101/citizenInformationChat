##  Introduction

The [ Irish Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) states that a Comptroller and
Auditor General must be nominated by Dáil Eireann and appointed by the
President. The main function of the Comptroller and Auditor General is to
carry out an audit every year of the State's accounts. They then submit an
annual report of the audit to Dáil Eireann. The purpose of the audit is to
provide independent assurance that public funds are being well managed and
used legally.

The Comptroller and Auditor General is also the Supreme Audit Institution
(SAI) for Ireland. Supreme Audit Institutions in Ireland and abroad are linked
through a number of regional and international bodies:

  * [ The European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) ](http://www.eurosai.org/en/about-us/about-eurosai/)
  * [ The International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) ](http://www.intosai.org/)
