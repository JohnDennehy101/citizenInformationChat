###  Counterclaim

If the defendant wishes to make a claim against the plaintiff, this can be
done by adding a counterclaim section to the defence. This must clearly set
out the allegations that the defendant is making against the plaintiff and
what the defendant seeks from the court.

There is more information in Order 21 of the Rules of the Superior Courts.
