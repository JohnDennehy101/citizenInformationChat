##  Introduction

In the [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) , the person who
is bringing the case, that is, the person who is suing, is known as the
_plaintiff_ . The person who is being sued is known as the _defendant_ .

To commence proceedings, that is, to start a legal action, the plaintiff's [
barrister ](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) generally prepares an
_originating summons_ . The purpose of this document is to state the case
being made against the defendant.

When the defendant receives the summons, they must _enter an appearance_ to
show that they are now a party to the case.

Depending on the type of originating summons, the plaintiff may have to serve
a _statement of claim_ on the defendant. When the defendant has received the
statement of claim, they will issue a _defence_ , setting out why the
defendant is not to blame.

If the defendant believes that they actually have a claim against the
plaintiff, the defendant will include a _counterclaim_ with the defence
setting out their claim against the plaintiff.
