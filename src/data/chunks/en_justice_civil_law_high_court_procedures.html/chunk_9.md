###  Content of an originating summons

All originating summonses must contain the following information:

  * A title – the plaintiff's name and the defendant's name make up the title of the proceedings. 
  * The type of the summons, for example, plenary summons. 
  * A description of the parties – the summons must state the surname, first name, the residence or place of business and the occupation of the plaintiff. It must also state the name and address of the defendant (or their solicitor, if known). 
  * An [ indorsement of claim ](https://www.courts.ie/rules/indorsement-claim) – this is the part of the summons that sets out what the plaintiff claims they are entitled to. The level of detail necessary in this section depends on the type of summons. If the summons is a plenary summons, it is only necessary to give the defendant information about the general nature of the plaintiff's claim – more detail will be provided in the statement of claim that follows. If the summons is a summary summons or a special summons, much more detail must be given about the nature, extent and grounds of the plaintiff's claim against the defendant. It should clearly set out the allegations that are being made by the plaintiff and the amount that the plaintiff claims they are entitled to.
