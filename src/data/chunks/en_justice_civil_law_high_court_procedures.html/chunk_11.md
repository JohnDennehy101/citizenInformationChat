##  Entering an appearance

When a defendant receives a plenary or a summary summons they should enter an
appearance within 8 days. This time limit is not strict and, in most cases, an
appearance can be entered after the time has expired.

When a defendant receives a special summons they may enter an appearance at
any time. They will not be heard at any proceedings unless they have entered
an appearance.

Entering an appearance is a very important step as it indicates that the
defendant intends to defend the proceedings.

If the defendant fails to enter an appearance, the plaintiff can apply to
court for [ judgment in default of appearance
](https://courts.ie/rules/default-appearance) . This means that because the
defendant has failed to acknowledge the proceedings and indicate that they
intend to defend them, the plaintiff may obtain a judgment from the court
against the defendant without the need for a trial.

To enter an appearance, the defendant must lodge a [ memorandum of appearance
](https://courts.ie/content/originating-summons-appearance#_mon9) at the
Central Office. The plaintiff's solicitor must then be notified by the
defendant that an appearance has been entered.
