](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/assist-us/drug-and-tobacco-
smuggling/customs-drugs-watch.aspx) to identify possible drug smuggling routes
and to identify suspicious people who may be involved in drug trafficking.
Maritime and drug detector dog units are placed at major ports, airports, and
other coastal locations nationwide to detect and prevent drug smuggling.
