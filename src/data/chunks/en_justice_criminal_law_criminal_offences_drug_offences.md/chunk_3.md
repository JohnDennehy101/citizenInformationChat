##  What is a controlled drug?

A controlled drug is an illegal substance, product or preparation that has
been specified in the [ Misuse of Drugs Act 1977
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0012/index.html) or [ Misuse
of Drugs Regulations
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/ResultsTitle.html?q=misuse+drugs+regulations)
. The law has been updated several times.

The [ Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0022/sec0020.html#sec20) also
covers substances which are not specifically banned under the Misuse of Drugs
Acts, but which have psychoactive effects.

Controlled drugs also include certain tablets and medicines that can be
purchased on prescription. It is an offence to possess these drugs if you do
not have a prescription.

Some of the most common controlled drugs seized in Ireland include:

  * Cannabis 
  * Cocaine 
  * Heroin 
  * LSD 
  * Amphetamines
