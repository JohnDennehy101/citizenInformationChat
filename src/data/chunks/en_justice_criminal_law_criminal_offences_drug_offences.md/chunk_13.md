####  **Where the market value is €13,000 or more**

You are liable to a minimum prison sentence of 10 years, if you are convicted
for either:

  * Possessing drugs with a market value of €13,000 or more, or 
  * Importing drugs with a market value of €13,000 or more 

However, if the court decides that there are exceptional circumstances in your
case, this minimum sentence does not apply.
