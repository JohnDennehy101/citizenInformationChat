##  Combating drug use and drug trafficking

There are a number of Garda units and other initiatives aimed at combating
drug abuse and drug trafficking internationally and locally.

These include:

  * The [ Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau ](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-us/organised-serious-crime/garda-national-drugs-and-organised-crime-bureau/) which targets national and international drugs trafficking 
  * The [ Criminal Assets Bureau ](https://www.cab.ie/) which seizes the assets of people who have been convicted of drug trafficking 
  * Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces in areas with the highest levels of drug use 
  * [ Garda juvenile liaison (pdf) ](https://www.garda.ie/en/crime-prevention/community-engagement/community-engagement-offices/garda-youth-diversion-bureau/juvenile-liaison-officers.pdf) officers who work with young people to try and prevent them from getting involved with drugs 
  * [ Community Policing ](https://www.garda.ie/en/crime-prevention/community-policing/) initiatives to tackle drug problems in local communities 
  * Awareness-raising programmes such as the [ Garda Schools Programme ](https://www.garda.ie/en/crime-prevention/community-engagement/community-engagement-offices/) and the [ Garda Youth Diversion Programme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/children-and-young-offenders/garda-juvenile-diversion-programme/)
