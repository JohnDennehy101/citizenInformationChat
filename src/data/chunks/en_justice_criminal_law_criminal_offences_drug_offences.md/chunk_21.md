###  **Attempting or helping others to commit an offence**

If you attempt to commit a drug offence covered by law, or if you help or
incite someone else to commit a drug offence, you are guilty of an offence.

If found guilty of this, you are liable to be sentenced as if you had
committed the drug offence yourself.
