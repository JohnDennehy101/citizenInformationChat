####  **Reviewing your detention in a custodial treatment centre**

If you have been sent to a custodial treatment centre by a court order, you
can make an application to the court that detention is no longer in your best
interest or in the best interests of other people at the centre.

Based on this application, the court can review your case and revoke the
detention order.

It can then decide to:

  * Order your continued detention, possibly in another treatment centre, if the court decides you still need treatment 
  * Order that you continue treatment, but not in a custodial detention centre 
  * Impose the usual penalties for your offence, such as a prison sentence or fine (if a prison sentence is imposed, the court must take into account the time you have already been detained in a treatment centre) 
  * Not impose any further penalties if the court is satisfied that you no longer need treatment and that your case warrants no further penalties
