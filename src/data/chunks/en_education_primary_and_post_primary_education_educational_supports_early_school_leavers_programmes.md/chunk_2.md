##  Are you an early school leaver?

You are an early school leaver if you stop going to school school before
reaching the age of 16 years or before completing 3 years post-primary
education, whichever is later.

Young people who leave school without a recognised qualification are at a
disadvantage in the labour market and are at increased risk of poverty and
social exclusion.

  
If you have left school early and would like to get further education and
training, there are a number of supports in place. These are non-formal
education facilities that aim to provide high quality, relevant and efficient
education and training opportunities outside the mainstream education setting.
