###  School completion programme

The [ School Completion Programme (SCP)
](https://www.tusla.ie/services/educational-welfare-services/scp/) helps
students from disadvantaged areas stay in school to complete their Leaving
Certificate.

SCP is part of the Department of Education social inclusion strategy [
Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/4018ea-deis-delivering-equality-of-
opportunity-in-schools/) which helps children and young people at risk of [
educational disadvantage ](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-
education/attendance-and-discipline-in-schools/school-attendance/) to have
better opportunities.

Each project is managed by a local management committee and provides a
tailored programme of in-school, after school and holiday-time interventions
to targeted children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving.
