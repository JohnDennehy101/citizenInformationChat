####  Second reading

If the proposal has been sent back to Parliament for a second reading,
Parliament may approve or reject it, or may propose amendments and send it
back to the Council for a second reading.

If Council does not accept these changes, a **Conciliation Committee** is
formed from an equal number of MEPs and Council representatives. This
Committee tries to agree on a text. If it succeeds, the proposal is sent back
to the Parliament and Councils for third readings **.**

At this stage, the text of the proposal cannot be amended. **It must be passed
by both the Parliament and the Council to pass into law** .
