####  First reading

The proposed law is sent to the European Parliament for its first reading, and
is given to the relevant committee to examine. Amendments may be made to the
proposed law. The European Parliament votes to either:

  * Approve the proposal 
  * Approve the proposal with amendments 
  * Reject the proposal 

This is known as the _parliament’s first reading position_ .

At the same time, the proposal is also sent to the Council of the European
Union for its first reading. The Council takes its position (the _council’s
position_ ) after the parliament’s position is known. At this stage, the
Council can:

  * Approve the proposal by a _qualified majority_ . This may involve the Council accepting any amendments approved by the European Parliament. 
  * Take a 1st reading position of its own. This may be because it disagrees with some parts of the proposal, or the Parliament’s amendments. In this instance, the proposal is sent back to Parliament with reasons and explanations. 
  * Reject the proposal by a qualified majority.
