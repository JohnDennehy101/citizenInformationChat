##  Types of EU Law

**_Treaties_ ** are the fundamental laws of the EU. All treaties must be
ratified (passed and agreed) by member states.

Treaties set out the rules for how the institutions of the EU function. The EU
was founded on a number of treaties, and its expansion and development has
been underpinned by the agreement of treaties between the member states.

[ **_The European Charter of Fundamental Rights_ ** ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/eu-law/charter-of-fundamental-rights/) has the
same legal value as the treaties.

**_Regulations_ ** are laws that apply to all member states. They become part
of national law and can be enforced through the national courts of each member
state from the time they come into force.

**_Directives_ ** are laws that set goals for member states to implement.
Member states can introduce laws that _transpose_ directives into national
law. Directives normally have deadlines for countries to adopt them into
national law.

**_Decisions_ ** are only relevant to specified bodies. For example, the EU
Commission might issue a decision that Ireland is acting in breach of EU law.
The decision has a direct effect on the country, company or organisation that
the decision is issued against.

**_Recommendations_ ** and **_Opinions_ ** are not binding, and EU member
states can follow the advice of these recommendations if they wish to or they
can choose not to change anything.
