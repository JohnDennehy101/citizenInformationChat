##  Debt Relief Notice

The Debt Relief Notice (DRN) process provides debt relief for people who have
virtually no disposable income or assets and no prospect of being able to pay
off the debt in the next 3 years. If a DRN is issued for you, it will allow
for the write-off of your qualifying debt up to â‚¬35,000 subject to a 3-year
supervision period.

During this period your creditors will not be able to pursue you for payment,
but if your circumstances improve during the 3 years, you may have to pay part
of your debts accordingly. At the end of the 3 years, all of the debts covered
by the DRN will be written off, even if you have not managed to pay anything
off them.
