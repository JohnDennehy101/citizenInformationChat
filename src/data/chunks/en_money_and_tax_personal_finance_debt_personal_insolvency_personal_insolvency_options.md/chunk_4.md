###  Limits on usage

You can be involved in only one of the 3 procedures (DRN, DSA or PIA) or in
the bankruptcy process at any one time. If you use one of these 4 processes,
you will generally have to wait some years before applying to use another.

You may use each of the 3 procedures only once in your lifetime. (There is no
such limit on bankruptcy but it would be rare for anyone to go bankrupt
twice.)
