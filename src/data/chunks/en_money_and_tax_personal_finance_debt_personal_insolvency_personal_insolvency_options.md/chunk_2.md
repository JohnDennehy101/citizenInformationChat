##  Introduction

There are 3 debt resolution procedures to help mortgage-holders and other
people with unsustainable debt to reach agreements with their creditors. These
procedures offer different solutions to people in different situations. Each
option has its own rules and procedures.

One important issue is whether your debts are secured or not. _Secured_ _debt_
means debt backed by an asset, for example, a mortgage. _Unsecured debt_
includes debts on credit cards, loans and overdrafts.

The 3 debt resolution procedures are:

  * A Debt Relief Notice (DRN) to allow for the write-off of debt (generally unsecured and in some cases secured) up to €35,000, with a 3-year supervision period 
  * A Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt, with no limit involved, normally over a period of 5 years 
  * A Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) for the agreed settlement of secured debt up to €3 million (though this cap can be increased) and unsecured debt, with no limit involved, normally over a period of up to 6 years 

These procedures were introduced by the [ Personal Insolvency Act 2012
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2012/act/44/revised/en/html) and are
described in more detail below.

If you have tried to solve your debt problems with these procedures but they
are not suitable you can apply for bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a formal High
Court process for people with debt over €20,000.
