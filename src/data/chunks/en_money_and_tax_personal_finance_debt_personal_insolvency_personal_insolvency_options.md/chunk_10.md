##  Debt Settlement Arrangement

A Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) provides for the agreed settlement of
unsecured debt with one or more creditors over a period of 5 years, with a
possible agreed extension to 6 years.

You may apply for a DSA if the levels of your income, assets and debts mean
that you are not eligible for a Debt Relief Notice. You must be able to make
some repayments to your creditors in return for a discount of your debts. The
DSA is a voluntary arrangement and it will have to get the support of
creditors representing at least 65% of your total debt.

You must apply through a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP). This is a
professional who is approved and registered by the Insolvency Service of
Ireland to operate DSAs and Personal Insolvency Arrangements â€“ see [ How to
apply ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-
insolvency-options#ld1a9a) below.

When the agreed period ends, and if your DSA has operated successfully, you
will be discharged from the debts that it covered. This means that the debts
will be written off.
