##  Personal Insolvency Arrangement

A Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) provides for the agreed settlement of
secured debt up to a limit of €3 million (although this limit may be increased
with the agreement of all secured creditors) and an unlimited amount of
unsecured debt. A PIA will run over a period of up to 6 years, with a possible
agreed extension to 7 years.

The PIA works like a Debt Settlement Arrangement in the following ways:

  * You must apply through a Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) – see [ How to apply ](personal_insolvency_options.en.html#ld1a9a) below 
  * You must be able to make some repayments to your creditors in return for a discount of your debts 
  * It is a voluntary arrangement and must get the support of creditors – both secured and unsecured – representing at least 65% of your total debt 

In addition, over 50% of your secured creditors and 50% of unsecured creditors
must vote in favour. However, if a mortgage lender rejects the personal
insolvency proposal you can apply for a court review of the rejection.

Abhaile, an [ aid and advice scheme ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-
arrears/abhaile-mortgage-arrears-support/) for people in serious mortgage
arrears provides for free legal representation for eligible borrowers in
seeking such a review.

When the agreed period ends, and if your PIA has operated successfully, you
will be discharged from the unsecured debts that it covered but the secured
debt will only be discharged to the extent specified in the PIA.
