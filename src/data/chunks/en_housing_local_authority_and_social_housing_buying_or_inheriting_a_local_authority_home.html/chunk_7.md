####  **Does my social home qualify for the scheme?**

Some [ social homes are excluded
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/484/made/en/print) from the
scheme and are not available for tenants to buy. For example, you cannot buy
your social home if it was:

  * Designed for an older person to live in 
  * Provided for someone with a disability, who is moving from institutional care to living in the community 
  * Designed for a member of the Traveller community to live in 
  * Provided to your local authority by a developer under [ Part V arrangements ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2000/act/30/enacted/en/print#partv) . This is where private housing developers allocate a percentage of their land for social housing. 

Your local authority can also decide not to sell your social home to you for
other reasons. For example, if they do not think it is the best way to manage
their social housing stock in the area.
