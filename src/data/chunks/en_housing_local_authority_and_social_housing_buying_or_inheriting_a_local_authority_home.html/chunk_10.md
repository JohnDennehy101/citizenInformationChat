####  Do I qualify for the Tenant Purchase of Apartments Scheme?

An apartment complex must meet these criteria to be set aside for tenant
purchase:

  * Have at least 5 apartments (other than community apartments) 
  * Not contain retail units or apartments designed for older people 
  * Satisfy criteria set out in [ Section 51 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/22/section/51/enacted/en/html#sec51)
  * At least 65% of the tenants must support the proposal that the complex is made available for tenant purchase. A tenant vote must be held to determine this. 

When apartments are being sold in a designated complex, the local authority
transfers ownership of the entire complex to an apartment ownersâ€™ [ management
company ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/management-companies-for-
apartment-blocks/) . The management company immediately leases all the
apartments back to the authority for continued letting to tenants, who will
then have the option of buying them from the authority.
