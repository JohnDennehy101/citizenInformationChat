##  Introduction

You can buy or inherit a local authority home in certain circumstances.

There are [ schemes ](http://staging.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-
authority-and-social-housing/buying-or-inheriting-a-local-authority-
home/#d25023) to help you buy your local authority home. If you qualify, they
let you buy the home at a discounted rate.

If a close family member has a local authority home and dies, you may be able
to inherit their tenancy. You must meet certain criteria to qualify for this.

The exact rules for inheriting a tenancy can vary from one local authority to
another. They are outlined in your local authority's housing allocations
scheme, which you can find on your [ local authorityâ€™s website
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) .
