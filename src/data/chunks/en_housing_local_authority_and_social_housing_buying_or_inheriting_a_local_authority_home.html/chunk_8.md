####  How much will my home cost and are there charges?

You will get a discount of 40% to 60% off the purchase price of the house,
depending on your income. The local authority will put an incremental purchase
charge on your house.

This charge is equal to the discount you got on the price of the house. This
charge will be reduced by 2% each year, until no charge remains after a
specified number of years. This applies unless you resell the house, or break
the terms and conditions of the scheme during this specified period (20, 25 or
30 years).

If you sell the house within this specified period, you will have to pay the
outstanding incremental charge on the house to the local authority.

This table shows the percentage discount you can get on the purchase price
depending on your income and the number of years until the incremental charge
ends.

**Your income** |  **The % discount on the purchase price** |  **Number of years until the charge is complete**  
---|---|---  
€20,000 or less  |  60%  |  30 years   
Between €20,001 and €29,999  |  50%  |  25 years   
€30,000 or more  |  40%  |  20 years
