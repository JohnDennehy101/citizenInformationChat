##  Buying your local authority home

If you are a tenant in a local authority home, you may be able to buy your
home from the local authority at a discounted rate. There have been a number
of schemes over the years to help you do this, including the:

  * Incremental Tenant Purchase Scheme for existing local authority houses, 2016 
  * Tenant Purchase of Apartments Scheme (TPAS) 
  * Incremental Purchase Scheme for newly built houses, 2010 
  * Tenant Purchase Scheme, 1995 (closed to new applicants)
