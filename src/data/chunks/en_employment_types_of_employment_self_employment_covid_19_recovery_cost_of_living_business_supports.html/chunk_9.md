###  Ukraine Enterprise Crisis Scheme

The Ukraine Enterprise Crisis Scheme helped viable but vulnerable firms of all
sizes in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.

There are two streams of funding under the Scheme. You could apply under:

  * Stream 1 for grants up to â‚¬500,00 to help if you are having trading difficulties caused by liquidity problems as a result of the war in Ukraine. In March 2023 the maximum aid level was increased to 2 million. Stream 1 closed on 31 December 2023. 

  * Stream 2 for state aid support of 30% of energy charges in 2022 if you are an energy intensive company experiencing severe increases in energy costs. In March 2023 the maximum aid level was increased to 4 million. Stream 2 closed on 31 March 2024.
