##  Your rights as a housing association tenant

If you are renting from an [ approved housing body (AHB)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) , your tenancy comes under the residential
tenancies legislation and you have most of the same rights that private
tenants have. However, there are some differences:

  * You may not assign or sublet the tenancy 
  * [ Rent reviews ](https://www.rtb.ie/during-a-tenancy/approved-housing-bodies-rent-reviews) will take place in line with your tenancy agreement. If you do not have a tenancy agreement, your rent should not be reviewed more than once a year 
  * Most AHB tenants will get [ security of tenure ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/types-of-tenancy/) after 6 months in the tenancy. Security of tenure means that you can stay in the property for a set amount of time. However, this does not apply if you are living in transitional accommodation and the tenancy is for 18 months or less 
  * The landlordâ€™s right to [ terminate a tenancy after 6 months ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/) because they, or a family member needs to live in the property, does not apply to AHB tenancies 
  * The [ minimum standards ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/minimum-standards-for-rented-homes/) for food preparation, storage and laundry purposes do not apply to AHBs, so they do not have to provide their tenants with white goods, such as washing machines
