are known as postnatal check-ups. Your postnatal check and your baby's 6-week
check can be done by your GP during the same appointment.

There are many [ physical and emotional symptoms you may experience after
giving birth ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/pregnancy-and-birth/birth/health-

to recover.

feel worried about any of these symptoms or that something is not right.
