###  The 6-week check

You can either go to your GP or your maternity hospital for the 6-week check.

Your GP or hospital paediatrician will examine your baby to check their
development. They will check your baby's weight, length, head circumference
and hips. They will also discuss your baby's feeding patterns and general
health with you, and allow you to discuss any concerns you might have.

Your public health nurse (PHN) will continue to carry out [ developmental
checks on your child ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/babies-and-
children/checks-milestones/developmental-checks/overview/) at different
stages:

  * [ 6 months ](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/health-checks/until-6-months/)
  * [ 6 to 11 months ](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/health-checks/6-12-months/)
  * [ 18 to 24 months ](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/health-checks/1-2-years/)
  * [ 3-5 years ](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/checks-milestones/health-checks/3-5-years/)

Developmental checks find out if your child is growing properly. They also
check if your child is able to do things that children of the same age are
able to do.

These checks are sometimes called _examinations_ . Your Public Health Nurse
will contact you to arrange a time for each of these appointments when they
are due.

If you or your Public Health Nurse have any concerns they may ask you or your
child to come back for another check, or they might also refer you and your
child to a specialist for further assessment.
