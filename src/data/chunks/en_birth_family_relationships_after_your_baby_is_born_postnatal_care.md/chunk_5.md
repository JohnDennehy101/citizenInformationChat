##  Protecting your mental health

You may experience emotional symptoms after giving birth. This is quite normal
after having a baby and is sometimes called ‘the baby blues’. You can discuss
your feelings with your doctor during your appointment.

You can also contact your GP, midwife or public health nurse before your
postnatal check-up if you feel worried about your mental health or that
something is not right. [ Postnatal depression
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/mental-health/postnatal-depression/postnatal-
depression.html) affects 10 to 15% of women within the first year of giving
birth. Whether you have mild or severe symptoms, there are [ postnatal
supports ](/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/supports-
for-postnatal-depression/) available to help.
