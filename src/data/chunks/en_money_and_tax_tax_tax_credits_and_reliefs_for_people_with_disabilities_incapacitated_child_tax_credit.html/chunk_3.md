##  Qualifying criteria

To qualify, your child must have a physical or mental incapacity that makes it
unlikely for them to be able to maintain themselves, even with the benefit of
any:

  * Treatment 
  * Device 
  * Medication 
  * Therapy 

There must be an expectation that if the child were over 18, they would not be
able to maintain themselves. 'Maintaining' means the ability to support
themselves by earning an income from working.
