##  Introduction

The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides some free dental treatment through
the public health service. Services are provided by dentists employed by [
Local Health Offices ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) in your
area and by private dentists who have contracts with the HSE to provide
certain services.

If you do not qualify for HSE services, then you can use a private dental
service.
