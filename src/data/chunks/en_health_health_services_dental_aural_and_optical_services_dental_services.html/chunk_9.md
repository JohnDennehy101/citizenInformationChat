###  Orthodontic treatment

The HSE provides free orthodontic treatment for children who have the most
severe orthodontic problems. The criteria used to decide whether a child
qualifies is based on an international grading system called the Index of
Orthodontic Treatment Need.

HSE dental surgeons can advise on eligibility and refer you to the local HSE
orthodontic unit for assessment if appropriate. The types of orthodontic
problems that qualify under the guidelines include front teeth that are buried
and fail to emerge, multiple missing teeth, very prominent front teeth or
severe problems with the bite or jaw development.
