###  Routine dental treatment

All children in certain classes in primary school and children with special
needs are offered an appointment for a free dental exam. A follow up
appointment will be made with your local HSE Dental Clinic if needed.

Children outside of these classes will only be seen by the HSE Dental Clinic
for emergency treatment.
