##  Private patients

If you do not qualify for HSE services, you can use a private dental service.

Dentists must display private fees in a place where patients can view them
before consultation. A single fee must apply for some procedures while the
fees for others may be shown as a range, with a minimum and maximum clearly
stated. Where a range of fees applies, it is not permitted to set a minimum
price only.

The Dental Council has produced a [ Code of Practice relating to: Display of
Private Fees in Dental Practices (pdf) ](https://www.dentalcouncil.ie/wp-
