###  Medical card holders

The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) provides access to dental
treatment for adult [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) holders (aged 16 or over).

Medical card holders are entitled to a free dental examination in each
calendar year, as well as any extractions that are required. One first-stage
endodontic (root canal) treatment is also available each year for teeth at the
front of the mouth.

Two fillings are free in each calendar year. For a filling on a tooth that has
already been filled in the last 5 years, the dentist must seek approval from
the local HSE Principal Dental Surgeon detailing why it is clinically
necessary to repeat the filling.

Denture repairs, the control of haemorrhage and the issuing of prescriptions
will be covered where required.

All other treatments, including providing dentures, require the prior approval
of the local HSE Principal Dental Surgeon.
