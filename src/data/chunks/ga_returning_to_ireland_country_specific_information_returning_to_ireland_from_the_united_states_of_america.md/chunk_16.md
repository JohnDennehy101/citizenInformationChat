###  **Taxes in Ireland**

In Ireland, the percentage of tax you pay depends on your income.

The first part of your income, up to a certain amount, is taxed at 20%. This
is known as the _standard rate of tax_ and the amount that it applies to is
known as the _standard rate tax band_ .

The rest of your income is taxed at the _higher rate of tax_ , 40%.

The amount that you can earn before you start to pay the higher rate of tax is
known as your _standard rate cut-off point_ . You can see [ examples of how to
calculate income tax ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/case-study-calculating-your-income-tax-case-studies/) using
these tax rates and the standard rate cut-off point. There is also a [ graph
