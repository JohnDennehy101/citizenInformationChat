###  **Renting a home**

In Ireland, the term “renting” is usually used in everyday conversation.
Sometimes, you might hear words like “tenancy agreement” and “lease” used as
well.

Consider these questions before viewing places to rent:

  * How much can you afford in rent and bills? 
  * What is the standard of the accommodation? 
  * What is the [ Building Energy Rating (BER) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/getting-a-building-energy-rating-for-your-home/) of the property? 
  * Where is the property located? Is it near your work or college? 
  * How long do you plan to stay there? 
  * Do you want to share a bedroom, bathroom or kitchen?
