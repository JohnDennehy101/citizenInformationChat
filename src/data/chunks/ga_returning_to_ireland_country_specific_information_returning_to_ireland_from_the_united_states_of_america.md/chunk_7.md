###  **Opening a bank account**

Before you [ open a bank account in Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/banking/opening-a-bank-account/) , you need to show both:

  * [ Proof of identity ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/banking/financial-institutions-and-identification/) (such as a valid passport or driving licence) 
  * Proof of address (such as a recent utility bill). 

In general, this means you can’t open an Irish bank account until you have
arrived home. See ‘Non-resident bank accounts below’ for more details.

**Non-resident bank accounts**

Some banks in Ireland offer ‘non-resident’ accounts. This means you may be
able to set up an Irish bank account before you return home.

You still need to prove your identity (this requirement is set out in [ anti-
money laundering legislation ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-
and-tax/personal-finance/banking/money-laundering-in-ireland/) ), but the bank
may, for example, accept a foreign utility bill, if it has been certified by a
solicitor or police officer.

Different banks have their own requirements, so you should contact your
preferred bank directly for advice.
