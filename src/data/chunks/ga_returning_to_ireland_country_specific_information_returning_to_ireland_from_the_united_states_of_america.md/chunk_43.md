####  **Finding a school**

You can find primary and post-primary schools by type and location using the
Department of Educationâ€™s [ Find a School tool
](https://www.education.ie/en/Find-a-School/) . This tool can filter your
search results by ethos, language of instruction, and gender. You will see a
map showing schools that meet your selection.

Most schools have a website with information about their ethos, policies,
curriculum, and extra-curricular activities on offer. You can also contact a
school directly for more information.
