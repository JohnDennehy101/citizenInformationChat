##  What is a cohabitation agreement?

If you live with your partner but you do not intend to marry, you should
protect your financial interests by entering into a ‘ _cohabitation agreement_
’ (also called a cohabitant’s agreement). This is a voluntary, signed
agreement, which allows you to specify the day-to-day joint financial
arrangements of your relationship, such as:

  * The payment of joint debts 
  * The payment of common household expenses 

You can also specify how you plan to separate your assets, such as shared
property, should the relationship come to an end. In the event of a break-up,
a cohabitation agreement can make the division of your assets more
straightforward.

Your cohabitation agreement may include a provision that the redress scheme
does not apply to you (for example, you can both agree not to apply for a
maintenance order should your relationship end). This is different from
similar agreements by married couples. Agreements between married couples
cannot exclude either party’s right to apply to the courts for various orders
(for example, a maintenance order).
