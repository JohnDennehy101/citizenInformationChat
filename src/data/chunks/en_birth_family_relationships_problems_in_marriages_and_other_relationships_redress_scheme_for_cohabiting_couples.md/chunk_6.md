###  What the court will consider

When making a decision, the court must consider a number of factors,
including:

  * The financial circumstances, needs and obligations of you and your former partner 
  * The rights of others (including the rights of spouses, former spouses, civil partners, former civil partners and dependent children of either partner) 
  * The length and nature of the relationship 
  * The contributions made by each of you, financial and otherwise 

Court orders may not affect the rights of spouses or former spouses. They may
affect the rights of civil partners or former civil partners.
