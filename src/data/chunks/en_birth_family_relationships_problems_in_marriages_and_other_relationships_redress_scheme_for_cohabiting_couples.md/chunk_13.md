###  Is a cohabitation agreement valid in court?

If you and your partner make a cohabitation agreement (an agreement on joint
financial matters), it is only valid if:

  * Each of you has had independent legal advice, or you got legal advice together and have waived the right to independent legal advice (see ‘More information’ below) 
  * The agreement is a contract 
  * The agreement has been signed by each of you 

In exceptional circumstances, the court may set aside or vary (change) your
cohabitation agreement (for example, if the enforcement of the agreement would
cause serious injustice).

If you and your cohabitant entered into an agreement before the 2010 Act
commenced, it is enforceable.
