####  Property adjustment orders and tax

Where a property adjustment order is made, there are no [ capital gains tax
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-gains-tax/) , [ gift or
inheritance tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-
tax/) issues for either you or your former partner on the transfer, and no
stamp duty is payable.

However, when the property is disposed of at a later date, the total period of
ownership of the property (by both of you) is taken into consideration for the
purposes of determining whether any capital gains tax is payable.
