###  When your Advance Healthcare Directive may not be followed

If your AHD does not apply to the exact circumstances you face, it may not be
applied. For example, you may refuse amputation in certain circumstances.
However, if you need an amputation in other circumstances not dealt with in
your AHD, then the AHD may not apply.

If your AHD includes doing something which is illegal, it cannot be carried
out. For example, if you write that you want to be given medication which will
lead to your death. Deciding to refuse a treatment is not the same as asking
someone to end your life or help you end your life.
