##  Are Advance Healthcare Directives legally binding?

If you are refusing certain medical and surgical treatments, this can be
legally binding if you lose capacity and the treatment proposed is the same as
that set out in your AHD.

You may want to refuse a treatment in some situations, but not others. If this
is the case, you need to be clear about all the circumstances in which you do
not want this treatment.

The AHD may also not apply if you, after making the AHD and when you have
capacity, do something contrary to the AHD, such as consenting to a form of
treatment which you state in your AHD that you do not want.

If you want your ADH to apply to life-sustaining treatment, this must be
clearly stated and in the ADH.

If you are requesting a future treatment you would like to receive in your
Advance Healthcare Directive, it will not be legally binding on those treating
you. However, the treatment you would like must be taken into consideration by
the medical team treating you if the treatment is relevant to your medical
condition.
