##  Introduction

The Court of Appeal is the second highest tier in the [ Irish courts system
](/en/justice/courts-system/courts/) . It hears appeals from the High Court in
civil cases, and appeals from the [ Circuit Criminal Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) , the [ Central Criminal Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) and the [ Special Criminal Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/special-criminal-court/) in criminal cases.

The Court of Appeal is not a court of local or limited jurisdiction. This
means that it is not restricted to hearing cases from certain geographical
areas and there is no limit to the amount of monetary damages it can award.

Established in 2014 under the [ Court of Appeal Act 2014
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0018/index.html) , the Court
of Appeal replaced the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Courts-Martial Appeal
Court, which were abolished. As a result, the only appeals that go to the [
Supreme Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/) are those which
raise issues of major public importance or where the interests of justice
require such an appeal. For more, see ‘Appealing Court of Appeal decisions’
below.
