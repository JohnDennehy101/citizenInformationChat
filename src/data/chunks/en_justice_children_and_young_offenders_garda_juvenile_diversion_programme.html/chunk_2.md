##  Introduction

The Garda Youth Diversion Programme aims to prevent young offenders and
children involved in anti-social behaviour in Ireland from committing further
offences and entering into the adult criminal justice system.

The programme helps young people under 18 years of age.

While the age of criminal responsibility for children is 12 years of age, the
programme can involve children as young as 10 years old.

When a young person comes to the notice of the Garda√≠ because of their
behaviour, they may be dealt with through the Diversion Programme.

The details of the Youth Diversion Programme are found in [ Part 4 of the
Children Act 2001
