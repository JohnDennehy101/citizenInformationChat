###  What is JLO supervision?

Supervision normally involves the JLO closely monitoring the childâ€™s behaviour
in relation to the caution.

The young person may have to agree to:

  * Engage in certain activities 
  * Attend a local youth project, or 
  * Report on particular occasions to the JLO or another Garda.
