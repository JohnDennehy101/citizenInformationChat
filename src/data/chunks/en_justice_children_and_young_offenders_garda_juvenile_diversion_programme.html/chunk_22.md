###  What is a Diversion Programme conference?

The Diversion Programme can hold a meeting (or conference) to discuss the
welfare of a child admitted to the programme.

The conference may:

  * Mediate between the child and the victim (where appropriate) in line with the terms of the programme. 
  * Formulate an action plan for the child. 

Conferences must also uphold the concerns of the victim and consider their
interests.

The conference aims to:

  * Establish why the child became involved in the behaviour that gave rise to their admission to the programme 
  * Discuss how the parents, guardians, family members, relatives or other people can prevent the child from becoming involved in such behaviour 
  * Review the childâ€™s behaviour since their admission to the programme, where appropriate 

These conferences are established in law under [ Section 29 of the Children
Act 2001 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/sec0029.html)
