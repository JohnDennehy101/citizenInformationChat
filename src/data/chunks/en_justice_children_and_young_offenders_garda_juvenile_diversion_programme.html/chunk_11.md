###  Factors considered for admission to a diversion programme

In making their decision, the Director may consider:

  * The nature of the offence 
  * The views of the victim 
  * The interests of society 
  * The views of the arresting Garda 
  * The views of the JLO 
  * The attitude and views of the young person who offended 
  * The views of the young person’s parents or guardians 
  * Whether an apology has been made 
  * Whether or not something can be done to repair any harm caused 
  * The child’s previous involvement in the programme 

If a child is not admitted to the programme, they may be prosecuted or an [
anti-social behaviour order ](/en/justice/children-and-young-offenders/anti-
social-behaviour-by-children/) may be sought.
