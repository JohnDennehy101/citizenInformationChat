###  **Who decides on the level of supervision?**

The level of supervision is normally decided by the JLO. When deciding the
level of supervision, they consider the following matters:

  * Seriousness of the childâ€™s behaviour 
  * Level of support given to, and the level of control of, the child by the parents or guardians 
  * Likelihood of the child committing further offences or anti-social behaviour 
  * Directions from the Director regarding the appropriate level of supervision 

Generally, a child who gets an informal caution is not placed under the
supervision of a JLO. However, in exceptional circumstances, a young person
given an informal caution can be placed under the supervision of a JLO for 6
months.
