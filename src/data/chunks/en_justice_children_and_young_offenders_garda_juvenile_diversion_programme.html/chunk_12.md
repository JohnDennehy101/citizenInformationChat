###  After a child is admitted to the programme

**Written notice**

The Director directs a JLO to give notice in writing to the parents or
guardians of a child who is admitted to the programme. This notice includes:

  * The type of criminal or anti-social behaviour the child will be cautioned for 
  * If the caution will be formal or informal. 

The parents or guardians are obliged to attend the cautioning process.

The Director of the Garda Youth Diversion Programme ensures the written notice
is in language the parents or guardians can understand. The notice may be
given in the first language of the parents or guardians if appropriate.

The notice will also be available in Irish for children from Gaeltacht areas
or those whose first language is Irish.
