##  Introduction

Before you go on a trip, make sure to do a few essential things. First, check
the rules and requirements for the country you are visiting. You might need a
visa, or your passport may need renewing. You should think about getting
travel insurance in case something goes wrong. If you plan to drive, ensure
your driverâ€™s license is valid. While you're away, it's good to know where the
nearest Irish Embassy or Consulate is, just in case you need help.
