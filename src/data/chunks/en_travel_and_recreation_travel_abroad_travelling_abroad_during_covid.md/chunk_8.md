##  Driving abroad

If you plan to drive while abroad, make sure that your Irish [ driving licence
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/full-driving-licence/)
is valid and that you bring it with you.

Some countries outside the European Economic Area (the member states of the
European Union, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) may require you to hold an
[ International Driving Permit (IDP) ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/international-driving-permit/) and your
Irish driving licence.

See the [ IDP application form (pdf) ](https://www.theaa.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2023/11/AA_IDP-Application202310-1.pdf) for a full list of
countries that recognise the permit.

Always make sure you are properly insured for driving while overseas.
