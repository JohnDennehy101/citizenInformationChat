##  Returning to work after being unemployed

If you are returning to work after a long break, there are a number of options
to consider and steps you should take before you start work. This page
explains what will happen to your income supports, medical card, rent
supplement and how to pay PRSI and tax.

You may need help with finding a job or you may be interested in [ further
training before starting work ](/en/education/further-education-and-training/)
. Your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office can advise you about job
opportunities - see 'more information' below.

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) is responsible for providing
employment services and guidance to jobseekers as well as income support.

You can use the [ benefit of work estimator
](https://www.mywelfare.ie/BenefitOfWorkDAestimator) from the DSP to help you
assess the financial consequences of taking up full-time work. The estimator
works out the total amount you would receive on taking up full-time work
(including any Working Family Payment) and compares this to what you are
getting in jobseeker payments (including Rent Supplement).
