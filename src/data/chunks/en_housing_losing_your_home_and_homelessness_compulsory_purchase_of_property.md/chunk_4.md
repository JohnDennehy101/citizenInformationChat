##  Can I get compensation?

If your house and land are compulsorily purchased, you can get compensation.
The level of compensation should:

  * Leave you in the same position financially as you were before the compulsory purchase, or as close as possible to this 
  * Be based on the market value of your property 
  * Reflect the value of the land that is purchased and any reduction in the value of any land you keep that came about because of the CPO 

The Society of Chartered Surveyors has a [ client guide to CPOs and
compensation. ](https://scsi.ie/a-clear-guide-to-compulsory-purchase-orders-
