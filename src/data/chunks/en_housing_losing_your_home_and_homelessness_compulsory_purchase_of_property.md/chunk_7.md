###  What is the process for purchasing these sites?

The local authority must advertise the details of any proposed compulsory
purchase in the local newspaper. They must also send a notice to the owner or
occupier of the land, giving them information about how and where to object to
the proposed purchase.

For dangerous places, a notice must also be posted on or near the land, giving
details of the local authority's intentions to compulsory purchase the place.

If someone makes an objection, the local authority cannot buy the land without
the consent of [ An Bord Pleanála ](/en/housing/planning-permission/an-bord-
pleanala/) .

If An Bord Pleanála approves the compulsory purchase and the local authority
has dealt with any objections, the local authority can buy the land, using a [
vesting order ](https://www.tailte.ie/registration/guidance-and-legal-
practices/legal-practices/practice-directions/local-authority-vesting-orders/)
.
