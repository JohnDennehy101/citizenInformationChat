##  What is a compulsory purchase order?

Certain statutory bodies can take land or property without the owner's
consent. A compulsory purchase order (CPO) is the legal function they use to
do this.

Compulsory purchase usually happens to allow a public infrastructure project
to go ahead for the common good. CPOs are most often used for road improvement
schemes and urban development schemes, such as the [ LUAS ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/public-transport/luas/) project in Dublin.
