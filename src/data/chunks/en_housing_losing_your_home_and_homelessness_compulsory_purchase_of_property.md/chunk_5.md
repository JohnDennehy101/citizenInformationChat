##  How long will the compulsory purchase process take?

The CPO process can take about 18 months. But, it can be shorter or longer
than this. There are a number of factors which can affect this timeframe,
including:

  * The size of the CPO 
  * If there are objections 
  * If there is an oral hearing 
  * If there is a judicial review
