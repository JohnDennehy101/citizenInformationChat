###  **Approved housing bodies for older people**

[ Approved housing bodies (AHBs)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) provide similar housing to local
authorities, with some dedicated homes for older people.

They have some discretion about who they will give housing to, but most of
their housing is assigned in consultation with the local authority.
