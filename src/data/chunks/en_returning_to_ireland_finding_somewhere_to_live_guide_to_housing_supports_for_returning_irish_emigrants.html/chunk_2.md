##  Introduction

As an Irish citizen, you have the right to live and work in Ireland,
regardless of how many years you have lived abroad.

If you return home to Ireland and have difficulty paying rent or buying
suitable accommodation, you may qualify for social housing or financial
support from the State.

Depending on your age and circumstances, you may be eligible for housing
supports for older people.
