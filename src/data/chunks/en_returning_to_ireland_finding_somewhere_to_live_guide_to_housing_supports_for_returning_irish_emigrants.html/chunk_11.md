###  **Help with buying a home**

If you plan to buy a property when you return to Ireland, you can read about [
Taking out a mortgage ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-
a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/taking-out-a-mortgage/) .

You can also check if you qualify for the [ Help to Buy Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/help-to-buy-scheme) . This scheme helps first-time buyers
purchase a newly built house or apartment. You can also get it for once-off
self-build homes. However, **you cannot get the Help to Buy Scheme if you
owned a home abroad** .

Other schemes you may be interested in are the [ First Home Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/first-home-scheme/) and  
[ Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/local-authority-affordable-purchase-scheme/) . These are 'shared
equity' schemes, where the State or the local authority takes a stake in your
home to help you buy it.
