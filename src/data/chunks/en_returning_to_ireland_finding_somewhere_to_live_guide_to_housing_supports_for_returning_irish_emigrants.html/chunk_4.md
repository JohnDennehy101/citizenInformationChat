###  **Local connection**

To apply for social housing, download an application form from [ your local
authority's ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/)
website.

You can only apply to one local authority at a time, and you must choose an
area with which you have a ‘local connection’. This means that you (or a
member of your household):

  * Lived in the area at any time for a continuous period of 5 years 
  * Worked in the area (or within a 15km radius) 
  * Are in full-time education in the area 
  * Have an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment and are attending a medical service in the area in relation to that impairment 
  * Have a relative who has been living in the area for at least 2 years 

As you are returning to Ireland from abroad, it might be difficult to meet the
‘local connection’ requirement. Try to give as much evidence as possible, such
as letters from friends, membership of local clubs, or proof of attending a
local college.

In some cases, **the local authority can waive the local connection
requirement** .
