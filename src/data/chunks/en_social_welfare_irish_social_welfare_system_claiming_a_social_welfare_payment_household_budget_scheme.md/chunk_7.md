###  How can I stop a deduction?

To cancel a deduction you must give 2 weeks written notice to An Post (see
address below). Remember to give your name, address, [ PPS number
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-
number/) and details of the deductions you want to cancel, including the
account number. If you want to cancel the deductions paid to a housing body,
you must include a letter of authorisation from the housing body.
