##  Introduction

The Household Budget Scheme is a scheme that helps people getting certain
social welfare payments to spread the cost of some household bills over the
year. Under this scheme, a fixed amount is deducted from your social welfare
payment each week.

The scheme is operated by An Post and in order to qualify, you must be getting
a specified social welfare payment and your payment **must be paid** through
your local post office. The Household Budget Scheme is free of charge.
