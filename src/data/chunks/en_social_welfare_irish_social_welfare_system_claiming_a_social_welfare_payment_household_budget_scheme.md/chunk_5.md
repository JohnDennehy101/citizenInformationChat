##  How much can I deduct?

You can choose to cover the full amount of the bill. However, you cannot have
more than 25% of your total weekly social welfare payment deducted under this
scheme. A [ minimum amount must be deducted each week for each bill to be paid
under the Household Budget Scheme

**Rent to a local authority:** The amount deducted per week will be equal to
your weekly rent payment agreed with your housing provider as long as the
total payment is not greater than 25% of your weekly flat payment.

**Utilities:** The minimum weekly payment to any utility is â‚¬5.

The deduction from your payment will be passed on to pay your bill within 4
days of you getting your payment at the post office. However if 25% of your
social welfare payment is not enough to meet all your deductions in a
particular week the local authority (housing body) deduction will be made
first.
