###  Engage with local Intreo and sign a quarterly declaration

You must sign a declaration every quarter of a year to say that you still
qualify for the payment. You also must attend appointments at your local
Intreo when asked, and your rate of payment could be reduced if you refuse to
take part in recommended courses, employment, and schemes.
