###  Not cohabiting

You cannot get JST if you are living with your spouse, civil partner, or
cohabitant. This applies to opposite sex and same sex relationships. It also
applies if the person is not the parent of the child.

If you are married and have separated, you cannot get JST until you have been
separated for 3 months.

The Department of Social Protection has detailed guidance on [ what
cohabitation means ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d258d8-cohabitation/)
for social welfare payments.
