###  **Part-time options**

If you donâ€™t want to study full-time, there are other options available
including:

  * Part-time courses 
  * Modular programmes 
  * Distance learning, online courses and hybrid courses 

If you choose to study on a part-time or modular basis, you can spread your
studies over a number of years. This gives you the opportunity to organise
your time and to study when it is most convenient for you.

It will take longer to complete than a full-time course, but it has the
advantage that it allows you to work at your own pace, gradually building
credits towards your qualification. Credits measure the amount of work needed
to complete a course, and credits earned represent the progress you have made
towards getting a degree.
