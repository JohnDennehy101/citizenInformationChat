##  College entry requirements for mature students

Generally, you will need to have completed your Leaving Certificate to attend
third level education. However, if you are applying for a place as a mature
student, you will not be asked to meet the usual entry requirements.

Different courses have different entry procedures. Usually, colleges will
consider your:

  * Educational background 
  * Work history 
  * Community involvement 
  * Other achievements and interests 

This system is known as the Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning
(APEL) or [ Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)
](https://www.qualifax.ie/resources/recognition-of-prior-learning) . Course
providers can use APEL or RPL to let you enter a course or give you exemptions
from parts of a course based on your previous learning and experience.

It is useful to find out whether the college of your choice uses the APEL or
RPL system before you apply.

You can find more information about [ mature student entry requirements for
full-time undergraduate courses ](https://www.qualifax.ie/resources/adult-
learners) on the Qualifax website.

In some cases, you may be asked to take an entrance exam.
