###  Making a claim for a delay

You can claim 25% of the ticket price if you get to your final destination at
least:

  * 1 hour late, on a journey of up to 4 hours 
  * 2 hours late, on a journey of between 4 and 8 hours 
  * 3 hours late, on a journey of between 8 and 24 hours 
  * 6 hours late, on a journey of more than 24 hours 

If the delay is more than double the times listed above, you can claim 50% of
the ticket price. The company must pay this compensation within 1 month of
getting your claim.
