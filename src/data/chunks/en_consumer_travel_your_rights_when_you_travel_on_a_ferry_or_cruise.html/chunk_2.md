##  What are my rights when travelling by ferry or cruise?

You have passenger rights when you travel on most ferries and cruise ships in
the EU.

These are sometimes called _maritime passenger rights_ and cover delays,
cancellations, lost luggage and injury.

_Travel operators_ must:

  * Give you information about your rights and what assistance you are entitled to 
  * Make sure you and other passengers are treated fairly and equally 
  * Resolve issues caused by delays or cancellations 

Travel operators include transport companies (which run ferries and cruise
ships) and companies that run terminals such as ferry ports.
