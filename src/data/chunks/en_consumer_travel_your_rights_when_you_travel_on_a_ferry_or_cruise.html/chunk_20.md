##  Making a complaint

If you are not satisfied with how a travel company has handled an issue, you
should complain to them directly.

Contact the travel company to find out exactly how to make a complaint to
them.

Follow their instructions to make a complaint. For ferries and cruise ships,
you must make the complaint within 2 months of the incident. You must receive
a reply within 1 month, telling you whether the complaint has been accepted or
rejected or is still being considered.

If you are not satisfied with the response, you can take your complaint to the
[ National Transport Authority (NTA) ](https://www.nationaltransport.ie/) .
