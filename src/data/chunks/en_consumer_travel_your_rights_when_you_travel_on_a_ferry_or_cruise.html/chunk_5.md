###  **Information**

The transport or terminal company must tell you about the situation within 30
minutes of the time the ship was due to leave. As soon as they know, they must
also tell you:

  * What time the ship is now due to leave and arrive 
  * Alternative connections you can get if you miss a connecting transport service because of the delay or cancellation
