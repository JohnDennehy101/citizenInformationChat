##  Getting a gas connection

If you are building a home, or moving into a home that has never been
connected to the gas network, you must contact GNI to be connected. As the gas
network is not available in all parts of the country, you must first check if
gas is available in your area. You can do this by using GNIâ€™s [ Gas Network
Map ](https://www.gasnetworks.ie/home/get-connected/connect-now/) .

If gas is available, you can either:

  * Contact GNI to apply and pay for connection works to be carried out 
  * Contact a gas supplier to sign up to a service and they can organise connection with GNI for you 

GNI will install the external gas pipes and meter you need to set up the
connection. The internal work on the house, including gas pipes and connection
to appliances, must be completed by a [ Registered Gas Installer (RGI)
](http://www.rgii.ie/) . The RGI must give you a conformance certificate when
the internal work has been completed.

If you want to disconnect from the gas supply because of building or
renovation work, you must contact GNI for advice.

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has more information about [
