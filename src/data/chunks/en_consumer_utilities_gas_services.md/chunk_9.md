##  How to complain

If you have a problem, first contact either:

  * Your gas supplier for issues such as billing, account problems, marketing or advertising, or changing supplier 
  * GNI for problems such as a faulty meter, connection costs, emergencies, outages, or connection delays 

If you cannot sort out the problem informally, you can complain in writing to
either your supplier or the network provider.

If you are not happy with the response from your provider, you can:

  * Contact the Commission for Regulation of Utilities for information and advice, and if necessary, to use its [ complaint resolution service ](https://www.cru.ie/home/complaint-form/energy/log-complaint-cru/)
  * Take a claim against the company through the courts using the [ Small Claims Procedure ](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/)
