###  1\. Consequential disqualification

Consequential disqualification arises as a matter of course if you are
convicted of an offence for which the law mandates automatic disqualification.
The court does not have discretion in relation to convictions in this
category.

For example, penalties on conviction for dangerous driving causing death are
the same as penalties for manslaughter and also carry a mandatory
disqualification from driving for a minimum of 4 years. Similarly, since
October 2011, all convictions in the District Court for drink driving offences
carry a mandatory disqualification from driving for a minimum of 6 months.

If a consequential disqualification order is made by a court, the driver
generally has 10 days to surrender their licence. If, however, the
disqualification follows from having too many penalty points, the driver has
14 days to surrender their licence.
