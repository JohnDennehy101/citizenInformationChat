##  What happens if I commit a driving offence abroad?

Penalty points and endorsements on driving licences received in other
countries (including EU/EEA member states) do not transfer between states.
This means that if you got penalty points abroad or already have endorsements
on your driving licence before coming to Ireland, these penalty points or
endorsements will not transfer over to an Irish driving licence.

If, however, you have been disqualified from driving in another country and
this was **in addition to a prison sentence** for driving offences it may not
be possible for you to [ exchange your full foreign driving licence
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/exchanging-foreign-
driving-permit/) for a full driving licence here in Ireland.

The situation is different between Ireland and the UK (including Northern
Ireland) for [ driving disqualifications for specified offences
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/licensed-drivers/mutual-recognition-of-
disqualifications-ireland-and-uk) . This is provided for by [ Section 40 of
the Road Traffic Act 2016
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/21/section/40/enacted/en/html#sec40)
.

Under this agreement between Ireland and the UK, if you hold an Irish licence
and you are disqualified from driving for committing a serious offence in the
UK, you may also be disqualified from driving in Ireland.

The District Court can make an order to disqualify you from driving in Ireland
for the offence that was committed in the UK. The same rules apply if you are
driving in Ireland on an UK licence, although the UK authorities can
disqualify you without taking separate court action.
