##  Operation of disqualification orders

In general, there are 2 ways you can be disqualified from driving.

Either:

  * You get too many penalty points (endorsements) on your licence or learner permit within a set period of time; or 
  * You are convicted of a driving offence for which the penalty imposed requires you to be disqualified from driving
