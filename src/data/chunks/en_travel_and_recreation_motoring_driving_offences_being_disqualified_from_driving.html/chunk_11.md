###  3\. Special Disqualification

The District Court has the discretion to disqualify a driver as a consequence
of an application made to it by a member of An Garda Síochána submitting that
a person is unfit to driver a motor vehicle by reason of:

  * Physical disease; 
  * Physical or mental disability; or 
  * Incompetence 

Special disqualification orders occur infrequently, with only a handful of
such cases being taken each year. If a special disqualification order is made
by a court, the driver generally has 14 days to surrender their licence or
make an appeal to the Circuit Court.
