###  Surrendering your licence

Depending on the type of disqualification order made by the court (for more,
see 'Types of disqualification orders'), you will be required to surrender
your licence to the [ National Driver Licence Service (NDLS)
](https://www.ndls.ie/about-us.html) within 10 or 14 days of the order
commencing.

Upon receiving your licence, the NDLS updates your driver record to reflect
the fact that your licence has been received. If it is not received, no
amendment is made. Upon being disqualified from driving, your record will also
be updated on the [ National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF)
](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/1ba443-motor-taxvehicle-
registration/) . The NDLS retain your driving licence until the expiration of
your period of disqualification, or until the removal of your disqualification
order, and return it to you.

It is an offence not to surrender your licence, which carries a maximum fine
of €1,000 on first conviction and up to €2,000 on a second or further
conviction.

The penalty for driving while disqualified is a fine of up to €5,000 and/or a
prison term of 6 months.
