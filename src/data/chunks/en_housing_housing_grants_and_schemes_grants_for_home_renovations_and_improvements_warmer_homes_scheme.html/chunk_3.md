##  What energy upgrades are available?

The scheme covers these home energy upgrades:

  * Attic insulation 
  * Wall insulation - including cavity wall, internal wall and external wall insulation 
  * Draught-proofing 
  * Lagging jackets 
  * Energy efficient lighting 
  * Energy advice 

New central heating systems and replacement windows are also occasionally
covered by the scheme. Your windows will only be replaced if your walls are
being insulated at the same time and the existing windows are single-glazed
windows. The SEAI decides if replacement windows are needed on a case by case
basis.
