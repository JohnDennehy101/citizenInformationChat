##  Iâ€™ve been refused a payment because of the HRC

If you are refused a payment because of the HRC and you believe it is
incorrect, you can send additional evidence to the Department and ask them to
review their decision.

You can also write to the [ Social Welfare Appeals Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/031734-the-social-welfare-appeals-office/)
to appeal the decision. You must appeal within 21 days of getting the
decision. There is no charge for making an appeal.
