##  How do I satisfy the HRC?

You must complete the [ HRC1 form (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/27484/305a54e8a062459ab0b394e8f2031ce9.pdf) , and send
it with your application form for the payment, to the relevant authority (for
example, to the Child Benefit Section in the Department of Social Protection).

The HRC form will ask you for information about your life abroad and in
Ireland, including your address(es), employment history, children and other
family members.
