###  How long do the requirements to notify the Garda√≠ last for?

It depends on the length of sentence you receive from the court. The longer
the sentence, the longer the requirements last. The following is a guide to
the length of time the requirements last:

  * 12 years: if you were imprisoned for life 
  * 7 years: if you were imprisoned more than 10 years (but not imprisonment for life) 
  * 5 years: if you were imprisoned for more than 5 years (but not more than 10 years) 
  * 3 years: if you were imprisoned for more than one year (but not more than 5 years) 
  * 1 year: if your imprisonment is suspended by the court 

If you are not given a sentence of imprisonment of one year or more, you are
not subject to the notification requirements.
