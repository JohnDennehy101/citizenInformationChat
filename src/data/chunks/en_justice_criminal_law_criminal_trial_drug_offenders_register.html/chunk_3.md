##  When do I have to notify the Gardaí?

If you are convicted of a drug trafficking offence you are required to notify
the Gardaí of certain information about yourself within 7 days. When you
receive a term of imprisonment following a drug conviction, your duty to
notify the Gardaí doesn’t begin until after you are released from prison. You
then have 7 days from the date of release to notify the Gardaí. The Governor
of the prison is obliged to notify the Gardaí at least 10 days before your
release that you are going to be released.
