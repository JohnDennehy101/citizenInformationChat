####  Account fees

Check what fees are charged. There may be maintenance fees that are charged
regularly to keep the account open. Maintenance fees may include certain
types, or a certain number, of transactions each month.

There may also be fees for specific services or transactions, for example:

  * ATM withdrawal fees 
  * Debit card purchase fees (charged when you use your debit card to pay for goods in a shop or get cash back) 
  * Credit transfers 
  * Direct debit set up or cancellation 
  * Standing order setup, amendment or cancellation 
  * Overdraft fees 
  * Non-euro transaction fees (charges for using your debit card in countries outside of the Eurozone) 
  * Lost card fees 
  * Duplicate statement fees 
  * Charges for refused direct debits and standing orders 

Before you open your account, the bank should give you a fee information
document. This document shows the most important services offered on the
account and any related fees you may have to pay.

Your bank must also give you a statement of fees at least once a year. This
statement explains the fees incurred on your bank account and gives
information on the interest rates applied to your account.
