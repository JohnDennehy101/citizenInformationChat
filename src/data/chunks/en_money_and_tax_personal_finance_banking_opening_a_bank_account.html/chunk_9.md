##  How to open a bank account

To open a bank account you usually apply in a branch or online.

Before you open a bank account, you have to provide [ proof of your identity
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/banking/financial-institutions-and-
identification/) and verify your address. If you are opening a joint account,
you both need to fill in the application and show 2 sets of documents for
proof of identity and proof of address.

If you apply online, you still need to provide your documents. Most banks need
hard-copy forms of documentation to be submitted in-branch or by post after
you have completed your online application.
