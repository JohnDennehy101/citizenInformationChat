##  How to choose a bank account

Before opening a bank account, you should think about how you use your account
and what features you want:

  * **Review your banking habits** . Check back over your records and count how many times you make each of the following transactions: cash withdrawals, bill payments, debit card purchases, contactless payments, money transfers, in-branch cashier transactions and non-EU transactions. 
  * **Know how you make your transactions** . Check whether you make most banking transactions using ATMs, online or in-branch. 
  * **Decide how you want to deal with your bank** . You might like dealing with a person in a branch, so choosing a bank you can easily get to will be an important factor. If you prefer the convenience of internet and mobile banking, you should make sure you are happy with the online and mobile services of your chosen bank. 

Make sure you understand all the terms, conditions and fees of the account
before you sign up. You can check the CCPCâ€™s [ jargon buster

not understand.
