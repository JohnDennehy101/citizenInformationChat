###  Building inspections

[ ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1981/act/30/enacted/en/html) Members of
the fire service can inspect any building within their jurisdiction. They may
ask for any of the following details:

  * The number of employees or occupants in the building 
  * The purpose of any room or area in the building 
  * The materials used in the building's construction 
  * Any official documents relating to the building's safety 
  * Drawings or plans of the building 

If a fire inspector is not satisfied with the safety of a building, they can
make an application to the [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-
court/) requesting the moderation or making safe of the building. They can
also ask for construction to be halted until the issue is resolved.

If the High Court grants the order, the property owners must make the
specified alterations.

It is an offence to obstruct, impede or refuse entry to a fire inspector.
