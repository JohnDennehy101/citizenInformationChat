###  Petrol storage

Fire services issue licences to those in possession of large amounts of petrol
or dangerous substances. Applicants must submit plans and maps of their site,
and any adjoining sites, to their local authority. Before issuing a licence,
fire services will ensure that all dangerous substances are stored safely and
at a suitable distance from nearby buildings. The Health and Safety Authority
website has more information on the rules around [ petrol storage and licences
