##  Rates for Youthreach

Courses are free. Trainees aged over 16 get a weekly allowance. You will get a
travel allowance if you have to travel 5 km or more to the centre. You may
also qualify for [ free childcare ](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/national-childcare-scheme/) and a meal allowance - you should check
with the centre.

From January 2023, weekly allowances are as follows:

Trainee(s)  |  maximum payment per week   
---|---  
16 - 17 years  |  €45   
18 years and over  |  €232.00 (with some exceptions)   
  
If you were getting a reduced age-related Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) before
starting Youthreach any means that were deducted from your JA will also be
deducted from your training allowance. This also applies to people getting a
reduced age-related basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA).

If you are over 18 years of age and you are currently getting a social welfare
payment of more than €232, you will continue to get the higher amount while
you are on Youthreach as long as you are eligible.

You can take up part-time work while on Youthreach without it affecting your
training allowance.
