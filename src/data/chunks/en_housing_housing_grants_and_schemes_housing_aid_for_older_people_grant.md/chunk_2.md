##  Introduction

The [ Housing Aid for Older People Grant
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/6636c-housing-adaptation-grants-for-older-
people-and-people-with-a-disability/#housing-aid-for-older-people-grant) is
for essential repairs to improve the condition of an older person's home so
they can continue to live there. It is aimed at people aged 66 and older, who
are living in poor housing conditions. However, in cases of genuine hardship
the local authority may help people under the age of 66.

If you have a disability and your home needs to be adapted to make it more
accessible, the [ Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability
](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-
and-people-with-disabilities/housing-adaptation-grant-for-people-with-
disability/) or the [ Mobility Aids Grant Scheme ](/en/housing/housing-grants-
and-schemes/housing-supports-for-older-people-and-people-with-
disabilities/mobility-aids-grant-scheme/) may be more suitable for you. These
grants are all administered by local authorities.
