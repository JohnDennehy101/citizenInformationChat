###  Periodic tenancy

A _periodic_ tenancy agreement does not specify a fixed length of time. The
period of the tenancy may be weekly or monthly, depending on how often the
rent is due. Periodic tenancy agreements may or may not be in writing.

Your landlord can end the tenancy at any time during the first 6 months of the
tenancy without having to give a reason, but, in general, you will get
security of tenure after 6 months – see ‘Part 4 tenancy’ below. You must
always get a valid written notice of termination and there are rules about how
much notice you must be given, depending on the length of the tenancy (with
some exceptions). Read more in our page [ If your landlord wants you to leave
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-responsibilities/if-your-
landlord-wants-you-to-leave/) .

As a tenant, you can end the periodic tenancy at any time. You do not have to
give a reason. Again, there are rules about notice periods and what
constitutes a valid notice of termination – see ‘Ending your tenancy’ below.
