###  Exceptions to security of tenure rights

If you are renting a flat or apartment that was originally part of the
landlord's main house, your landlord can choose to opt out of the Part 4
provisions on security of tenure. Read more in our page on [ Sharing
accommodation with your landlord ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
and-responsibilities/sharing-accommodation-with-your-landlord/) .

Tenants of certain properties let by housing associations do not get Part 4
rights. For example, people living in transitional housing. Transitional
housing is temporary supported accommodation that helps people move from
homelessness to independent living in permanent accommodation.

Part 4 rights do not apply to tenants in [ student-specific accommodation
](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-compliance/registrations/student-
specific-accommodation) even though other parts of residential tenancies
legislation covers these tenancies.
