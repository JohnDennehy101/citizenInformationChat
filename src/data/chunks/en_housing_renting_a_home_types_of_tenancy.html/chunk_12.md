###  Fixed-term tenancy

A _fixed-term tenancy_ is an agreement that covers a specific amount of time.
It is generally (but not always) set down in a written contract, called a
lease. It may be for any period, but can range from as little as 6 months up
to a year or more. It is important to note the following points about a fixed-
term tenancy:

  * Your landlord cannot end the tenancy before the end of the fixed term unless you have breached your obligations 
  * In general, you cannot end the tenancy before the end of the term unless: 
    * The landlord has breached their obligations 
    * You are exercising a break clause 
    * You have got [ someone to replace you ](https://threshold.ie/faq/ending-your-tenancy/#:~:text=Assignment%20is%20where%20you%20find,any%20responsibilities%20under%20the%20tenancy)
    * You and the landlord both agree to end it 
  * If a private landlord refuses to consent to an [ assignment or sub-let ](https://www.rtb.ie/beginning-a-tenancy/types-of-tenancies-and-agreements/subletting-and-assignment) of the tenancy, you can terminate the tenancy under [ Section 186 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/print.html#sec186) This does not apply to tenants of approved housing bodies (housing associations), as they cannot assign or sublet their tenancy. 
  * In general, you get security of tenure after 6 months â€“ see above 
  * If you want to stay in the property after the end of the fixed term, you must notify the landlord at least a month before the term expires
