##  Make a complaint about mental health services

If you have a complaint about a mental health service, you should first
contact the service provider.

Each provider must have a clear complaints procedure under Article 31 of the [
Mental Health Act 2001 (Approved Centres) Regulations 2006
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/si/551/made/en/print) .

You can find more information on [ making a complaint about a health service
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/making-a-
complaint-about-the-health-service-executive/) .

The Mental Health Commission does not have the power to investigate
complaints. If you raise a concern with the MHC, it may direct you to the [
Inspector of Mental Health Services
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/mental-
health/inspector-of-mental-health-services/) if appropriate.

The Inspectorate logs all concerns about mental health services. These are
taken into account when making inspections.
