###  Investors and entrepreneurs

The [ Immigrant Investor Programme ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-
to-live-in-ireland/i-want-to-invest-in-ireland/) provided investment options
(with a minimum investment of €1 million) which allowed approved non-EEA
investors and their immediate family to enter Ireland on multi-entry visas and
to remain here for up to 5 years. **The Immigrant Investor Programme closed to
new applicants on 15 February 2023.** You can read [ 'frequently asked

for existing projects and investors.

The [ Start-up Entrepreneur Programme
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-live-in-ireland/i-want-to-invest-
in-ireland/) allows non-EEA participants with an innovative business proposal
and funding or financial backing of at least €50,000 to come and set up a
business in Ireland. This scheme does not apply to retail, catering, personal
services or similar businesses.

Successful applicants to both programmes will be granted a residence
permission for 2 years initially. You can read more about [ coming to set up a
