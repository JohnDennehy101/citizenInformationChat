####  What if I make a mistake?

If you make a mistake on your ballot paper, the returning officer may give you
another ballot paper. This is at the discretion of the returning officer; they
do not have to do this.

If you have already posted your ballot in the ballot box, the returning
officer cannot give you another ballot paper.
