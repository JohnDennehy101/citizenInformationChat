##  Spoiled votes

Ballot papers that cannot be counted are called spoiled votes. A ballot paper
may be spoiled if:

  * The ballot paper was left blank 
  * The ballot paper did not have the number ‘1’ next to any candidate 
  * The voter ticked or otherwise marked their preferred candidate or candidates, instead of numbering them 
  * The writing on the ballot paper could not be understood 
  * The ballot paper was not stamped by the presiding officer 
  * The voter wrote their name or identified themselves in some way 
  * The order of preference was not clear (for example, the voter wrote ‘3’ next to 2 different candidates) 
  * The voter deliberately spoiled their paper as a protest
