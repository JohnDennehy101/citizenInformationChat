##  Casting your vote

To cast your vote, you must:

  * Mark your ballot paper â€“ see 'how to mark your ballot paper' below 
  * Put your ballot paper into the ballot box 

Your vote is private.

You use the voting compartment at the polling station to vote in private.

The voting compartment will have a pencil for you to use. But you can bring
your own pen or pencil if you wish.
