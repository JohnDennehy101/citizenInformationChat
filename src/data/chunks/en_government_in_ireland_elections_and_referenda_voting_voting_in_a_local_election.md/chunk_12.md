##  Voters with disabilities

There are supports to enable people with disabilities to exercise their voting
rights.

You can:

  * Vote at another polling station if the local station is inaccessible 
  * Be helped to vote at the polling station by a companion or the presiding officer 
  * Vote using a ballot paper template if you have a visual impairment 
  * Vote by post 
  * Vote at a hospital, nursing home or similar institution if you live there 

At least one of these services is available to you if you have a physical
illness or disability, a visual impairment, or a reading or writing
disability.
