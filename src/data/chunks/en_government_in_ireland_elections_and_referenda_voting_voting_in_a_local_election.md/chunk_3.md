##  Where do I go to vote?

You vote in a polling station.

Polling stations are usually set up on the day of the election in a public
building, for example, a local school.

You can only vote in the polling station allocated to you.

Your polling station is named on your polling card, which you should get by
post.

If you did not get a polling card, you can find your polling station on your [
local authorityâ€™s website ](https://www.housing.gov.ie/local-
government/administration/local-authorities/local-authorities) .
