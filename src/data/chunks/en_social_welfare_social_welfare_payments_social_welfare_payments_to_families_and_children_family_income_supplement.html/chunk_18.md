###  **Assessable income**

Income that is taken into account for the Working Family Payment is called
'assessable income'.

It can include:

  * Your assessable earnings and your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant's assessable earnings. (Assessable earnings are gross pay minus tax, employee PRSI, Universal Social Charge and superannuation (including the Public Service Pension Levy and contributions to Personal Retirement Savings Accounts.) Income from working as a home help is assessed. 
  * Extra income you or your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant have from employment (such as pay for overtime, bonuses, allowances or commission) 
  * Any income you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant have from self-employment 
  * Income from occupational pensions 
  * Income you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may have including social welfare payments 
  * All family income from carer's payments ( [ Carer's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) or [ Carer's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) ) 
  * Rental income from the letting of property or land (the capital value is not assessed). The gross rental income is assessed and you cannot deduct mortgage payments or other expenses. Certain income from rent is not included in the means test – see ‘Income from rent’ below. 

Generally, all financial compensation is taken into account. However, certain
types of compensation are not assessed as income. You can find a [ list of
compensation payments not assessed ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/cash-income-not-included-in-the-
social-welfare-means-test/) as income.

The WFP income test does not assess capital. This includes property you own,
bank accounts and cars.
