####  **Maternity, adoptive, paternity or parentâ€™s leave**

When you are on [ maternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/maternity-leave/) , [ adoptive leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/adoptive-
leave/) , [ paternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/paternity-leave/) or [ parent's leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/parents-
leave/) , you are entitled to be treated in the same way as when you are at
work. This means that you can claim WFP if you meet the conditions of the WFP
and already have a child. A pregnant woman who has no other children does not
qualify for WFP until the birth of the baby.

You cannot continue to claim WFP if you:

  * Take additional unpaid maternity leave or adoptive leave 
  * Lose your job after returning to work 
  * Give up your job
