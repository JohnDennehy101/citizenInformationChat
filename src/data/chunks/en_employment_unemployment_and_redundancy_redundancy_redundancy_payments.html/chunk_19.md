##  How do I get my redundancy pay?

Your employer should pay the redundancy lump sum to you when your employment
ends. For example, this could be the last day of your notice period or on your
next pay day.

If your employer is paying you the redundancy lump sum, they do not have to
submit an online application form (previously called the RP50 form).

However, your employer should get proof that they paid your lump sum to you
and give you a copy of the proof of payment.

Your employer should also give you a written statement showing how any payment
has been worked out.
