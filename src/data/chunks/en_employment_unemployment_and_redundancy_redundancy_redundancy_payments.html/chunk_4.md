###  Top up payments

Your employer is not legally obliged to pay anything on top of the normal
statutory entitlements, that is, notice and statutory redundancy.

Your employer may want to give you a voluntary _top-up_ payment on the basis
that this is the industry norm.

You may have a contractual right to a top-up payment if this is stated in your
contract of employment, a collective agreement or from the custom and practice
of their employer.
