###  How to apply for the special redundancy payment

Your employer should [ apply for the payment on your behalf
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/7af78-covid-19-related-lay-off-payment-
scheme/#apply) to the Department of Social Protection.

If your employer does not apply on your behalf, contact the redundancy
payments section in the Department of Social Protection (you can find contact
details under ‘More information’ below).

The amount of the payment will be determined by the difference between:

  * The lump sum you would have been entitled to on redundancy if you had not been laid off due to COVID-19 
  * The amount you are actually entitled to on being made redundant
