###  Do the parties have to participate in ADR?

It is your own personal choice whether you want to use ADR to resolve a
dispute with a business. You do not have to use ADR and have the right to take
legal action instead. A court will usually require you to show that you have
tried to resolve the issue before taking legal action. You can find out more
about the [ small claims procedure ](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-
court/) and [ taking a civil case ](/en/justice/civil-law/taking-and-
appealing-a-civil-case/) .

In most cases, participation in ADR schemes is not mandatory for companies.
However, any business who commit to using, or are legally obliged to use an
ADR entity must point you to the name and website of the relevant ADR scheme.

There are some sectors where the trader must use a certain form of ADR. For
example, you have a legal right to bring a complaint about financial services
company to the [ Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) ](/en/money-
and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/making-a-pension-complaint/) . There are
trade associations that make it mandatory for their members to use a
particular ADR process, for example the [ Royal Institute of the Architects of
Ireland (RIAI) ](https://www.riai.ie/) .
