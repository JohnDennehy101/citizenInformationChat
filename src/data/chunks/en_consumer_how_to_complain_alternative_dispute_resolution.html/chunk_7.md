###  Are all ADR decisions legally binding?

This depends whether you use mediation or arbitration:

  * **Mediation:** The mediator can propose a solution but has no decision making power. You and the company you are in a dispute with will decide on the outcome, instead of having it imposed on you. 
  * **Arbitration:** Decisions of the arbitrator are final and _legally binding_ . This means that the decision puts a legal requirement on the retailer or you to act in a certain way. This could be to repay the money, to fix the item or to return the item, and so on. You or the company can only appeal the final decision under limited circumstances. If the outcome of this decision is legally binding on either party, you may not then be able to take the case to court.
