###  Trade associations and professional bodies

Trade associations or professional bodies represent members of a particular
industry or sector. Many have codes of practices that members have to follow.
Members who donâ€™t keep to the code rules can have their membership removed,
their ability to practice restricted or they can be fined. You can find out
