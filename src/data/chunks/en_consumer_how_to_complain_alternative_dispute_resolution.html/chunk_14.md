##  Using ADR to resolve cross-border disputes

Irish consumers can use ADR schemes to settle disputes with traders based
elsewhere in the EU.

You can [ submit a complaint ](https://www.eccireland.ie/submit-a-complaint/)
to the European Consumer Centre (ECC) Ireland, if you have tried to resolve
the issue with the business directly but have been unsuccessful.

If you cannot resolve a problem with a trader based in another EU country and
you bought online, you can use [ online dispute resolution ](/en/consumer/how-
to-complain/online-dispute-resolution/) .

You can find out more about your [ consumer rights in the EU
