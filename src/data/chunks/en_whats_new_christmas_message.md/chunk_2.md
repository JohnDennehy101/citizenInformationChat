#####  Site updates

As the Digital Content team gets ready to take a break over the Christmas
period, we want to wish you a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

We have posted the [ Christmas opening hours for the Citizens Information
Phone Services and Centres ](/en/whats-new/christmas-opening-hours-2023/) ,
and as always, you can find the information you need on [
citizensinformation.ie ](/en/) . The website will not be updated during this
period.
