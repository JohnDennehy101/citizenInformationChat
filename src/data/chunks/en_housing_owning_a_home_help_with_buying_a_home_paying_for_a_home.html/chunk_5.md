##  Mortgage lending limits

There are regulations that set limits on the amount banks are allowed to lend
you to buy a home. These regulations were brought in by the Central Bank in
2015 and have been amended a number of times.

The [ regulations
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/559/made/en/pdf) include loan-to-
income (LTI) and loan-to-value (LTV) limits. They also outline the flexibility
that lenders have to make exceptions to these limits. These are all described
in detail below.

These limits apply to most housing loans including equity release and top-up
on an existing mortgage. But, they do not apply to switcher mortgages, or to
the restructuring of mortgages in [ arrears or pre-arrears
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-arrears/overview-of-mortgage-debt/) .
