##  Mortgage approval

Commercial lenders (banks) offer a range of mortgage rates and products.
Before starting to look for a home, you should check with potential lenders to
get a statement of how much they are prepared to lend you. This is called
_approval in principle_ . Getting approval in principle will indicate what
price range you can consider when looking for somewhere to buy.

However, approval in principle doesnâ€™t mean that the lender has approved a
mortgage and agreed to lend you this amount. The official mortgage approval is
contained in a _letter of offer_ , which the lender will only issue when it is
fully satisfied with certain matters, including a valuation of the property
you are buying.
