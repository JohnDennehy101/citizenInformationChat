####  What is a first-time buyer?

You are a first-time buyer if you have never had a housing loan. ‘Fresh start’
applicants and certain other people are now also considered first-time buyers.
You may be a fresh start applicant if you previously owned a home but no
longer have a financial interest in it, because your relationship has ended or
you have gone through personal insolvency or bankruptcy.
