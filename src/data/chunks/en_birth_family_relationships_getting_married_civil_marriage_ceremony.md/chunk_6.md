###  Get a Marriage Registration Form (MRF)

Once you and your partner meet the 3-month notification requirements and you
have signed a _declaration_ that there is _no lawful impediment_ to you
getting married, the registrar will give you a Marriage Registration Form
(MRF). ‘ [ No lawful impediment
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a4a0c2-impediments-to-marriage-in-
ireland/) ’ means there is no legal reason why the marriage should not happen.

An MRF is like a marriage licence. It gives you permission to get married in
Ireland. The MRF is valid for 6 months from the date you intend to get
married.

You should give the MRF to the registrar who will be solemnising the marriage
before the marriage ceremony.
