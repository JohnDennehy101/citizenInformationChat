###  Signing the MRF after your marriage ceremony

Your marriage ceremony must be performed ( _solemnised_ ) by the registrar in
the presence of 2 witnesses. The witnesses must be aged 18 or over.

During the ceremony, you and your intended spouse must declare:

  1. That you do not know of any impediment to the marriage ( [ reason why you cannot get married ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a4a0c2-impediments-to-marriage-in-ireland/) ) 
  2. That you accept each other as husband/wife/spouse 

Immediately after the ceremony, the MRF must be signed by you, your spouse,
the 2 witnesses and the registrar.
