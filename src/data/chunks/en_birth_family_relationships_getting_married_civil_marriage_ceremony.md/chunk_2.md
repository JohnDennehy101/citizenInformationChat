##  What is a civil marriage ceremony?

A civil marriage ceremony is a _non-secular_ (non-religious), legally-binding
way to get married in Ireland. If you choose to have a civil ceremony, there
can be no mention of anything religious or spiritual in the ceremony.

In a civil ceremony, a _marriage registrar_ (a person who works for the State)
will _solemnise_ (perform) the marriage.

A _solemniser_ is the term used for people licensed by the State to conduct
weddings. The [ Register of Solemnisers
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/077ce8-register-of-solemnisers/) has
information and contact details for people who can perform marriage ceremonies
in Ireland. It is updated on a regular basis.

You can have a civil marriage ceremony in either a registry office, or in a
public venue that has been approved by the registry office. Civil marriage
ceremonies are available Monday to Friday with regional and local variances.
Ceremonies do not take place at weekends or on public or bank holidays.
