###  Tell the registrar about your intention to marry

You must give the registrar **at least 3 monthsâ€™ notice** of your intention to
get married. This is sometimes called _Notification of intention to marry_ .
You should book your appointment as far in advance as possible as appointments
fill up quickly.

Both of you must attend the marriage notification appointment.
