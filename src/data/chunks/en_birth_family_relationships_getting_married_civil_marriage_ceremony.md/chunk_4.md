###  Decide on a venue

You can have a civil ceremony in either a registry office, or a venue that is
approved by a registrar. You can [ book your civil ceremony online
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/getting-
married/book-appointment/) for some areas of the country.

You may have to pay an additional fee to have a registrar solemnise your
marriage in a venue that is not the registry office.

**Getting your wedding venue approved**

To get your wedding venue approved, [ contact the civil registration service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/contact-a-civil-
registration-service.html) in the district the venue is located in. You do not
have to live in the same area as the venue. The registrar may have to inspect
the venue.

The venue must be:

  * A building that is open to the public, **or**
  * A courtyard, garden, yard, field or piece of ground that is open to the public and is near to (and usually shared with) a building that is open to the public
