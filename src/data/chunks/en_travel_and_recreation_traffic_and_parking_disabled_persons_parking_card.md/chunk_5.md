###  How to use the parking card

You can use the card in any vehicle you are travelling in, either as a
passenger or driver. This means you can bring the card with you and display it
in the vehicle that you are driving or travelling in.

You can park in [ assigned disabled personâ€™s parking spaces ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/traffic-and-parking/parking-facilities-for-people-with-
disabilities/) . These spaces have the wheelchair symbol painted on the ground
or have a sign with a symbol displayed.
