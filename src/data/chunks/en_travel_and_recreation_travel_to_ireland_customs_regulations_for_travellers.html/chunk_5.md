###  Excise duties and VAT on goods

The sale of duty-free goods to those travelling within the EU was abolished in
1999. This means that you cannot buy goods that are free of excise duty and
VAT if you are travelling within the EU. Any goods you buy within the EU (
except for food, drink, and tobacco products for on-board consumption) are
subject to normal rates of excise duty and VAT. Duty-free sales are available
if you are travelling to destinations outside the EU.
