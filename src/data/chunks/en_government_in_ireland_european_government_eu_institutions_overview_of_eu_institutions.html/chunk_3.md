##  The European Parliament

The European Parliament is part of the legislative, or law making, process in
the EU.

Most proposed laws must be approved by the European Parliament **and** the
Council of the European Union before they can become law. You can read more
about how EU law is made in our document, ‘ [ EU law ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/eu-law/how-eu-law-works/) ’.

The Parliament has 705 seats and [ elections to fill these seats
](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-
referendums/european-elections/) are held in all member states every 5 years.
The European Parliament is the only directly elected body within the EU.

The Parliament elects its own president, along with 14 vice-presidents for a
term of 2.5 years. The president represents the Parliament to other EU
institutions.
