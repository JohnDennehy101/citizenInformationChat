##  Rate of Working Family Payment

The DSP will assess your household income in a means test. It compares your
total income to the WFP income limit for your family size.

If you earn less than the WFP income limit, you may get WFP.

Your WFP will be 60% of the difference between the WFP income limit for your
family size and your assessable income. The combined income of a couple (who
are married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting) is taken into account when
calculating assessable income.
