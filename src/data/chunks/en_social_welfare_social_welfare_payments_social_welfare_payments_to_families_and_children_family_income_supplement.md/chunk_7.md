###  Changes at work

**If your pay from work is reduced** , your WFP will stay the same. It will
not increase. However, when your WFP ends you can apply again with details of
your new lower income.

**If the number of hours you work each week falls** to under 38 hours a
fortnight, you are no longer entitled to WFP. You should tell the WFP section
of the Department of Social Protection (DSP) if this happens. See ‘Where to
apply’ below.

**If you move to a new job and continue to meet the rules for WFP (see
above)** , you can stay on your current WFP claim. You don’t have to tell the
WFP section of the DSP that you have moved to a new job. If you are getting
paid less in your new job, your WFP claim will not be reviewed to reflect the
decrease.

However, if you want your WFP to reflect your new income, you should:

  1. Contact the WFP Section to tell them that your circumstances have changed and that your current claim should be closed **and**
  2. Re-apply for WFP. 

**If you lose your job** , you are no longer entitled to WFP. You must tell
the WFP section of the DSP.
