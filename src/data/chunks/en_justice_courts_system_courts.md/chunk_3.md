##  What legal matters are heard in each court?

Each court has the power to make judgments over legal matters depending on how
serious the matter is. This is sometimes referred to as the courtâ€™s
jurisdiction.

The [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) is where
minor civil and criminal matters are dealt with initially. For example, if you
fail to pay a parking fine you may be brought to the District Court. You can
appeal the outcome of a case heard in the District Court to the Circuit Court.

The [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) is where more
serious civil and criminal matters are dealt with initially. For example, if
you are charged with a serious assault, you may be tried in the Circuit Court.
Many divorce and judicial separation proceedings are also heard in the Circuit
Court. You can appeal the outcome of a case heard in the Circuit Court to the
High Court.

The [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) is where the most
serious civil and criminal matters are heard initially. For example, the most
serious criminal offences, such as murder, are dealt with by the High Court.
The President of the High Court is in charge of the High Court. You can appeal
the outcome of a case heard in the High Court to the Court of Appeal or in
some instances directly to the Supreme Court.

The [ Court of Appeal ](/en/justice/courts-system/court-of-appeal/) hears
appeals from the High Court in civil cases and in criminal cases hears appeals
from:

  * The Circuit Criminal Court 
  * The Central Criminal Court 
  * The Special Criminal Court 

The [ Supreme Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/supreme-court/) is the final
court of appeal. The Chief Justice is in charge of the Supreme Court.
