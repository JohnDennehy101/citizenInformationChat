###  Special Criminal Court

Other courts can hear civil and criminal matters, the [ Special Criminal Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/special-criminal-court/) only deals with criminal
cases. This court was set-up to hear cases about paramilitary, subversive and
organised crimes, but much of its workload now involves organised crime cases.
This court sits with 3 judges and no jury.

The Director of Public Prosecutions sends cases to the Special Criminal Court
when it certifies that the ordinary Courts would not be able to achieve the
effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and
order.

The Irish Constitution also provides for the setting up of special courts
where the best interest of justice would not be served in a normal court, for
example, the [ Children Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/children-court/) and
the [ Drug Treatment Court ](https://www.courts.ie/drug-treatment-court) .
