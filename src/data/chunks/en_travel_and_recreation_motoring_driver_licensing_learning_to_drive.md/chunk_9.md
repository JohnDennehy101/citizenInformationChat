##  Step 3: Practice driving

Under the RSAâ€™s [ Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) scheme
](https://passthetest.ie/about-gdl/) , you must complete compulsory lessons
with an RSA Approved Driving Instructor (ADI) before you can take a test.

  * If you hold a learner permit for a car and light van, you must undergo [ Essential Driver Training (EDT) ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Driver-Training/Car-Training-EDT/)
  * If you hold a learner permit for a motorcycle, you must complete [ Initial Basic Training (IBT) ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Motorcyclists/Initial-basic-training-IBT-for-motorcyclists/)

However, these mandatory lessons alone will not prepare you for your test. [
RSA guidance (pdf) ](https://www.rsa.ie/docs/default-
source/services/s1.9-learner-driver-faqs/ldt_syllabus.pdf?sfvrsn=f6761d80_5)
is clear that you should practice driving as much as possible on all types of
roads and in all types of traffic situations with an ADI before arranging a
test. You can access [ details of ADIs ](http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-
Drivers/Finding-an-instructor/Find-an-instructor/) located across the country.

There is **no set cost** for EDT or IBT lessons and each driving instructor
determines their own price. You should shop around and compare the prices and
services offered by different ADIs to get the package that is best for you.
