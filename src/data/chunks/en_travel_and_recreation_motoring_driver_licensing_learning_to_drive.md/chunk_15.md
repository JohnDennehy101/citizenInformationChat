###  What does the test involve?

A driving test is designed to make sure that you:

  * Know the [ Rules of the Road ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/resources/rules-of-the-road)
  * Possess the knowledge and skill to drive competently in accordance with those rules 
  * Drive with proper regard for the safety and convenience of other road users 

The test lasts about 50 to 100 minutes, depending on traffic conditions and
the vehicle category. At the beginning of the test, you will be asked
technical questions about the rules of the road and the functionality of your
car. You may also be asked to point out different parts under the bonnet, such
as how to check oil levels, or which part is the engine.

You will then drive about 5 miles in a variety of road and traffic conditions
and will be examined on your practical skills.

The [ motorcycle test ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring-1/driving-
tests/driving-test#lb9fa2) is similar to the test for cars and work vehicles.
