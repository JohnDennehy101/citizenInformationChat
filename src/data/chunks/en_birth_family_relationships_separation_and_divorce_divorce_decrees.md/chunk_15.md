##  Mediation

If you decided to separate or divorce, [ mediation can help you to negotiate
your own terms of agreement ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/family-mediation-separating-couples/) . Mediation is a service that
allows a couple to make their own decisions, and it aims to ensure that
everyoneâ€™s needs and interests are met.

Mediation is not marriage counselling or a legal advice service.

If you are represented by a solicitor, your solicitor must explain and discuss
the option of mediation with you and provide a list of appropriate mediators.

If you choose to be represented by a solicitor, you must get a declaration
from the solicitor that you have been told about mediation as an alternative
to going to court. You must include this declaration with your court
application.

The [ Family Mediation Service ](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/our-
services/family-mediation/) is a free service provided by the [ Legal Aid
Board ](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/) to help couples in Ireland to
negotiate their own agreement.

The [ Mediators' Institute of Ireland ](https://www.themii.ie/) can provide a
list of private accredited mediators.
