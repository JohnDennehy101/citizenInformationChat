##  Do I need a solicitor?

You do not have to use a [ solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) or a
[ barrister ](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) when getting a divorce. If
you wish, you can represent yourself. However, there may be complex issues
that may make it very difficult to apply for a divorce without any
professional help.

If you and your spouse disagree about any issue, you are strongly advised to
see a family law solicitor. You and your spouse should not use the same
solicitor.
