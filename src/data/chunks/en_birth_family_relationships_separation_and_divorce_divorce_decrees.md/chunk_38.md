##  I got divorced in another country – is my divorce recognised in Ireland?

Divorces granted in most EU member states are generally automatically
recognised here without the need for a court application. However, if there is
a dispute, an application can be made to have the divorce recognised or not
recognised here.

Foreign divorces (including those granted in non-EU member states) will be
generally recognised in Ireland if either of the couple was living permanently
in the state granting the divorce at the date when the divorce proceedings
were issued. The foreign divorce will also be recognised in Ireland even if
the parties were not living permanently in the state grating the divorce and
are not living permanently in Ireland if the divorce is recognised in the
state or state where they now live. You must also comply with the laws of the
other country when obtaining your divorce.

If your divorce is not automatically recognised in Ireland, you can apply to
an Irish court to have the terms of the divorce recognised here.

The court’s decision will depend on a number of factors:

  * Where the divorce was granted 
  * When it was granted 
  * Whether either of the spouses lived in the jurisdiction granting the divorce, for how long, whether or not it was their normal residence, and whether they intended to stay there.
