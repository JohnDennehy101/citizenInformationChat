##  After you file your documents

After you and your spouse have submitted all of the necessary documents, you
will be given a date for a court hearing. This hearing will be held in
private. You may be allowed by the court to have someone accompany you.

divorce/) .

If the court decides you have grounds for a divorce, it will grant a decree of
divorce. This means the marriage is dissolved (officially ended) and you are
free to remarry.

Bona fide (genuine) members of the press can sometimes be in attendance at
court. They are not allowed to reveal personal details.

Most applications for divorce are made in the Circuit Court. However, it is
also possible to apply for a decree of divorce in the High Court. Applications
in the High Court are rare and limited to cases where there are very
substantial assets and complex ownership issues. The forms used will be
similar in content, but they may vary in name and number.
