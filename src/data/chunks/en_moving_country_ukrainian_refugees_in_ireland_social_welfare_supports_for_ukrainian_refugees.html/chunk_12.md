##  Work and social welfare payments

You can use the [ benefit of work estimator
](https://www.mywelfare.ie/benefitofworkjsestimator) to check if income from
work, including part time work, will affect your social welfare payment.

If you are getting a social welfare payment and you find work, you must tell
your [ local Intreo centre or DSP branch office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-
offices/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/en/service/40cf48-find-your-local-intreo-
office/) .
