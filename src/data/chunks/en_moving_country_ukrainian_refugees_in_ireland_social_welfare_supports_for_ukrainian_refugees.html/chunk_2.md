##  Income support

If you come to Ireland from Ukraine and you are covered by the [ EU Temporary
Protection Directive ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-
country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/temporary-
protection-directive/) , you can get income support from the Department of
Social Protection (DSP).

The type of income support you get depends on if you are in State-provided
accommodation or not – see ‘What social welfare payment can I get?’ below.

To get any Irish social welfare payment, you need a Personal Public Service
Number (PPS number).
