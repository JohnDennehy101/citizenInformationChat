###  **From 9 September 2024**

However, from 9 September 2024, if you are living in a [ Designated
Accommodation Centre ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/9957c-designated-
accommodation-centres-current-availability/) where meals and utilities are
provided, and you arrived in Ireland before 14 March 2024, you no longer
qualify for some social welfare payments. You will get the same rate of
payment as people who arrived after this date.

This means you will get a [ weekly payment
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/894dd-beneficiary-of-temporary-protection-
weekly-payment/) of €38.80 for an adult and €29.80 for a child, subject to an
income test. You will still be entitled to the [ Working Family Payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/working-family-payment/) and a monthly [ Child Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/families-and-children/child-benefit/) payment for qualifying
children. You can also apply for an [ Additional Needs Payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/additional-needs-payment/) .

  * If you are affected by the changes, you will get a letter from the Department of Social Protection. 
  * Designation of accommodation centres will be effective from September 2024. 
  * You will get a reduced payment from Thursday, 12 September 2024. 

If you leave a Designated Accommodation Centre or make your own accommodation
arrangements when you arrive in Ireland, you can apply for social welfare
payments, if you meet the standard eligibility conditions.
