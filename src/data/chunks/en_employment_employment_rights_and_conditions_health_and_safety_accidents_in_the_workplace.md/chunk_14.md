##  Being dismissed while on long-term sick leave

If you are dismissed from your job while on long-term certified sick leave,
you may bring a claim for [ unfair dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-
and-redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) against your employer (if certain
conditions are met).

If your illness is a disability under your rights under [ employment equality
legislation ](http://www.ihrec.ie/publications/list/ihrec-employment-equality-
rights-explained/) are also taken into account.
