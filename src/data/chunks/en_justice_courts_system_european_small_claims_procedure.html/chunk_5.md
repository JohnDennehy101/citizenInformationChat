###  Can I make a claim online?

You **cannot submit a claim online** under this procedure.

However, you can complete an application form on the European e-Justice Portal
using their [ online facility
](https://e-justice.europa.eu/dynform_intro_form_action.do?idTaxonomy=177&formSelectiondynform_sc_a_2_action)
, but this does not submit the application for you. It creates a PDF file
which you need to download and return to the Small Claims Registrar of your
local District Court office to start the procedure.
