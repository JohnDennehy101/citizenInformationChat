###  Defendant disputes or challenges the claim

The defendant disputes the claim. The Registrar will attempt to negotiate a
solution between you and the defendant. If this fails, the claim is referred
to the District Court for judgment.

The defendant may also challenge the claim on procedural grounds. For example,
they may argue that the claim is:

  * Outside the scope of the procedure 
  * A higher value than the â‚¬5,000 limit allowed 
  * Not a cross-border claim 

If the challenge to the claim on procedural grounds is successful, both you
and the respondent will be told within 30 days that the claim cannot proceed.
You can withdraw the claim and consider making a new claim under a different
relevant procedure.
