##  How does the European small claims procedure work?

The claimant submits the application form to the Small Claims Registrar at a
local District Court office (see ‘How to make a claim’ above).

The Registrar reviews the application form. If further information is needed,
you may be asked to complete a separate form to provide this within a certain
timeframe.

Once the Registrar is satisfied they have all of the information and that the
claim can proceed, they will prepare an answer form and send this to the
defendant within 14 days of the claim being made.

If either you or the defendant refuses to accept documentation because it is
not in a language you or the defendant understands, the court will ask the
other party to supply a translation.
