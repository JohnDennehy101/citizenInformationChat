###  Who are the parties in a claim?

If you are making the claim, you are known as the claimant. The person you are
claiming against is known as the defendant.

Either the claimant or the defendant must be domiciled or resident in an EU
country other than Ireland.

If both parties live or are based in Ireland, the [ Small claims procedure
](/en/justice/courts-system/small-claims-court/) should be used.
