###  **Direct effect**

As well as being superior to national law, some EU law has direct effect on
its citizens. This means that you can rely on EU law in court even in
situations where there is no national law in place. Direct effect only applies
to EU laws that are binding (see ‘Types of EU laws’ below), clear, precise and
unconditional.
