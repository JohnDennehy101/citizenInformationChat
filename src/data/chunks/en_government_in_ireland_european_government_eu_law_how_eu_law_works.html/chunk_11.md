####  Consent procedure

In this procedure, the Parliament and Council must pass the proposal before it
can become law, and neither institution has the power to amend the proposal.
This procedure is used where:

  * The EU needs the approval of the European Parliament but is not proposing legislation (for example, it wishes to sanction a member state for breaking EU rules) **or**
  * Where legislation on combating discrimination is proposed
