###  The _ordinary legislative procedure_

This is the procedure used unless the treaties state that another procedure
should be used (see ‘Special legislative procedure’ below)

EU laws begin at the European Commission (this is called the _right of
initiative_ ). The European Commission _proposes_ laws, either of its own
choosing or based on consultations with other EU institutions, member states
or public consultations.
