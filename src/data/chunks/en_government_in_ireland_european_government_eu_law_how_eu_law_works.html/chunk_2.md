##  Introduction

The primary laws of the [ European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/european-union/european-union/) (EU) are contained in the treaties
agreed between member states.

These treaties set out how the EU is structured and governed. They also give
powers to EU institutions to make and change secondary laws.

The EU has 3 legislative (or law making) institutions:

  * The [ European Commission ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-commission/) proposes new laws 
  * These proposals must be passed by both the [ European Parliament ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-parliament/) and the [ Council of the European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/council-of-the-european-union/)

Disputes about the interpretation of these laws may be referred to the [ Court
of Justice of the European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/eu-institutions/european-court-of-justice/) .

The EU uses 3 principles to decide in which areas it can make laws:

  * _Conferral_ – the EU’s authority is conferred on it by the Treaties. It cannot act beyond this authority 
  * _Proportionality_ – the EU should not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the aims of the Treaties 
  * _Subsidiarity_ – if national governments can act, then the EU should only act if a better outcome would result from an EU law
