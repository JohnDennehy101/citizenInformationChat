###  Environment

Many of Ireland’s environmental laws have come from the EU, including the
rights of access to information on environmental matters and public
participation in environmental decisions under the [ Aarhus Convention
](/en/environment/environment-and-the-law/aarhus-convention/) .

Ireland also has targets to reduce emissions that have been set as part of its
membership of the EU and through the Kyoto Protocol.

The European Court of Justice has made important rulings regarding Ireland’s
management of its environment.
