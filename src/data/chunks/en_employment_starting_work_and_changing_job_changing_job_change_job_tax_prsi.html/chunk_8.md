###  You didn’t give your employer your PPS number

You are taxed at the higher rate (40%) with no tax credits until you give your
employer your PPS number.

You can check Revenue’s [ current emergency tax and USC rates (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/documents/emergency-rates.pdf) .

To avoid emergency tax you should:

  1. Give your employer your PPSN 
  2. Register for [ Pay As You Earn (PAYE) in myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html)
