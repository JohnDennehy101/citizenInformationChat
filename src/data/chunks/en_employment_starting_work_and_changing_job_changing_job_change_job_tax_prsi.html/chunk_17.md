###  **Pensions**

Occupational pensions and PRSAs are regulated by the Pensions Authority. You
can get an overview of the pension arrangements available and the options that
might suit your situation in the free booklet [ What are my Pension Options?'
(pdf)
](http://www.pensionsauthority.ie/en/LifeCycle/Information_Booklets/What_are_my_pension_options_.11350.shortcut.pdf)

If you have queries about your pension, contact the Pensions Authority's
Information Unit. The Pensions Authority does not deal with the State pension.
Contact the Department of Social Protection if you have any questions about
your state pension, old age pension, contributory or non-contributory pension.
