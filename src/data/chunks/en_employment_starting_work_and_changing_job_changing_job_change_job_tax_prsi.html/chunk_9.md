##  Social insurance (PRSI)

Most employers and employees (between the ages of 16 and 66) pay social
insurance (PRSI) contributions to the National Social Insurance Fund. PRSI
helps pay for social welfare benefits and pensions.

You must give your new employer your [ Personal Public Service number (PPS
number) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) . This will make sure your
combined social welfare contributions are recorded and protect your
entitlement to benefits and pensions in the future. You can find more
