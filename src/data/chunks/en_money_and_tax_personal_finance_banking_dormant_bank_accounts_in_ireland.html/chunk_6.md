##  How can I reclaim money in a dormantaccount?

If you think you may have a dormant account, or if you have been notified that
you do, you should complete the Dormant Account Claim Form and send it
directly to the credit institution. The Dormant Account Claim Form is in the
Banking and Payments Federation Ireland booklet, [ A Guide to Dormant Accounts
(pdf) ](https://bpfi.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dormant-Account-Form-
September-2021-Website.pdf) . Send the completed Dormant Account Claim Form
directly to the credit institution

If the credit institution no longer exists, or has changed name, the Banking
and Payments Federation Ireland provides [ contact details for former banks
and building societies ](https://bpfi.ie/publications/dormant-accounts/) .
