##  When is an account dormant?

Your account becomes dormant on 30 September when you have made no
transactions in the previous 15 years.

The financial institution must notify you in writing, unless:

  * It has taken all reasonable steps to write to you but has not been able to or 
  * You have asked the institution not to contact you or 
  * You have an account with less than â‚¬100 

You have until 31 March of the following year to reactivate your account by
contacting the institution and carrying out a transaction on the account.

After that date, the funds are transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund. Even
if the funds or property have been transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund,
you or your next of kin still have a claim on your funds.
