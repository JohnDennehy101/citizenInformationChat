##  What is miscarriage?

If you lose your baby before 24 weeksâ€™ gestation, or before your baby reaches
a weight of 500 grams, this is called a miscarriage.

Miscarriage often happens with no warning, and there is often no medical
reason why it happened. This can be very distressing, and while you may
physically recover quite quickly, it can take much longer to recover
emotionally.

You can read more about [ the signs of miscarriage
