##  What is stillbirth?

If your baby is born after 24 weeks' gestation (or if your baby weighs more
than 500 grams) and they show no sign of life, this is called a stillbirth.

When a baby lives for only a few hours or days after birth, their death is
known as a ‘neonatal death’.

A stillbirth can happen for various reasons, but sometimes the cause is
unknown. Because of this, you may be asked to consent to a post-mortem
examination. It is normal to feel heartbroken and very distressed during this
time. [ Read more about stillbirth on the HSE website

At the hospital, the hospital staff will help with any wishes you might have –
for example, to hold your baby, or to take photographs. The hospital social
worker can refer you to bereavement counselling and link you to specialist
support services. You may also want to discuss having a religious service with
the hospital chaplain.

When you get home, your GP can refer you to specialist counselling if you are
finding it hard to cope. You can also find other ways of getting support
