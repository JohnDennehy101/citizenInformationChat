##  What is Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)?

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (or ‘SIDS’) refers to the sudden death of a
previously healthy baby under a year old. SIDS was previously known as ‘cot
death’.

Research shows that the cause of SIDS is unknown. This means that babies
appear healthy prior to their death, and SIDS cannot be prevented. You can
find more [ information about SIDS ](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/cot-
death/) on the HSE website.
