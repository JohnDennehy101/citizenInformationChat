####  Knowledge Development Box

The Knowledge Development Box (KDB) is being introduced to encourage companies
to develop intellectual property in Ireland. The KDB will provide that a
corporation tax rate of 6.25% will apply to the profits arising to certain
intellectual property assets which are the result of qualifying research and
development activity that is carried out in Ireland.
