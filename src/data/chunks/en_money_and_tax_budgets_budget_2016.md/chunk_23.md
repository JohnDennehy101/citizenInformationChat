####  Carers

The name of the **Respite Care Grant** will be changed to the **Carer’s
Support Grant** to better reflect how it is used by recipients. The grant will
increase by €325 to €1,700 per year for each person being cared for (June
2016). This will benefit 86,000 carers.

**Carer’s Allowance** will be paid for 12 weeks (currently 6 weeks) after the
death of the person being cared for (January 2016).
