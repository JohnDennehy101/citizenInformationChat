####  Childcare

From September 2016, the **Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme**
will be extended to children aged between 3 years and 5 years 6 months, or
until they start primary school. Children will be able to enroll in pre-school
at three different points in the year (September, January and April) in order
to access the scheme.

The number of places available under the **Community Childcare Subvention
Programme** will increase to 8,000.

A number of **supports to enable children with disabilities to fully
participate in pre-school care and education** will be phased in during 2016
at a cost of €15 million. Supports will include grants for equipment,
appliances, minor alterations, access to therapeutic intervention and training
for childcare staff.

€3.5 million is to be provided for **measures to improve quality in
childcare** .

A new **single affordable childcare programme** will be developed to replace
the existing Community Childcare Subvention (CCS), After-School Childcare
(ASCC) Scheme, Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme and
Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme. Work on the programme will
begin immediately, so that it can be in place by 2017.

A €3 million capital fund will be available to providers who need minor
funding to develop **after-school care services** using existing school and
other accessible community facilities.
