####  Local Property Tax (LPT)

Following a review of the Local Property Tax, it is proposed that the
revaluation date for the Local Property Tax should be postponed from 2016 to
2019\. The postponement of the date means that home owners will continue to
pay LPT based on the original valuations that applied for 2013-2016.

The review also proposes some changes as regards exemptions from LPT for
properties significantly affected by pyrite.
