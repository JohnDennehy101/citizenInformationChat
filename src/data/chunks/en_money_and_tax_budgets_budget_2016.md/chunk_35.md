###  Housing

A total of €811 million is allocated for housing programmes and the continued
delivery of the **Social Housing Strategy 2020** . In addition, local
authorities will directly provide some €112 million in funding to meet housing
needs.

**NAMA is to work with developers to deliver a target of 20,000 residential
units before the end of 2020** . 90% of these units will be in the Greater
Dublin Area and approximately 75% of them will be houses, mainly starter
homes. This will require funding of the order of €4.5 billion.

Funding for the **Seniors Alert programme** is increased by 10%, to provide
10,000 monitored alarms for older people.

A new **affordable rental pilot scheme** will be funded by €10 million from
the proceeds of the sale of Bord Gáis Eireann.
