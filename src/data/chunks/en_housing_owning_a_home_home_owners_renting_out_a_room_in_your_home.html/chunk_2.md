##  Introduction

If you rent out a room in your home, you have certain rights and
responsibilities. These are different depending on if you are renting a self-
contained unit, or a room in your home.

If you are renting a room in your home, you may be able to claim the [ rent-a-
room tax relief ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/renting-a-room-in-
your-home/) . This allows you to earn up to €14,000 per year in rent tax-free,
if you rent out a room in your home to private tenants.

There are additional rules for the rent-a-room relief if you are a local
authority tenant renting a room to a student, or if you are renting a room to
someone getting the Housing Assistance Payment.

If you are getting a means-tested weekly social assistance payment, you can
get up to €14,000 per year for renting out a room in your own home without it
affecting your social welfare payment.
