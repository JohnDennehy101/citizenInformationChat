##  Polling station accessibility

Whenever possible, polling stations are located in buildings that are
accessible to people with disabilities. Polling stations must always be at the
ground floor level. Temporary ramps can be installed to facilitate access.

Voting compartments in polling stations are usually designed for people who
are standing up. The [ returning officer ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-
information/68176-irelands-returning-officers/) (the person responsible for
organising the election or referendum in your constituency) must make a table
and chair available for voters who need to sit down.
