###  Companion voting

If you have a visual impairment, a disability or a literacy difficulty that
prevents you from voting without assistance, you can bring a companion with
you to mark the ballot paper for you.

This person must be at least 16 years old and cannot:

  * Be an election candidate or a candidateâ€™s agent 
  * Help more than 2 people vote per election 

If the presiding officer does not believe that the person you choose is
eligible to act as a companion, another person can act as your companion or
you can ask the presiding officer to assist you.

When a companion is assisting you, they go into a voting compartment with you
and you tell them how to mark the ballot. The companion then places the marked
ballot paper in the ballot box.
