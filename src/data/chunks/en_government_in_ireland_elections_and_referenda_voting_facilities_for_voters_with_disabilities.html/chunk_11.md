##  How to vote by post

Shortly before polling day, you will be sent the following documents:

  * A ballot paper 
  * A receipt for the ballot paper 
  * An envelope for the marked ballot paper 
  * A larger envelope addressed to the returning officer 

When you have marked the ballot paper, put it into the envelope marked "Ballot
Paper Envelope" and seal it. You then put this envelope and the completed
receipt for the ballot paper into the large envelope addressed to the
returning officer, seal it and post it.

The ballot paper must be posted - it cannot be given directly to the returning
officer.
