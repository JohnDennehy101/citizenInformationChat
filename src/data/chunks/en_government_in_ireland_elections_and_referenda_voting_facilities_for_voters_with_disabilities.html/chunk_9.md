###  Using a ballot paper template

A ballot paper template is a transparent plastic device that is placed on top
of a ballot paper. The template has raised print and braille on it, so that
visually impaired people can vote without assistance. You can use this option
if you have a visual impairment and don't want to be helped by a companion or
presiding officer to mark your ballot paper.

The template is used with a Freephone number that identifies the candidates in
your area. If you want to listen to this information before polling day, you
can get the number from your local authority or returning officer. You can
listen to the information before polling day to familiarise yourself with it
and/or you can use your mobile phone to call the number while you are in the
polling compartment.

Ballot paper templates are available at each polling station. If you tell the
presiding officer that you want to use a template, you will be handed a ballot
paper with the template attached to it.

Raised print and Braille are used to identify the openings in the template
that match the squares on the ballot paper. You mark your choices on the
ballot paper beneath the template. There is a flap over each opening, so that
you can close the flap when you have marked a square. When you have finished
marking the ballot paper, you can detach it from the template, fold it and
place it in the ballot box in the usual way.
