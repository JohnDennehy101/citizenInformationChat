##  Introduction

Human trafficking is the transporting of people for exploitation. Victims are
trafficked into various types of work, including farm work, domestic work and
forced prostitution. They may be subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of
violence.

If you consider yourself or somebody else to be a victim of human trafficking,
you should [ report your concerns ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/reporting-a-
crime/) to the [ Garda Síochána ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-siochana-
national-police-force/) (Irish police force). In an emergency, you should call
999 or 112.

You can also get help from the Health Service Executive’s (HSE) [ Anti-Human
Trafficking Team ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/5/sexhealth/whp/) , or
any of the organisations listed in the section titled, ‘Support for victims of
human trafficking’ below.
