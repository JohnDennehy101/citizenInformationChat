###  PRSI inspections

Every year, inspectors from the Department of Social Protection (DSP) visit
many employers. This is to find employers who:

  * Don’t pay any PRSI contributions for their employees 
  * Don’t keep proper records for their employees 
  * Encourage employees to claim jobseeker payments 
  * Understate wages being paid to employees 

The DSP's inspectors have power to inspect records. There are penalties for
people who obstruct or refuse to supply information, or who fail to keep or
produce records and documents.
