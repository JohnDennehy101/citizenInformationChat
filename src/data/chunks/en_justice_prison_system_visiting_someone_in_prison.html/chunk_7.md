###  Security

Airport-style walk-through detectors and x-ray scanners are installed in every
closed prison in Ireland, and sniffer dogs from the Garda Canine Unit may also
be present for the purposes of detecting banned substances.

You may be searched to ensure that you are not in possession of prohibited
materials upon entering the prison. The search must be carried out with due
regard to your decency and it must be conducted by at least 2 prison guards of
your gender.

If you do not consent to be searched, the governor can refuse you entry to the
prison.
