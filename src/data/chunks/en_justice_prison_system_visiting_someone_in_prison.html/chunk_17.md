###  Foreign nationals

The following rules apply if you are a foreign national:

  * A foreign national is entitled to receive a visit from their consul 
  * A stateless person is entitled to receive a visit from the consul of a state of their choosing 
  * An asylum applicant is entitled to receive a visit from a consul of a state of their choosing, as well as any national or international organisations deemed appropriate by the Minister for Justice 

Unless the governor otherwise directs, all such visits to foreign nationals
will take place in the hearing and view of a prison officer.
