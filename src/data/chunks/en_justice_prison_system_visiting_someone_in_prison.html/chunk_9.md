###  The visit

All prisons implement certain measures to regulate and monitor visits in the
interests of health and safety. Most visits are supervised in sight, but not
in hearing.

For example, while prisons must provide facilities to allow a prisoner and
visitor to see and talk to one another, the visit may be screened with the use
of glass, or other types of screens, to prevent physical contact.

It is at the discretion of the prison governor to allow physical contact
between a prisoner and a visitor when they are satisfied that such contact
will not facilitate the entry into the prison of controlled drugs or other
prohibited articles or substances.

The Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas has [ published a guide (pdf)
](https://www.icpo.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Guidelines-For-Visiting-
Prisoners.pdf) on how to get the most out of a prison visit, including advice
on planning visits and respecting prison rules.
