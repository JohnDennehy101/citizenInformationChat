##  Introduction

If a member of your family is in prison, visits can help you stay in contact
and maintain a healthy relationship. You can also keep in touch by letter and
your family member can contact you by telephone.

Prison visits are important to maintain relationships and support the
prisoner's mental wellbeing. Stable family relationships and community ties
have also been recognised as important factors in helping with the [
resettlement and reintegration ](https://www.irishprisons.ie/prisoner-
services/reintegration/) of prisoners in civil society.

The rules governing prison visits in Ireland are set out in [ sections 35-50
of Prison Rules, 2007
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2007/si/252/made/en/print#article35) .

You can find out more about the process of [ requesting a professional visit
](https://www.irishprisons.ie/visiting-a-prison/requesting-a-professional-
visit/) to a prisoner on the Irish Prison Service website.
