###  The means test

If you are aged between 66 and 70 and are not getting a qualifying social
welfare payment, you must pass a means test. In a means test, the Department
of Social Protection (DSP) examines all your sources of income. Your weekly
income must be below a certain amount to pass the means test.

The amount of means that you are allowed to have for the HBP is the current
maximum rate of [ State Pension (Contributory) ](/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory#l62fd2)
including any increases that you might get for your age, living alone and
dependants, plus â‚¬200.

The main items included in the means test are:

  * **Cash income** that you or your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant may have. Some [ cash income may not be included in the means test ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/cash-income-not-included-in-the-social-welfare-means-test/) . 
  * **Capital** , for example, the value of savings, investments, shares or any property you have (but not your own home).

If you are applying for the Household Benefits Package and you need to pass a
means test, a separate means test form will be sent to you to fill in.
