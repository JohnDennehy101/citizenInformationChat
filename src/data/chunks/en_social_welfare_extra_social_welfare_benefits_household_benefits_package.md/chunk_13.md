###  Electricity or Gas Allowance

If you have an electricity and natural gas supply, you must choose between the
Electricity Allowance and Gas Allowance. You can choose only one.

The Allowance does not cover the cost of installing an electricity or natural
gas supply to your home.

**Allowance paid as cash**

If you are getting the Allowance paid as cash, this is paid either to your
bank account or post office account on the first Tuesday of each month (if you
are collecting your Allowance from the post office using your [ Public
Services Card ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/public-services-card/) , you have 90 days to collect
your payment).

Your name does not need to be on the bill if you are getting the Allowance
paid as cash.

**Allowance paid as a credit on your bill**

If your energy supplier is Electric Ireland for electricity, or Bord Gáis for
gas, the Allowance can be paid directly to your energy supplier as a credit
against your bill each month. The bill must be in your name if you want the
Allowance paid as a credit.

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) will contact Electric Ireland or
Bord Gáis, who will then apply the Allowance, including any backdated credit,
onto your next bill. You pay for any electricity or gas you use above the
Allowance in the normal way.

**Changing energy supplier**

If you change your energy supplier, you must tell the DSP. You must provide
proof of your new energy supplier (for example, a gas or electricity bill)
from the date you changed over.
