##  Civil partnerships

Under the [ Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of
Cohabitants Act 2010,
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0024/index.html) a statutory
civil partnership registration scheme for same-sex couples was introduced to
give legal recognition of same-sex couples. Under the scheme, registered civil
partners have broadly the same rights and obligations towards each other as
married couples.

However, following the passing of the referendum in 2015 on legalising same-
sex marriage and the enactment of the Marriage Act 2015, civil partnerships
are no longer granted in Ireland.

Civil partnerships that existed before 2015 are still recognised, and existing
partnerships are automatically dissolved if the couple decide to marry.
