** Social welfare entitlements for cohabitants  **

Cohabiting couples (including same-sex couples) are treated the same as
married couples. This means that, when one cohabitant makes a claim for a
social welfare payment, the other cohabitant is treated as an [ adult
dependant ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-
welfare-payment/claiming-an-increase-in-your-social-welfare-payment-for-an-
adult-dependant/) .
