###  Redress scheme for cohabitants

The 2010 Act also introduced a [ redress scheme for cohabiting couples
](/en/birth-family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-
relationships/redress-scheme-for-cohabiting-couples/) (including same-sex
cohabiting couples), which protects a financially dependent cohabitant in the
event of the relationship ending.

This means the financially-dependent partner can apply to the Court, and the
Court can make orders similar to those available to married couples when they
separate or divorce (for example, a property adjustment order or a
compensatory maintenance order). Or, if one cohabitant dies, the surviving
cohabitant can apply to the Court for provision from the estate of the
deceased cohabitant.

To be a qualified cohabitant for the redress scheme, you must have lived
together for at least 5 years, or for 2 years if you have a child with your
partner. If one of you is still married, then neither of you can be a
qualified cohabitant until the married person has been living apart from their
spouse for at least 4 of the previous 5 years.
