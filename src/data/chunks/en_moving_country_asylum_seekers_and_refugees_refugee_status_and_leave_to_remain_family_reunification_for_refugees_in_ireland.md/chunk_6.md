##  Decisions and next steps

When your application is processed, ISD will send you a decision. If your
application is approved your family can make arrangements to join you in
Ireland, or (if they are already in Ireland) they can [ register their
permission ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-
ireland/registration-of-non-eea-nationals-in-ireland/) and get an Irish
Residence Permit.

The letter granting you permission will have information about what to do
next. If your family member does not have a passport and is unable to get one,
you may have to [ apply for a travel document ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/refugee-status-and-leave-to-remain/travel-documents-for-
refugees/) for them. They will also need a [ visa to enter Ireland
](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/visa-requirements-for-entering-
ireland/) if they are from a visa required country.

Your family must join you before the date stated on the decision letter. If
they have not joined you by that date, your application could be withdrawn and
you would have to apply again

Your family’s residence in Ireland is based on your international protection
status. If your international protection status is withdrawn or you no longer
have permission to live in Ireland, your family’s permission may also be
withdrawn.
