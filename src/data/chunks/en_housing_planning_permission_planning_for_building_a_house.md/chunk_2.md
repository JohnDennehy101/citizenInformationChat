##  Introduction

If you are planning to build a house, you must first get planning permission
from your local authority. This is required by law for almost every
development.

It is illegal to carry out any work if you donâ€™t have the required planning
permission. You may be fined and possibly imprisoned if you build without the
required planning permission.

However, if a genuine mistake has been made, you can apply for planning
permission to keep an unauthorised structure in place, but this permission is
not guaranteed. If permission is refused after the building is complete, you
will have to demolish the unauthorised structure.
