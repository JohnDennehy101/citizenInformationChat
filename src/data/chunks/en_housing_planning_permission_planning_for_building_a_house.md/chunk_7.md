##  Can I appeal?

If the local authority refuses your application, they will give you the
reasons for their decision. You then have one month to [ appeal this decision
](/en/housing/planning-permission/appealing-planning-permission-decision/) to
[ An Bord Plean√°la ](http://www.pleanala.ie/) .

You must not start building before you are granted planning permission.
