###  4\. Give notice to your employer

You must give your employer at least 6 weeks’ notice in writing saying when
and how you plan to take carer’s leave, and whether it will be in one block or
separate periods. You should confirm that you have applied to DSP for a
decision on the person for whom you propose to care. You can find a sample
notice of intention form in Appendix A of the [ Carer's Leave Act explanatory
booklet (pdf)
](https://employmentrightsadvice.ie/Documents/Guide_to_the_Carers_Leave_Act.pdf)
. In emergency situations where you cannot give 6 weeks' notice, you should
give notice as soon as possible.
