###  5\. Confirmation of carerâ€™s leave

You and your employer must sign a document confirming the arrangement for
carer's leave, at least 2 weeks before you begin the leave. The document
should state the start date, how long it will last, and specify how you will
take it. You can find a sample confirmation document in Appendix B of the
Carer's Leave Act explanatory booklet (pdf). Your employer keeps the signed
document and gives you a copy of it.

This document is flexible, which means that your arrangement to take carer's
leave can be amended, even if you have already started your leave.
