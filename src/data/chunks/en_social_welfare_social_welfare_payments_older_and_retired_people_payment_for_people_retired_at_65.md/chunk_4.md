If you don't have 39 PRSI contributions in the Governing Contribution Year, you can use 26 PRSI contributions paid in the governing contribution year and 26 paid in the year immediately before this. 

***** If you do not have 13 paid contributions in the governing contribution
year, you must have paid 13 contributions in any of the following years:

  * The current tax year 
  * The last complete tax year 
  * The 2 tax years before the governing contribution year 

The Governing Contribution Year is the second-last complete tax year before
the year in which your claim is made. So, for claims made in 2024, the
Governing Contribution Year is 2022.
