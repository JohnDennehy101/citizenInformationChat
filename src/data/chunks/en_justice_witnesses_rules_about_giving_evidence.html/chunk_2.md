##  Introduction

When you are giving evidence, the lawyers and the judge can object to certain
things you say. This is because there are legal rules about what [ evidence
](/en/justice/evidence/evidence-introduction/) you can give.

The judge can interrupt you and ask you to stop if one of the rules of
evidence is being broken.

It is also a criminal offence to give evidence which you know is false. This
is known as perjury.
