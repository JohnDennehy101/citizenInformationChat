##  What is the waiting period for maternity claims?

If you are buying health insurance in Ireland for the first time, there is a
waiting period of up to 52 weeks for maternity cover.

Depending on your plan, your insurance may pay the cost of some or all of the
following after 52 weeks:

  * Out-patient private consultant fees, which cover the routine visits to your consultant before the birth 
  * Hospital accommodation in a private room or a semi-private (shared) room in a public hospital 
  * Delivery consultantâ€™s fees at the time of delivery 
  * Other consultants' fees at the time of delivery 
  * Fees for a home birth 

If you are pregnant and are not covered for maternity services under private
health insurance, you can still access [ maternity care through the public
healthcare system ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-services/) . All
pregnant people who are ordinarily resident in Ireland are entitled to free
maternity care. This includes antenatal visits, labour and delivery, and
postnatal care.

If you have a baby, they do not have to serve a waiting period if you add them
to your health insurance policy within 13 weeks of their birth.
