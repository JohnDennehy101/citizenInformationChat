##  Introduction

Private health insurance helps you pay for private medical care. This can be
in a hospital or from other health professionals. If you are [ ordinarily
resident ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
system/entitlement-to-public-health-services/#094550) in Ireland, you can
access a range of public health services whether or not you have private
health insurance.

If you get healthcare in a public hospital as a public patient, you may need
to pay hospital charges. [ Medical card holders
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) and certain other groups do not have to pay hospital
charges.

This page outlines what you need to know about buying health insurance when
you return to Ireland.
