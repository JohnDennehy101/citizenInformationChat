##  Do I have to buy private health insurance in Ireland?

You do not have to buy private health insurance in Ireland. If you are [
ordinarily resident ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
system/entitlement-to-public-health-services/#094550) in Ireland, you can
access public health services for [ free or at a reduced cost
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/gp-and-
hospital-services/hospital-charges/) .

The main benefits of private health insurance in Ireland are:

  * Cover for hospital accommodation in a private or shared room 
  * Cover for inpatient consultant services as a private patient 
  * Other cover including maternity, overseas, psychiatric, and outpatient benefits 

In some cases, you may have a shorter wait time for an appointment using your
private medical insurance.

You can still access public health services if you have private health
insurance. For example, if your General Practitioner (GP) refers you to a
specialist consultant in a hospital, you can decide if you want to be treated
through the public or the private system. Similarly, if admitted to hospital,
you will need to tell the hospital whether you want to be admitted as a public
or a private patient.

If you are a public patient, you do not have the right to choose your
consultant.
