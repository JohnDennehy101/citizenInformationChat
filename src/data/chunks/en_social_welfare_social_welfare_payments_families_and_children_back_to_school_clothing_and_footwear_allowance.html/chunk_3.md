##  Can I get the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance?

You can get the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) if you
have a child that qualifies, and:

  * You are getting a qualifying social welfare payment, or are participating in an approved employment, education or training support scheme. See [ a list of qualifying payments and schemes ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/86a6ba-operational-guidelines-back-to-school-clothing-and-footwear-scheme/#annex-a) on Gov.ie 
  * Your household is within the BSCFA income limits (see ‘Income limits’ below) 
  * You and each child you claim the BSCFA for are resident in Ireland. 

If you are getting a social welfare payment, you must be getting an [ Increase
for a Qualified Child (IQC) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-
payment/claiming-and-increase-in-your-payment-for-a-child-dependant/) with
your payment. There are some exceptions to this (see ‘I don’t get an IQC’
below).
