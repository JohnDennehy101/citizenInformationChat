##  Apply for a PPS number for a child who was born abroad

If you are returning home to Ireland with a child who was born abroad, you may
need a PPS number for that child.

You can't apply for your children's PPS numbers until you are back in Ireland.
However, you can download and complete the [ application form for a child's
PPS number (REG1M) (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/71516/89e65d7310ae4557b3537383c61c781f.pdf) so that
it's ready to submit to [ your nearest PPS Number Allocation Centre
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f3690a-personal-public-service-pps-number-
allocation-centres-by-county/) when you arrive.

You'll need to complete a separate form for each child.

You need proof of:

  * Your own identity 
  * The childâ€™s identity 
  * The reason they need a PPS number (for example, to access medical services) 
  * Your relationship with the child 
  * Your address. If you are living temporarily with friends or family, you can ask the named bill payer to write on their addressed utility bill to confirm you are staying at their address. You can also ask the manager of a hotel or hostel to confirm you are staying with them. 

The Department of Social Protection may contact you to confirm your
relationship with the child.
