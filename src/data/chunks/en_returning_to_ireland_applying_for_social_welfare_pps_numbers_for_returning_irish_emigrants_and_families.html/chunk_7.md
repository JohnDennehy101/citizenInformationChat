###  **Supporting documents**

When you apply for a PPS number, you must show:

  * **Proof of why you need a PPS number** , for example, because you are starting a new job and need to register for tax with Revenue, or because you need to apply for a social welfare payment. 
  * **Proof of your identity** , including your birth certificate and photo ID. Read more about what is accepted as [ proof of identity to get a PPS number ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/12e6de-get-a-personal-public-service-pps-number/#rules) on Gov.ie. 
  * **Proof of your address** , such as a utility bill or bank statement. As you are returning home from abroad, you may not have a utility bill with your name on it. In this case, the Department of Social Protection will accept non-standard proof of address. For example, if you are living temporarily with friends or family, you can ask the named bill payer to write on their addressed utility bill to confirm you are staying at their address. You can also ask the manager of a hotel or hostel to confirm you are staying with them. 

**How to apply**

You must wait until you are back in Ireland to apply for your PPS number. You
can [ apply for a PPS number online
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/identity-services/personal-public-
service-pps-number/) if you have registered for a [ basic MyGovID account
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/egovernment/mygovid/) .

There is a service that lets people apply for a PPS number when they live
outside Ireland, but need to engage with a specified body in Ireland (for
example, the Probate Office). In these cases, you can contact the Department
of Social Protectionâ€™s, [ Client Identity Services (CIS)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/personal-public-service-
number/index.aspx) . This service is not available to people relocating to
Ireland.

You can contact them by:

  * Email at [ cis@welfare.ie ](mailto:cis@welfare.ie)
  * Telephone at **0818 927 999** (or **+353 71 967 2616** , if calling from abroad) 

They will send you the forms to request a new PPSN.

When you have returned these forms, they will then write to you with a
response.
