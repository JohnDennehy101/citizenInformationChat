###  Out-patient treatment

Out-patient treatment options include:

  * Out-patient clinics 
  * Day hospitals or day centres 
  * Home visits from the mental health team 
  * Clinical psychological services 
  * Addiction counselling services 
  * Social work or occupational therapy services 
  * GP care 

**Out-patient and community services**

The aim of out-patient and community services is to treat and support
individuals in their own homes and communities where possible. GPs are central
to the delivery of community care services.

An **out-patient clinic** is a clinic that you attend for an assessment or for
follow-up treatment. These facilities are often based in community health
centres and are staffed by a consultant psychiatrist, community psychiatric
nurses and other members of the mental health team, as required.

A **day hospital** is a day facility you can attend from home or from a care
setting, for assessment, treatment or nursing care. It is usually seen as an
alternative to hospital admission. The consultant psychiatrist who sees you in
an out-patient clinic will usually treat you in the day hospital also.

You may attend a **day centre** in your community for continuing support. Day
centres are staffed by psychiatric nurses and, occasionally, occupational
therapists. The aim is to provide activities in a friendly and supportive
environment.

A **sheltered workshop** is a community facility where the emphasis is on work
activity suited to your skills or needs with support and guidance from trained
staff.
