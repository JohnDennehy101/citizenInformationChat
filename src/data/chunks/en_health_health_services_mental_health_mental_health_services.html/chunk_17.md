Most people who have mental health problems are treated without going to
hospital or may go to hospital for treatment by choice. If you are admitted by
choice you are known as a voluntary patient.

Occasionally, someone may have to be admitted for mental health treatment and
care against their will. This is called involuntary admission. You can only be
admitted against your will under rules that are set out in law to make sure
this only happens if it is absolutely necessary.
