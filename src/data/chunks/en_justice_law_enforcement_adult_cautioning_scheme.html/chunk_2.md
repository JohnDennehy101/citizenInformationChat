##  What is the Adult Cautioning Scheme?

If you are an adult (aged over 18) and charged with certain criminal offences,
you may be given a caution instead of being prosecuted.

The Adult Cautioning Scheme may be available if there is evidence that the
person has committed a specific offence and the garda√≠ believe that
prosecuting the offence is not in the public interest.

Adult cautions may not be disclosed in [ Garda vetting reports
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/data-protection-at-work/garda-vetting/) or [ police certificates
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/moving-abroad/leaving-
ireland/police-certificate/) . However, cautions are disclosed if you are
later convicted of an offence.

The scheme can only be used if you are charged with the specific criminal
offences listed below.
