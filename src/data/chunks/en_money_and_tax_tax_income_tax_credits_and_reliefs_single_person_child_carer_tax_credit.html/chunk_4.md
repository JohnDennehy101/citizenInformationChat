###  Primary claimant

The _primary claimant_ is the person with whom a qualifying child (see below)
lives for more than 6 months of the year.

If both parents have equal custody (by court order), entitlement to the credit
is decided by which parent gets [ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-
and-children/child-benefit/) from the Department of Social Protection. A child
who is living away from home while attending college is considered a
qualifying child if they are still maintained by the claimant and return home
outside of term-time.
