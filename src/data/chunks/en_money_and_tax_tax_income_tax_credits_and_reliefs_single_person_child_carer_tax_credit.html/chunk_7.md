####  Surrendering your entitlement

If you are the primary claimant and you do not want to claim the credit, you
can _surrender_ (give up) your entitlement to the credit. This surrender will
remain in place until you withdraw it. You will then have the credit restored
to you at the beginning of the following tax year. (For example, if you
withdraw your surrender on 15 May 2024, the SPCCC will be restored for the tax
years from 2025 onwards).
