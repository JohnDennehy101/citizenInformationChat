##  Introduction

If you are serving a prison sentence in Ireland, there are several ways you
can be released into the community.

In addition to completing the full term of your sentence, you may be granted
periods of temporary or permanent release in recognition of good conduct in
custody, notably by engaging in authorised structured activities that are
designed to reduce your likelihood of reoffending.

This page outlines the ways you can be released from prison. It provides
information on:

  * Remission 
  * Temporary release 
  * Parole 
  * Resettlement and reintegration into the community
