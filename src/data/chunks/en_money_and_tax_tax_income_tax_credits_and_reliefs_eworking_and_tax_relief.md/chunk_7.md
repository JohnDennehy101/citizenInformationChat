####  Amount of tax relief

When you know the amount of costs that you can get tax relief on you can
calculate your tax savings. You get tax relief on the amount of your costs at
a rate of 20% or 40%, whichever is the highest rate of income tax you pay.

If your employer pays you an allowance towards your expenses, that amount paid
is deducted from the amount you can claim back from Revenue.
