###  Example 2

Sharon and Lar are married and both worked from home for 181 days in 2020
while their offices were closed due to COVID-19. Their household bills for
heating and electricity come to €1,950 and their broadband comes to €600. They
split the bills equally between them and each calculate the portion they can
claim.

( **Note:** when calculating relief for 2020, divide by 366 days because it
was a leap year. For other years, divide by 365 days.)

**Cost of electricity and heat**

Amount paid each €975 x 181 = 176,475

Divided by 366 = €482

10% allowable cost = **€48**

**Cost of broadband**

Amount paid each €300 x 181 = 54,300

Divided by 366 = €148

30% allowable cost = **€45**

At the end of the year, Sharon and Lar can **each** claim tax back on expenses
of:

  * €48 for heating and electricity 
  * €45 for broadband 
  * **€93** in total 

The amount they gets back depends on their rate of tax. If they pay tax at the
higher tax rate of 40% they will **each** get €37.20 back (40% of €93). If
they pay tax at the lower rate of 20%, they will each get €18.60 back (20% of
€93).
