##  Introduction

Financial institutions such as banks, credit unions and building societies use
different terms for the interest you are charged or earn on their financial
products.

The four most common terms you will see are:

  * Annual Percentage Rate (APR) 
  * Equivalent Annual Rate (EAR) 
  * Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) 
  * Compound Annual Rate (CAR) 

APR and EAR are used for the interest you are charged on loans and overdrafts.

AER, CAR and EAR can be used for the interest you earn on savings.
