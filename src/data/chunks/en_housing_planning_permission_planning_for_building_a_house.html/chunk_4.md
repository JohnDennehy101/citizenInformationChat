##  How to apply for planning permission

There are two basic steps.

**1: Notify the public about your plans**

You must notify the public about your plans before you apply for planning
permission:

  * Place a notice in a local newspaper (your local authority can provide a list for your area) 
  * Put up a site notice which is visible and easily read 

The site notice must be put up on or before the day you apply and remain there
for at least 5 weeks.

**Days over Christmas holiday period don’t count:** The 9 days over Christmas,
from 24 December to 1 January, are not considered when calculating the 5-week
period.

The OPR’s [ Guide to Making a Planning Application ](https://www.opr.ie/wp-

Application.pdf) has information about what to include in the notices.

**2\. Send in your application to the local authority**

Fill in a planning application form and submit it with the relevant documents
to your local authority.

Application forms are available from [ your local authority.
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/)

Your planning application must be received by the local authority within 2
weeks of the notice appearing in the newspaper.

Your planning permission is valid for 5 years after it is granted.
