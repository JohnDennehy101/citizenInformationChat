##  How do I request more time with my grandchildren?

You should first speak to the childâ€™s parents or guardians. Negotiation should
be explored, to try and come to an arrangement so that you can spend time with
your grandchildren.

If no agreement can be reached, you should consider [ family mediation
](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/family-mediation-
separating-couples/) . This is where a trained independent professional,
called a _mediator_ , helps you and the parents come to an agreement in a safe
space. Mediation addresses the needs and interests of everyone involved.

Mediation can have better long-term effects on the family as a whole, as both
sides take ownership of the arrangement they come to. The process is much less
confrontational than the matter being dealt with in court.

If mediation is not successful, you can apply to the court for _access_ to
your grandchildren.

In certain situations, you can apply for _custody_ or _guardianship_ . Read
about access, custody, and guardianship below.
