###  Kinship care

In some circumstances, grandparents, other relatives or a family friend may
take on the full-time care of children and young people, when parents are not
able to care for them. Sometimes this is referred to as a private family
arrangement or ‘kinship care’. Most kinship care arrangements are informal
unlike relative foster care which is a formal arrangement. Information and
support for kinship carers in Ireland is available at [ kinshipcare.ie
](https://www.kinshipcare.ie/) .
