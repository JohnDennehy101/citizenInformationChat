##  Applying for access to a grandchild

If you are having difficulty maintaining contact with your grandchildren, you
can apply for _access_ through [ your local District Court
](https://www.courts.ie/content/find-us) . Access means you will have a legal
right to direct contact with the child, which may include overnight stays
(sleepovers).

Before granting your application, the court will consider:

  * Your existing connection with the child 
  * Any risk of harmful disruption to the child's life 
  * The wishes of the child’s parents or guardians 
  * The wishes of the child if they are capable of forming their own views 

To make an application for access, you must complete a form called _Form
58.19_ and submit it to the court. You can [ download Form 58.19 (docx)
](https://www.courts.ie/acc/alfresco/9db36de7-9639-4a97-8689-b1d7f588a37f/Notice%20of%20application%20under%20section%2011b%20for%20an%20order%20giving%20access%20-%20Guardianship%20of%20Children%20Acts%2C%201964%20to%201997%20No.%2058.19.docx/doc/1)

interests are set out in [ Section 63 of the Children and Family Relationships
Act 2015

Infants Act 1964, as amended
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1964/act/7/revised/en/html#SEC11B) .
