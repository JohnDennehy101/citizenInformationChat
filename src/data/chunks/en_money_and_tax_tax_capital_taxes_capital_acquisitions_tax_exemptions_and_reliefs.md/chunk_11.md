###  Favourite nephew or niece relief

If you are the nephew or niece of the person who gives you a gift or
inheritance, the Group A tax-free threshold may apply if you have worked in
their business for the previous 5 years.

Being the nephew or niece of the person giving the benefit means that you are
the child of their brother or sister (their sibling) or of their siblingâ€™s
civil partner.

To qualify, you must have worked in the business for more than:

  * 24 hours per week or 
  * 15 hours per week if the only others who worked there were the giver and their spouse or civil partner 

The relief applies only to assets used in the business. The Group B threshold
applies to non-business assets.
