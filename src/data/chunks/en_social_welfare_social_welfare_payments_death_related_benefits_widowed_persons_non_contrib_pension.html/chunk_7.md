###  Income from your home (such as rent)

The value of the house you live in is not taken into account in the means
test. Income you are getting from your home (for example renting a room) can
be taken into account. However, the following exceptions apply:

  * You are living alone: If renting out the room means that you would not be living alone, then your income from rent is not taken into account. 
  * You are **not** living alone: You can get up to [ €269.23 a week (€14,000 per year) from renting a room in your home ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) without it affecting your Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner’s (Non-Contributory) Pension. The person renting a room in your home must use the room for a minimum of 28 consecutive days and not be an employee or immediate family member. 

You should check if renting a room in your home will affect your [ Fuel
Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/)
.

The [ Accommodation Recognition Payment ](/en/moving-country/ukrainian-
refugees-in-ireland/accommodation-recognition-payment/) for hosting refugees
from Ukraine is not assessed in the means test for the Widow's, Widower's or
Surviving Civil Partner’s (Non-Contributory) Pension.
