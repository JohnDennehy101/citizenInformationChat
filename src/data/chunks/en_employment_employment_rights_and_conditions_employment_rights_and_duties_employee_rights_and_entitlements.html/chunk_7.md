##  Maximum working week

In general, your maximum average working week cannot be more than 48 hours.
This doesn't mean you can't work more than 48 hours in a week, but that your
average weekly hours over 4 months should not exceed 48.

There are some exceptions to this, which you can read about on our page on the
[ working week ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/hours-of-
work/working-hours/) .
