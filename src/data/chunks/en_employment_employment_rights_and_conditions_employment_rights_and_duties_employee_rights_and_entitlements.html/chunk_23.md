and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-payments/) , you must have been working
for your employer for 2 consecutive years and meet other criteria.

Dismissal occurs when you lose your job, but the position remains open and
could be filled by someone else.

Reasons for dismissal can be [ fair ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/fair-grounds-for-dismissal/) or [ unfair

consecutive to bring a claim for unfair dismissal.
