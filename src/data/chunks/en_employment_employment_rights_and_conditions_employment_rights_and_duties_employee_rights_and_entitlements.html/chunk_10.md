####  Payslips

You must be given a [ pay slip
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/pay_and_employment/pay_slip.en.html)
every time you are paid your wages. A pay slip will show your gross wage (that
means your total earnings before tax) and details of all deductions.

Your employer must have your permission to make deductions from your wages,
unless these deductions are covered by law (for example, PAYE, PRSI and USC).
