####  **What if I'm homeless when I return?**

If you will be homeless when you return to Ireland, you can get emergency
accommodation from the local authority in the area where you have a local
connection. As part of this, you will need to complete an application for
social housing. You can read more on the [ housing supports available for
homeless people ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/losing-your-
home-and-homelessness/supports-for-homeless-people/) .
