####  **Can I apply for an affordable housing scheme when I return?**

If you have not previously purchased a property in Ireland or abroad, you may
qualify for the [ First Home Scheme (FHS)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/first-home-scheme/) . The FHS is a shared equity scheme. This
means that the State and participating banks pay up to 30% of the cost of your
new home in return for a stake in the home. Read more about [ the First Home
Scheme and answers to frequently asked questions

There is a similar [ Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/local-authority-affordable-purchase-scheme/) where the local
authority buys a stake in your home. However, this scheme only applies in
certain areas.

You may qualify for the [ Help to Buy Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-
buying-a-home/help-to-buy-scheme/) . This scheme gives a refund of the [
income tax ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/) and [
Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-on-savings-and-
investments/deposit-interest-retention-tax/) you have paid in Ireland in the
previous 4 tax years. However, you must have paid a certain amount of tax in
Ireland in the last 4 years to be eligible.
