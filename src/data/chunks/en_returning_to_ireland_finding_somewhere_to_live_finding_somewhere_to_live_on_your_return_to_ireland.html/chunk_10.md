##  Can I get nursing home care when Ireturn to Ireland?

If you or a family member needs nursing home care when you return, you should
find a nursing home that meets your needs. You can find a [ list of registered
nursing homes on the HIQA website ](https://www.hiqa.ie/areas-we-work/find-a-
centre/map) . The HSE also has a [ guide to choosing a nursing home (pdf)
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/4/olderpeople/residentialcare/nursinghomechecklist.pdf)
.

If you need help paying for nursing home care, you can apply to the Nursing
Home Support Scheme, also known as the [ Fair Deal Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/health-
services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/) . You must be ordinarily resident
in Ireland to qualify for the Fair Deal Scheme.

Under the Fair Deal Scheme, you pay a certain amount towards the cost of your
care and the HSE pays the rest. Fair Deal covers approved [ private nursing
homes, voluntary nursing homes(pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/HSE_Section_40_List_200_Published.pdf)
and [ public nursing homes(pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/Cost_of_Care_in_Public_Nursing_Homes_2024.pdf)
.

If you choose to pay for nursing home care privately, you must pay the full
cost of the private nursing home directly.
