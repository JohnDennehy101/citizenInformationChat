###  PRSI

The Employee's PRSI-Free Allowance of €127 per week (for those paying PRSI
Class A, E and H) and €26 per week (for those paying PRSI Class B, C and D)
will be abolished. (January 2013)

Employees who earn €352 or less per week continue to have no liability to make
a PRSI contribution and are not affected by the abolition of the weekly PRSI-
Free Allowance.

Currently, employees who pay PRSI at Classes B, C and D are exempt from PRSI
on self-employed earned income (from a profession or trade) and any other
unearned income (for example, rental income.) This exemption will be
abolished. All such income will become liable to PRSI at the rate of 4%. (1
January 2013)

Unearned income for everyone else will become subject to PRSI in 2014. This
means that PRSI will be payable on income generated from wealth such as rental
income, investment income, dividends and interest on deposits and savings.
(2014)

The minimum annual PRSI contribution for people with annual self-employed
income over €5,000 will increase from €253 per annum to €500. (2013)

**Voluntary contributions**

The flat-rate voluntary contribution paid by a formerly self-employed person
is being increased from €253 to €500. Former contributors at Classes A, H and
E will continue to pay voluntary contributions at 6.6% but their minimum
payment will increase from €317 to €500. Former contributors at modified rates
continue to pay voluntary contributions at 2.6% but their minimum payment will
increase from €126 to €250 (1 January 2013)
