####  Childcare

A new After-School Childcare Scheme (part of the Children Plus Initiative) for
primary school children will provide childcare to low-income families so that
they can take up employment. It is expected that the scheme will provide over
6,000 childcare places. A pilot scheme will start in early 2013. (See also
‘Children Plus Initiative’ above)

€2.5 million has been provided for a new ‘area-based approach to child
poverty’ initiative to further enhance targeted early-childcare and education
supports for children in a number of disadvantaged areas.

€5 million has been allocated to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs
in 2013 to provide for a number of initiatives including a new capital
programme for Youth Cafes and other youth projects as well as schemes funding
play and recreation and parent and toddler groups.

The new Child and Family Support Agency will be established in 2013. This will
involve moving child welfare and protection services out of the HSE and
creating a new statutory body which will encompass both the National
Educational Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency.
