####  Further Education and Training Scheme

New participants on the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS),
Youthreach and FÁS further education and training programmes who move from
jobseeker’s payments will no longer have their new payments increased to the
maximum €188 per week, if their jobseeker's payment is less than this.
However, people under 25 who were getting an age-related reduced rate of
Jobseeker’s Allowance will get a standard maximum rate of €160 per week. (1
