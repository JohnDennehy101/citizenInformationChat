###  Pensions

There is no change in tax relief on pension contributions in 2013, but from
2014 relief will be limited to pensions of €60,000.

There will be a once-off option to withdraw up to 30% of the value of funded
Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) made to supplement retirement
benefits. Withdrawals will be liable to tax at an individual’s marginal rate.
The option to withdraw will be available for 3 years from the passing of
Finance Bill 2013.
