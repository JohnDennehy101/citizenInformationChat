###  Common law powers

Most of the powers given to the Garda√≠ to stop and question members of the
public are set out in legislation (known as statutory powers). However, there
are a number of instances where a Garda is entitled to stop and question you
where no statutory power exists. This is known as a _common law power_ .

An example of this would be where a Garda observes you acting suspiciously
late at night in an area where a lot of crimes are being committed. The Garda
is entitled to stop you to detect and prevent crime. You are under no legal
obligation to co-operate with the Garda and the Garda cannot use force to
restrain your freedom under common law, short of [ arresting
](/en/justice/arrests/arrests/) you.
