##  Surveillance by Gardaí

The Gardaí regularly use surveillance on people and locations to detect and
prevent crime. Surveillance is used in a number of situations.

If, for example, you are suspected of being involved in criminal activities
you may be placed under surveillance. Similarly, when the Gardaí have
information that a crime is to be committed at a certain location, they may
decide to place that premises or location under surveillance. The decision to
place a person or premises under surveillance is primarily one for the Gardaí
but must be made within the law.
