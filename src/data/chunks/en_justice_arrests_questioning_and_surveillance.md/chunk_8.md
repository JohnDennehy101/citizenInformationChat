###  **Do you have to answer questions when stopped by a Garda?**

There are many laws that allow the Gardaí to stop you for certain purposes.
One law which specifically permits a Garda to stop and question you, short of
arresting you, is [ section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/arrests/questioning-and-
surveillance/#zza13y1939s30) .

Section 30 gives the Gardaí the power to stop you as a suspect in a public
place. It also gives them the power to stop any vehicle, or any ship, boat or
other vessel for the purposes of questioning and searching, and if necessary,
arresting the suspect.
