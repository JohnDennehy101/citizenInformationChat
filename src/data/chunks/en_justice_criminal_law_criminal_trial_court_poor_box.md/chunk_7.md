##  How the court poor box works

There is no set procedure for how the court will handle the process.

Generally, if a judge orders that you make a donation to the court poor box
and you have the funds to pay, the [ Court Registrar
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courtroom/functions-and-
duties-of-individuals-in-a-court-of-law/#97df8e) will collect the payment and
issue you with a receipt.

If you do not have the funds with you but you can afford to pay, then
arrangements will be made for you to pay at a later date.

Donations are forwarded to the relevant charity or organisation by the court.

If you do not have the funds to pay or choose not to make a donation, a
conviction for your offence will be registered against you.
