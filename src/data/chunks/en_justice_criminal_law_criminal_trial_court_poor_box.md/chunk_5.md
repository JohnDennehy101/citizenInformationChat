##  Purpose of the court poor box

The most common reason for using the court poor box is that, in the opinion of
the judge, while the prosecution has proven its case, it is not appropriate to
enter a conviction. For example, because it is a minor or first offence.

Having a conviction registered against you can significantly affect your life
by damaging employment prospects, careers and social relationships. For this
reason, where the court feels that the citizen will not re-offend, the judge
can choose to impose a donation to the court poor box.
