####  **Proposal to abolish the court poor box**

In 2005, the [ Law Reform Commission ](http://www.lawreform.ie/) published
their [ Report on the court poor box: probation of offenders (pdf)
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/Reports/rCourtPoorBox.pdf) . This report
makes recommendations for reforming the court poor box and the Probation of
Offenders Act 1907.

In February 2014, the Department of Justice published the [ General Scheme of
Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1b57f-criminal-justice-community-
sanctions-bill/) . This Bill proposes to abolish the court poor box and
replace it with a statutory Reparation Fund that will apply to minor offences
dealt with by the District Court.
