##  Legal status

There is no legislation guiding the use of court poor boxes. The current
system has evolved over the years from the judge's common law jurisdiction to
exercise their discretion in imposing penalties.

Where an accused makes a payment to the poor box, the judge usually applies
the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 or imposes a suspended sentence.
