##  What happens after I send in my application?

When the local authority receives your application, they will:

  * Review your application to ensure it is complete 
  * Schedule a technician to visit your home to see if it is possible to do the work 
  * Write to you to let you know if your application has been successful and the amount you have been approved for. (The grant will not be paid if you start work before you get grant approval.) 
  * Ask you to send information from the contractor doing the work. This includes a quote for the work and the contractorâ€™s tax reference number. 
  * Ask for the bank account details that the grant will be paid into when the work is completed 

If your application for the grant is unsuccessful, you can appeal the
decision. The appeal must be in writing and clearly explain why you are
appealing. You must make the appeal within 3 weeks of the decision. A local
authority official who was not involved with the original assessment will
assess your appeal and contact you with the result. This could take up to 6
weeks.
