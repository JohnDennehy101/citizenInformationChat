##  What do I need to apply?

To apply for the Housing Aid for Older People Grant you must complete the
application form and provide certain evidence and supporting documents.

You must provide evidence:

  * Of your gross household income for the previous tax year 
  * That the [ Local Property Tax (LPT) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) for your home is in order 
  * That your tax affairs are up-to-date 

You will also need to include further information depending on the type of
repairs you need. If you need:

  * Roof repairs, you should include a letter from your insurance company stating that these repairs are not covered under your policy 
  * To upgrade the electrical wiring in your home, you should include a report from an electrician describing the necessary repairs. This electrician must be registered with Safe Electric. 
  * To replace an existing central heating system, you should include a report from a heating contractor saying that the existing heating system is ‘beyond economic repair’. This means that it is more cost effective to replace the heating system than repair it. 

You do not need any medical documents for this grant, as it is based on the
condition of your home, and how urgently the repairs are needed. However, if
your application is urgent due to a medical condition, your doctor will need
to complete the Doctor’s Certificate section of the application form.
