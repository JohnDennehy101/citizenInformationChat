##  Your right to complain

Online platforms like social media networks, host providers and online
marketplaces have become part of our daily lives.

However, sometimes online platforms can be misused to spread harmful or
illegal media such as hate speech, terrorist content or child sexual abuse
material (CSAM). They can also be abused to sell dangerous goods and
counterfeit products, or to offer illegal services, exposing users to harm.

Since 17 February 2024, you have the right to make a complaint against online
platforms if you:

  * See harmful or illegal content 
  * Need to report a violation of terms 
  * Have concerns about targeted ads 

In most cases, **you should first complain to the platform itself** and then
complain to [ Coimisiún na Meán ](https://www.cnam.ie/) if you believe the
platform has not met its obligations.
