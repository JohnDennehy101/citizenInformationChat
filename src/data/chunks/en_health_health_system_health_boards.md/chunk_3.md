##  New HSE health regions

Starting in 2024, the HSE services will be organised into [ 6 health regions
](https://about.hse.ie/our-work/hse-health-regions/) . Each region will manage
all integrated health services in its area. By the end of 2024, the current
hospital groups and community healthcare services (CHOs) will merge into these
new health regions.

[ The HSE ](https://about.hse.ie/our-work/what-the-hse-does/) will be
responsible for nationally delivered clinical and supporting services and
nationally consistent standards and guidelines.

[ The Department of Health ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-
health/) will be responsible for setting health policy and strategy and
overseeing health funding.

[ The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth
(DCEDIY) ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-children-equality-
disability-integration-and-youth/) will be responsible for policy, legislation
and funding for specialist community-based disability services.

healthcare services below. This page will be updated as the new [ health
regions ](https://about.hse.ie/our-work/hse-health-regions/) come into effect.
