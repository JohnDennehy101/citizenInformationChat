##  Introduction

There are rules on how financial services and credit can be advertised. The
lender providing the credit must make sure that these rules are followed.
Lenders must not publish, display, or submit any advertisement that breaks the
rules.

The [ Central Bank of Ireland monitors advertising
](https://www.centralbank.ie/regulation/consumer-protection/compliance-
monitoring/advertising-monitoring) for the services that it regulates. To
check whether a financial services firm is regulated by the Central Bank, you
