##  Tax relief for landlords

You can deduct the interest on mortgages used to purchase, improve or repair
rented residential property when working out your rental income for tax
purposes.

You must show that you have registered all tenancies in the property with the
[ Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-
disputes/residential-tenancies-board/) . Interest can only be deducted during
the period in which the property is let.

The amount of interest you can deduct on these mortgages has increased in
recent years:

  * Before 2017, it was 75% of the interest 
  * In 2017, it was 80% of the interest 
  * In 2018, it was 85% of the interest 
  * From January 2019, it is 100% of the interest 

Interest is treated as accruing on a daily basis and the date the loan was
taken out is not relevant.
