###  Residential Premises Rental Income Relief

A new tax relief for individual landlords of residential properties was
introduced in 2024. The Residential Premises Rental Income Relief is available
for the years 2024 to 2027.

The relief is available at 20% of rental income profit. The maximum amount of
relief each year is:

  * €600 in 2024 
  * €800 in 2025 
  * €1,000 in 2026 and 2027 

You can claim the relief in your income tax return.

Once you claim the relief, it will be taken back if you dispose of the
property within the following 4 years.
