##  How lenders use your credit record

When you apply for a loan or other credit, the lender can use your credit
history when deciding whether or not to lend to you.

Examples of credit include:

  * Credit cards 
  * Overdrafts 
  * Hire purchase 
  * Personal contract plans (PCPs) 

The information on your credit report can be used to decide:

  * Whether to lend to you 
  * How much to lend you 
  * How much interest to charge 

Lenders may check your credit report when you:

  * Apply for a new loan 
  * Apply to have an existing loan restructured 
  * Have arrears on a loan 
  * Have gone over the limit of a credit card or overdraft 

When you apply for a loan, the lender must check the Central Credit Register
if the loan is for €2,000 or more.

Lenders can also check the Central Credit Register if you apply for a loan
under €2,000 or:

  * You have requested a re-structure of an existing loan 
  * There are arrears on an existing loan or a breach of a limit on a credit card or overdraft 

The [ Credit Reporting Act 2013
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2013/act/45/front/revised/en/html) sets
out the rules for the Central Credit Register.
