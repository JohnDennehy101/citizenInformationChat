##  Introduction

Your credit history is information about your loans. It includes details such
as:

  * The type of loans 
  * The amount the loans were for 
  * The amount remaining 
  * Any missed payments 

This information is listed in a credit report.

Lenders can get a credit report when they are deciding on loan applications.

Credit reports are held by the Central Credit Register (CCR). The Central
Credit Register does not give a credit score or credit rating. Your lender
decides on your loan application based on their own lending policy.

You can request a copy of your own credit report online or apply by post.

If you are applying for an overdraft, mortgage, credit card or other type of
loan, you can check your credit report before you apply. It can help you spot
any missed payments you are not aware of or mistakes in your credit report.

You can get incorrect information corrected. You also have the right to add a
statement to your credit report to explain any special circumstance.

This page outlines how lenders use your credit record, what information is on
it and how you can check it and change it.
