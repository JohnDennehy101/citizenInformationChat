##  Family payments

If you are an EEA or Swiss citizen and working in Ireland, you can claim
family payments if you have dependent children living in Ireland or in another
EEA country or Switzerland.

You can claim [ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/child-benefit/) if you have a child or children under the age of 16.
This is paid regardless of how much money you earn. If your child lives in
another EEA country or Switzerland, Ireland may pay the full rate or a ‘top
up’.

A ‘top ‘up’ can happen when the other parent of the child gets an equivalent
payment from the country they live in, but at a lower rate.
