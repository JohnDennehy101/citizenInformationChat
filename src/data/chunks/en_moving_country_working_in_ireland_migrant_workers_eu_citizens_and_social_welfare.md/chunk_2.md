##  Introduction

You have the right to work in Ireland if you are a citizen of the EU, the EEA
(the EEA includes the EU, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway) and Switzerland.

While you are working, you can claim the same family benefits that are
available to Irish citizens.

If you lose your job, or you stop working because you are sick, you can apply
for a social welfare payment to support you while you are looking for work or
recovering from illness. The Department of Social Protection (DSP) will assess
your application and decide if you qualify for a payment.

You cannot claim a social welfare payment if you have arrived in Ireland to
look for a job. However, you may be able to import your unemployment payment
from another EEA country for a limited time.

The EU has rules on how social welfare is co-ordinated between EEA countries,
including Switzerland.
