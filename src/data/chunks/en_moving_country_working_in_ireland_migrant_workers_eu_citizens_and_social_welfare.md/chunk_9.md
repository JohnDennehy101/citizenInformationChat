###  Sick or incapacitated

If you are sick and unable to work temporarily, you can claim:

  * [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/) \- You must meet the criteria and have enough social insurance contributions. You can use contributions paid in another EEA country or Switzerland before you came to Ireland, but your most recent contribution must have been paid in Ireland. 
  * [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) \- This a means-tested payment. 

If you become incapacitated (that is, you are unable to work permanently) and
have enough social insurance contributions you can claim [ Invalidity Pension
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/) . If you do
not have the contributions to get the full rate of Invalidity Pension, you may
be entitled to a reduced payment if you do not have enough Irish
contributions, but have [ contributions from another EEA country or
Switzerland ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-
social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-abroad/) .
