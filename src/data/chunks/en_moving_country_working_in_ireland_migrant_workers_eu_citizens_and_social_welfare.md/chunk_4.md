###  Payments based on your social insurance

Some social welfare payments are based on your [ social insurance
contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/) (PRSI) from work. If you are an
employee, your employer pays PRSI for you. If you are [ self-employed
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/class-
s-prsi/) , you pay PRSI as part of your yearly tax return.

You can use the contributions you paid in another EEA country to qualify for
these payments, but your most recent social insurance contribution must have
been paid in Ireland.
