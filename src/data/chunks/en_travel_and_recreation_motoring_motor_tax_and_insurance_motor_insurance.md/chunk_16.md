###  Renewing your motor insurance

In most cases, you will need to renew your insurance policy every 12 months.
This can generally be done online, in person or over the phone. Be aware that
premiums frequently change at the point of renewal so it pays to shop around
and get quotes from different companies before renewing your policy with the
same insurer.

Your motor insurance company must issue your insurance renewal notice at least
20 working days before the date of expiry of your insurance policy. Your no
claims discount certificate also be included with the renewal notice. You will
need this certificate if you want to renew your motor insurance with a
different insurance company.

When your insurance is due for renewal, your insurance provider must give you:

  * Details of the premium paid for motor insurance in the previous year 
  * Quotations for all the policy options available to you, such as comprehensive, third party fire and theft, and third party only 
  * Information in Plain English, so that you can make an informed decision
