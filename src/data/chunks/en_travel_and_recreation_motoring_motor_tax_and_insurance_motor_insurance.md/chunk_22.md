The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman deals with complaints and
disputes between policyholders and their insurance companies when the
company's complaints procedure fails to resolve the problem. The Financial
Services and Pensions Ombudsman's decision is binding, if you are unsatisfied
with the decision you may take your case to the High Court.
