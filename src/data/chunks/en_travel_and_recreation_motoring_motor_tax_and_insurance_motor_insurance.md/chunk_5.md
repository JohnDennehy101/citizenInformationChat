###  Third party fire and theft

Third party fire and theft is the most popular type of motor insurance in
Ireland. It provides the same level of cover as third party but with added
cover if your vehicle is stolen or damaged by fire. If you are at fault for an
accident, third party, fire and theft will not cover you for damages to your
vehicle or any injuries that you sustain.
