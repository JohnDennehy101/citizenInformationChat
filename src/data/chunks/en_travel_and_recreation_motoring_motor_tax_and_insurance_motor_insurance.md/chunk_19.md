###  Driving outside the EU

If you drive your car in a non-EU country, you should check with your insurer
to find out about what you need to do to make sure that you are covered in the
relevant jurisdiction.

In some cases, your insurer will issue you with a Green Card. The [ Green Card
system ](https://www.cobx.org/article/4130/green-card-system-final) is a
protection mechanism for victims of cross-border road traffic accidents
consisting of 46 member countries. The Green Card demonstrates to local law
enforcement authorities that you have the minimum compulsory level of
insurance required to drive legally in a participating jurisdiction.

Green Cards are no longer needed for UK registered motor vehicles, including
those from Northern Ireland, travelling to the Republic of Ireland or any
other EU country.
