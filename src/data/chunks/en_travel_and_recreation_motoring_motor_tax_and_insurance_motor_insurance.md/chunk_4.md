###  Third party

Third party insurance is the [ minimum level of motor insurance
](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/666f59-motor-insurance/#compulsory-
motor-insurance) needed in Ireland and [ throughout the European Union (EU)
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/european-
union/) for all vehicles.

If you are involved in an accident and are at fault, third party insurance
will only compensate the other parties involved. This could be for damage to
their vehicle or any injuries that they sustain (including your passengers).
You will not get any compensation for damage to your vehicle or injury to your
person.

Third party insurance provides no cover for loss or damage to your vehicle due
to fire or theft.
