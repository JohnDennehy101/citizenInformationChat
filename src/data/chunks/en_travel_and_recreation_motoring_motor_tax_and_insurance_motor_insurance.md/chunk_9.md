##  Cost of insurance cover

An insurance premium is the monthly or annual payment you make to an insurance
company to keep your policy active.

The cost of your premium is determined by the level of risk an insurer
considers you to pose as a driver. In some cases, an insurer may impose an
extra charge to a standard premium to reflect any additional risk assumed.
This is referred to as a ‘loading’.

You must disclose all relevant information to an insurer when initially buying
or renewing your insurance. Otherwise, the policy you buy may subsequently be
deemed null and void. If you are unsure whether certain facts are relevant,
you should disclose them to the insurer and it is then up to the insurer to
decide.
