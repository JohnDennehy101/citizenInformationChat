###  What is a no-claims bonus and how does it work?

Most insurers offer a premium discount for motorists with a claims free
record: this is referred to as a ‘no claims bonus’ or a ‘no claims discount’.
You are typically awarded a percentage discount on your premium on a sliding
upward scale for each year of claims free driving up to a maximum of 5 years.
The ceiling for a no claims bonus is usually around 60%, leaving someone who
has never had a claim with only 40% to pay.

Your no claims bonus can be transferred from one insurance company to another,
and from one vehicle to another. However, each no claims bonus is specific to
one vehicle at a time; therefore, if you have two vehicles, you will need to
work up a no claims bonus for each vehicle. If you have no insurance in your
own name for 2 or more years, many insurers will not give you your no claims
discount when you reapply for insurance cover.
