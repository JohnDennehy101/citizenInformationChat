###  If you are refused motor insurance

Individual insurers have the right to refuse you cover, but they must provide
you with a reason for the refusal should you ask for one. If you have been
refused cover, you are entitled to go to the [ Declined Cases Committee of
Insurance Ireland ](https://www.insuranceireland.eu/consumer-
information/general-non-life-insurance/declined-cases-agreement) who will get
an insurance quotation for you. In order for the Committee to consider your
case you must first have sought and been refused quotations in writing from at
least 3 insurers.
