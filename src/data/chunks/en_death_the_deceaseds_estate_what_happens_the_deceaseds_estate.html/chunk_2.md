##  Introduction

When a person dies, their property passes to their personal representative.
The personal representative then distributes the deceased's person’s assets
(money, possessions and property) in accordance with the will - if there is
one - or the laws of intestacy if there is no will. These assets are described
as the deceased person’s _estate_ .

Here you can read about the law on what happens to the estate where a person
has left a will, or died without leaving a will (died _intestate_ ).

The personal representative is known as:

  * The _executor_ where there is a will 
  * The _administrator_ where there is no will, no executor appointed in the will, or the executor cannot or will not carry out their duties 

Our document, [ Dealing with the deceased person’s money and possessions
](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/dealing-with-the-deceaseds-estate/) explains
what the personal representative has to do with the estate.

If the person who has died left a valid will, the personal representative will
distribute the deceased person’s assets according to their wishes. You can
read about [ how to make a valid will ](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-
will/) .
