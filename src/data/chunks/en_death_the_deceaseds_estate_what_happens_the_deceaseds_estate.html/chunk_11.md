###  Rights of children under a will

Children do not have any absolute right to inherit any of their parent's
estate if the parent has made a will. Children born inside or outside marriage
and adopted children all have the same rights and there are no age
restrictions.

However, a child can apply to court if they feel that they have not been
provided for. An application must be made within 6 months of the taking out of
a Grant of Representation. The court then has to decide if the parent has
failed in their duty to the child in accordance with the needs of that child.

Each case is considered individually, but it is important to remember that the
legal right share of the spouse cannot be reduced to give the child a greater
share of the estate. It can, however, reduce the entitlement of a civil
partner.
