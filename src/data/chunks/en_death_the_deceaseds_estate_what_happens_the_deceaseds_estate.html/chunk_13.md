##  What happens when there is nowill?

If you die without leaving a will, then your estate will be distributed in
accordance with the law of succession.

This also happens:

  * When the will is not valid because it was not made properly 
  * When a legal challenge to the validity of the will has been successful 

The law of succession also applies to assets which are not covered by a will
such as where there is no residuary clause

The order in which your estate is distributed in these cases is set out in the
[ Succession Act 1965
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0027/index.html) .

If you are survived by:

  * **A spouse or civil partner but no children (or grandchildren)** : your spouse or civil partner gets the entire estate. 
  * **A spouse or civil partner and children** : your spouse/civil partner gets two-thirds of your estate and the remaining one-third is divided equally among your children. If one of your children has died, that share goes to his/her children. 
  * **Children, but no spouse or civil partner** : your estate is divided equally among your children (or their children). 
  * **Parents, but no spouse, civil partner or children** : your estate is divided equally between your parents or given entirely to one parent if only one is living. 
  * **Brothers and sisters only** : your estate is shared equally among them, with the children of a deceased brother or sister taking his/her share. 
  * **Nieces and nephews only** : your estate is divided equally among those surviving. 
  * **Other relatives only** : your estate is divided equally between the nearest equal relations. 
  * **No relatives** : your estate goes to the State.
