###  Young workers

The law prevents children under age 16 from working, except in rare cases, for
example, to work on a film.

Children aged 14 and 15 can do light work but there are rules around working
during school term.

Young people (aged 16 to 18) can have jobs but there are rules about maximum
hours and night work.
