###  **Self-employed**

If you have a _‘contract for services’,_ often called a contractor, you are
self-employed. You normally run your own business and provide services for a
fee over a specific time.

The [ Code of Practice for Determining Employment Status 2021 (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-
employment/documents/code-of-practice-on-employment-status.pdf) sets out
detailed guidelines and criteria to clarify whether a person is an employee or
self-employed. You can read more about [ understanding your employment status
