###  Terminal illness

You can get a medical card if you have a terminal illness and have been told
you have 24 months or less to live.

Your hospital consultant will send a [ Terminal illness medical card
application form (pdf) ](https://www2.hse.ie/file-library/medical-
cards/terminal-illness-emergency-medical-card-application-form-mc1t.pdf) to
the HSE stating that you have a terminal illness and have 24 months or less to
live.

Your medical card number will be active on the system within 24 hours of your
application being processed. You can access medical card services while you
wait for your card in the post.

Your medical card will never be reviewed and it will not expire.
