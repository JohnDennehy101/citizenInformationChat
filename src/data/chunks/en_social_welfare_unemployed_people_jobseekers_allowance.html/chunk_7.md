###  Students

If you have just left school, you cannot get Jobseeker's Allowance. To get
Jobseeker's Allowance you must be at least 18 and be out of school for 3
months. The [ 3 month disqualification rule
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1a5134-operational-guidelines-jobseekers-
allowance/#ja-disqualification-course-of-study) does not apply to Youthreach
participants.

If you are a third-level student studying full-time, you cannot claim the dole
(JA or JB). You cannot sign on outside term-time, such as during the summer
holidays (unless [ you are a mature student
](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Jobseekers-Allowance.aspx#condavailwork) ).
However, once you have finished college permanently you can claim a
jobseeker's payment if you cannot find work. This is also the case if you
leave college without finishing your course.
