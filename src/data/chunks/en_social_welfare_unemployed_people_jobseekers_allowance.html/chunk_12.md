####  **Child dependants**

A _child dependant_ is usually a child up to 18 years of age who lives with
you. The extra payment for a child dependant is called an Increase for a
Qualified Child (IQC).

If you have been getting Jobseekerâ€™s Allowance for at least 156 days and your
child is in full-time education, an IQC will be paid up to 22 years of age or
up to the end of the academic year in which he or she reaches 22.

If you and your partner are both getting a social welfare payment, you will
each get a half-rate IQC.
