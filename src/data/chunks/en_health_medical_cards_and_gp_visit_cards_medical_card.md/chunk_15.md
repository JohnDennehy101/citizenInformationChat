###  Medical cards for people aged 16 to 25, including students

If you are aged 16 to 25 and dependent on a parent or guardian, you are
eligible for a medical card if your parent or guardian has a medical card.

**If you are already included on your family's card** , you will be sent your
own card when you turn 16.

**If you are not already included on your familyâ€™s card** you must send in
your own [ medical card application form (pdf)
](https://assets.hse.ie/media/documents/Medical_Card_and_GP_Visit_Card_Application_Form.pdf)
and your parents or guardians need to apply for you too. Send both
applications together.

This does not apply if their income is above the means test limit and they
have a discretionary medical card.
