###  Medical card expiry date

Your medical card is valid for a set period of time. It has a ‘valid to’ date
on it.

Your card will be reviewed by the HSE periodically. The HSE will write to you
at the address you applied with to check if you still qualify for a medical
card.

They will also review your details to check if you qualify before they renew
your card.
