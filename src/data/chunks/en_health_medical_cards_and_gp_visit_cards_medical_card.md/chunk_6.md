###  Means test

There are different guidelines for the means test depending on whether you are
aged over or under 70. See:

  * [ Means test rules for people **under 70** years of age ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card-means-test-under-70s/)
  * [ Means test rules for people **over 70** years of age ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-cards/medical-card-means-test-over-70s/)

The HSE assessment of a couple for medical cards is based on the age of the
older person.
