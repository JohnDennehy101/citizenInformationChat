##  Appeals, reviews, renewals and managing your medical card

If your circumstances change, you must tell the HSE as you may no longer be
eligible for a medical card. For example, if your income or family
circumstances change, you must inform the Medical Card Unit as soon as
possible â€” their contact details are at the end of this webpage.
