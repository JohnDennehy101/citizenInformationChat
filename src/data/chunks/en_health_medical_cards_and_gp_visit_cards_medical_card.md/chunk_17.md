###  Domiciliary Care Allowance

If you have a child for whom you are getting [ Domiciliary Care Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) , the
child is eligible for a medical card, without a means test.

If the child does not have a medical card or GP visit card, you can [ register
the child for a medical card online ](https://www.sspcrs.ie/portal/free-gp-
care-dca-web/pub) or [ download a registration form (pdf)
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/mc/dca/Final%20Version%20DCA%20Form.pdf)
.

If the child already has a medical card or GP visit card, you do not need to
register; they will be automatically registered for a medical card.
