####  **Your medical card if you move house**

You can use your medical card for up to 3 months if you are living temporarily
in a different area. In this case, you can attend any GP in the area
participating in the medical card scheme.

If you are going to be away longer than 3 months, you do not have to re-apply
for a new Medical Card. However, you must tell the HSE that your address has
changed and you will need to change your GP if you have moved area.

Contact your new [ Local Health Office
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) or check the list of
participating doctors working in your new area.
