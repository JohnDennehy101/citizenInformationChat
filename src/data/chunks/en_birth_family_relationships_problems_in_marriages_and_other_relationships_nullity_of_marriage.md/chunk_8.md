####  Incapable of entering into a marriage

At the time of the marriage ceremony, one of you was incapable of entering
into and sustaining a proper or normal marriage relationship. This may be due
to a psychiatric illness or personality disorder. It may also be due to the
sexual orientation of one of you

If the court decides that your marriage is voidable for any of these reasons,
it will then declare that your marriage was invalid from the start. The
marriage is annulled.
