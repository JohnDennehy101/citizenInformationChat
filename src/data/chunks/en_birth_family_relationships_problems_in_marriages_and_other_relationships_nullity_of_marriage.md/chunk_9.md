##  Consequences of an annulment

Whether your marriage is void or voidable, the legal consequences of a civil
annulment of your marriage are the same. Your marriage is declared to be
invalid from the start. Therefore, your marriage never legally happened.

If you have already remarried, that is, you have married before an order of
annulment was actually made by the court, your new marriage may have appeared
invalid and bigamous. However, once the annulment order is granted, your new
marriage is validated, as your first marriage has now been declared invalid.

If your marriage is annulled, you lose the rights that you had as a married
person. Therefore:

  * The home that you shared with your former spouse is not a [ family home ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/family-and-shared-home/) . If your former partner is the legal owner of the house, they can sell or lease it without you agreeing to it. 
  * Under the [ Succession Act 1965 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0027/index.html) , when a married person dies, their spouse is [ legally entitled to a share of their estate ](/en/birth-family-relationships/married-couples/marital-status-and-inheritance/) whether or not they have left [ a will ](/en/death/before-a-death/making-a-will/) . As your marriage never happened, you do not have any [ succession rights as a spouse ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/succession/) if your former partner dies. 
  * Once your marriage has been annulled, you do not have a right to apply as a spouse or former spouse to the court to order your former partner to pay maintenance to support you. However, if there were children born during the annulled marriage, you may apply to the court to order your former partner to pay [ maintenance ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) . 
  * If your marriage is annulled, it will also have consequences for your children. However, the [ Status of Children Act 1987 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987/en/act/pub/0026/index.html) protects the legal rights of children whose parents are not married to each other. Under the Succession Act 1965, if you die and do not provide for your child adequately in your will, that child may apply to the court for a share of your estate. If you die without a will, your children have an automatic right to a share in your estate. These rights apply equally to children born outside of marriage and children born within marriage, so [ an annulment of your marriage will not affect your children's succession rights ](/en/birth-family-relationships/married-couples/marital-status-and-inheritance/) . 
  * [ The right of a father to be a guardian of his child ](/en/birth-family-relationships/married-couples/guardianship-status-of-fathers/) may be affected by an annulment of marriage. Normally, when a child is born to married parents, both parents are the joint guardians of the child. The father will continue to be regarded as a joint guardian in a nullity if it is a voidable marriage, where the decree of nullity is granted: 
    * after the birth of the child, or 
    * in the 10 months before the birth of the child 

A court can also make orders in relation to the unfitness (or unsuitability)
of one the former partners to have custody in respect of any dependent child.

You can apply to the court to determine any question relating to ownership or
possession of property or assets following a decree of nullity. The court can
then make orders to divide or sell disputed property or assets.
