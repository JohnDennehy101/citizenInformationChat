####  Lack of capacity

At the time of the marriage ceremony there was a lack of capacity. In other
words, you or your spouse was incapable of entering into a binding contract of
marriage. This may happen:

**Lack of consent**

At the time of the marriage, there was a lack of consent. In other words, you
or your spouse did not give free and fully informed consent to the marriage.
This may be due to duress, for example, you were forced into the marriage,
mistake, misrepresentation or fraud. It may also be due to the fact that you
or your spouse was suffering from a mental illness or was intoxicated at the
time of the marriage.

If the court decides that your marriage is void for any of these reasons, it
will make a declaration that your marriage never existed.

**Formal requirements for marriage not followed**

The formal requirements for a marriage ceremony were not followed. For
example, you did not give at least 3 monthsâ€™ notice to the civil registrar of
your intention to marry.

If the court decides that your marriage is void for any of these reasons, it
will make a declaration that your marriage never existed.
