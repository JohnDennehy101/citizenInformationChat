##  What is nullity?

A decree of nullity is a declaration by a court that your marriage never
existed in the eyes of the law. It means that no valid marriage exists between
you and your partner. Nullity is more commonly referred to as an annulment.

Nullity (or annulment) is not the same as divorce. Divorce is a declaration
ending a valid marriage. Nullity is a declaration that a valid marriage never
existed.

There are two types of marriages that may be annulled:

  * Void marriages 
  * Voidable marriages 

If your marriage is void, it is regarded as never having taken place.

If your marriage is voidable, it is considered to be a valid marriage until a
decree of annulment is made. Once the decree is granted, your marriage is also
regarded as never having taken place.

A decree of annulment can only be made if one of the parties of the marriage
applies to the court for a decree of nullity. If the court decides that your
marriage is voidable, it will then declare that your marriage was invalid from
the start. Your marriage never happened.
