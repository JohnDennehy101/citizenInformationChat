###  Advance royalties

If an artist receives advance royalties towards the later publication of a
book or other piece of writing, they must apply for the Artists’ Exemption in
the tax year in which the royalties are paid. When applying for the exemption,
the artist must provide confirmation from the publisher that the book will be
published. A draft copy of the work must also be submitted.

If an application is received in the tax year in which the advance is received
but a decision has not yet been made, any tax due on the advance must be paid.
If the application is later approved, the Inspector of Taxes will review the
artist's liability and make a refund if tax has been overpaid.

Advance royalties that are paid before the year of claim are not exempt from
tax.
