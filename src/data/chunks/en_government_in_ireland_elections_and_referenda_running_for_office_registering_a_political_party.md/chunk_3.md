##  Criteria for registration

To register a political party, you must satisfy the Registrar that your party
is organised to contest elections.

You can register a party’s name and an emblem.

You can register a political party to contest all elections or to contest only
local elections. Different rules apply if you want to register to contest
local elections only.

The [ Register of Political Parties
](https://www.electoralcommission.ie/publications/register-of-political-
parties/) is available online. Anyone can inspect the complete Register of
Political Parties by contacting [ An Coimisiún Toghcháin ](/en/government-in-
ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/electoral-commission/) (the Electoral
Commission).

Candidates from unregistered parties can run in elections, but the party's
name will not appear on the ballot paper.
