##  Registration refusals and appeals

When the Registrar has considered your application for registration, you will
be notified of the decision. If the application is refused, the Registrar will
inform you of the reasons for refusal and details of how to appeal the
decision.

Notices of decisions are published in [ Iris Oifigiúil
](https://www.irisoifigiuil.ie/) (the Irish Government official gazette).

Appeals must be lodged within 21 days of the publication of the decision in
Iris Oifigiúil, to the Chairperson of the Electoral Commission together with a
deposit of €500.

The deposit is returned to the person making the appeal unless the appeal
board decides that the appeal was frivolous (not serious) or vexatious
(intended to cause annoyance).
