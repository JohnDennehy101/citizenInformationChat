###  If the deceased person had COVID-19

The funeral director should, where possible, allow the coffin to remain open.
Their decision is based on the potential risk of infection. To avoid infection
you should not kiss the deceased person.

You should avoid direct contact with the funeral director if you have been in
close contact with the deceased. Instead, try to arrange the funeral details
over the phone or by email. If you find this too difficult, you can ask a
family member to be your spokesperson.

If the bereaved family wants to wash and dress the bereaved person themselves
because this is part of your religious beliefs or customs, the funeral
director can advise you on how to do this safely.
