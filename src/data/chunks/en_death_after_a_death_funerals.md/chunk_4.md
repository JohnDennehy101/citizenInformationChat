###  Practical steps when arranging the funeral

You should contact your preferred funeral director as soon as you can. The
Irish Association of Funeral Directors has published a [ Code of Practice
](https://www.iafd.ie/code-of-practice) that its members must follow when
helping to arrange your loved one's funeral.

Let people know that your loved one has died. Your funeral director can place
a notice on [ rip.ie ](https://rip.ie/) , and you may want to tell your local
newspaper or radio station.

You can read about Government guidance in the Department of Healthâ€™s [ Guide
for the Bereaved
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f43301-covid-19-coronavirus-a-guide-for-
the-bereaved/) .
