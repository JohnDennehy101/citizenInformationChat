##  Introduction

If youâ€™re returning to Ireland, you may want to move your belongings home too.

You can send smaller items by courier or post, but you should tell Revenue
about this in advance.

You will need a shipping container if you are returning with bigger items,
such as furniture or cars. There are many international shipping services
available. Do your research and shop around for the company that best suits
your needs.
