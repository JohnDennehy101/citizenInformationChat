###  **Shipping from another EU country to Ireland**

If youâ€™re shipping your personal belongings from an EU country, you do not
have to pay any extra Value Added Tax (VAT) or customs duty in Ireland. This
is because you already paid VAT and duty in the EU member state where you
bought the goods.

There are some exceptions to this, such as when [ shipping a vehicle home
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/planning-your-
journey-home/bringing-your-vehicle-back-to-ireland/) . You may also have to
pay [ excise duty ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/duties-and-vat/excise-duties/) on items such as alcohol and tobacco.
