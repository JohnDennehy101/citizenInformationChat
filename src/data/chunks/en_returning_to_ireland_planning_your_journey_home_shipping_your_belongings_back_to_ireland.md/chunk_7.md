##  Do I have to pay customs duty or tax?

You may have to pay customs duty, excise duty and [ Value Added Tax (VAT)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/duties-and-
vat/value-added-tax/) on your items.

Customs duty is a tax on the import of goods. It is normally calculated as a
percentage of the goods’ value. For non-commercial goods, valued at €700 or
less, you may get a standard rate of 2.5%.

Excise duty is a tax charged on the import of alcohol and tobacco products.

[ Value Added Tax (VAT) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/duties-and-vat/value-added-tax/) is a tax on the sale of goods and
services. VAT is charged at the point of importation, at the rate you would
have paid if you bought the goods in Ireland. Use Revenue’s [ A-Z database of
VAT rates ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/vat-rates/search-vat-rates/vat-
