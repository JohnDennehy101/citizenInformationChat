####  **Choose a ‘Full Container Load’ or ‘Less than Container Load’**

The shipping company will ask if you want your goods to travel in a ‘Full
Container Load’ (FCL) or a ‘Less than Container Load’ (LCL).

  * FCL means only your goods are in the container 
  * LCL means your goods will travel in a shared container with other people’s belongings 

Make sure to ask the international shipping company what is included in the
quote, such as additional charges for VAT, or shipping insurance.
