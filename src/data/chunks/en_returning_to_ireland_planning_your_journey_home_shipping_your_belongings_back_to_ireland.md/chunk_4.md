###  **How to measure your items in cubic metres**

  1. Measure the length, width and height of your belongings in centimetres 
  2. Multiply the length, width, and height together (L x W x H) 
  3. Divide your total by 1,000,000 

Your answer is the size (also called the ‘volume’ or ‘capacity’) of your
belongings in cubic metres.
