##  How much does it cost to ship belongings to Ireland?

The cost of shipping your belongings to Ireland depends on their size, weight
and shape. It also depends on the distance you are shipping them. You may also
have to pay duties and tax on your items when shipping them home.

To give you a quote, your chosen shipping company will need an estimate of the
size of your goods, in cubic meters or feet.

If something is an irregular shape, try to measure it in small, regular-shaped
parts and then add the parts together. For example, if measuring a chair,
measure the base and the back separately, then add the totals together.
