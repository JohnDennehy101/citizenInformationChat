###  **Moving to Ireland from outside the EU**

If you are shipping from outside the EU, your personal belongings must be
cleared by customs (Revenue). This is the case whether you are shipping
belongings yourself, or using a courier or moving company.

You should email a completed [ transfer of residence form C & E 1076 (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/individuals/customs/c-and-e-1076.pdf) to
Revenue 2 weeks before your goods arrive in Ireland. You can claim relief from
customs duty and VAT by submitting this form.

You don’t need to list individual items of used clothing, toiletries, or
accessories. Instead, these can be grouped together as ‘personal items’. Make
sure to include the current market value of any valuable belongings.

When your form is complete, send it to [ the relevant port or airport
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/customs/individuals/transfer-residence/procedure-
at-importation.aspx) . If you are using an international shipping company,
they may help you with documentation for customs.
