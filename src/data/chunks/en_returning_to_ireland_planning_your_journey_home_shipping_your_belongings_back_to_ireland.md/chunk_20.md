##  Should I insure my items?

As items can be damaged during shipping, it is important to insure your
belongings.

Many shipping companies offer insurance in their packages. If you take out an
insurance policy, check what items are covered and in what circumstances.

If you hire the shipping company to wrap your belongings and pack the
container on your behalf, keep a detailed list of every item you are shipping.
Keep any relevant receipts and sales invoices for the items too.
