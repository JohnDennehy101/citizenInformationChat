####  Applying together with siblings

If you are applying at the same time as your brothers or sisters, you can send
your applications together in one envelope. You can both use the same original
documents for the Irish citizen you are basing your application on. You should
include a letter explaining that you want the documents to be used for both or
all the applications.
