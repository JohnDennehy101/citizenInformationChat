###  **Recycling vapes and e-cigarettes**

Most vapes and e-cigarettes have batteries so they should not be put in your
bin at home. Instead, you should bring them to a Blue Battery Box to be
recycled.

You may also be able to return your vape or e-cigarette to the store where you
bought it.

This recycling service is free and is provided by [ Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Ireland ](https://www.weeeireland.ie/) .

Disposable vapes do not need to be taken apart to be recycled. However, to
recycle rechargeable vapes or e-cigarettes, you need remove the tank where the
liquid is stored before you recycle it.
