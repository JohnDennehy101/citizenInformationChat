###  **What if I want something delivered to my home?**

If you are having an electrical appliance delivered to your home, you can have
the old item collected at the same time for no extra cost.

The retailer cannot charge for collecting the waste equipment, although they
can charge a delivery fee for the new item.

Retailers must give 24 hours’ notice of delivery and you must have the old
item ready to be collected. This means the item must be clean, empty and
disconnected from all electrical, gas or water systems (if appropriate).

If a retailer has not given 24 hours’ notice of delivery and an old appliance
is not ready for collection, they must return to collect it within 15 days.

If you don’t want to use the free collection service when your new equipment
is delivered, you can return your old item to the shop at any time.
