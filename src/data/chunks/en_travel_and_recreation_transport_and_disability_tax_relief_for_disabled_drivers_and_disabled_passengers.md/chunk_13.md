###  Applying for exemption from motor tax

The way you apply for this **motor tax exemption** depends on whether your
vehicle has been registered in Ireland before or not.

**New vehicles exemption from motor tax**

If you have a new vehicle or a vehicle which is being registered in the State
for the first time, you need to complete the RF100 form and give it to your
local Motor Taxation Office. You do not need any documentation from the
Central Repayments Office in Revenue.

New vehicles that are modified may need Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA).
Contact the [ National Standards Authority of Ireland
](https://www.nsai.ie/certification/automotive/national-type-approva/iva/) for
more information.

**Used or second-hand vehicles exemption from motor tax**

If you have a used or second-hand vehicle, you need to apply to Revenue for
the motor tax exemption, see the address below. If the application is
successful you will get a Certificate of Approval.

If your used vehicle was registered outside of Ireland and modified for use
under the scheme, you must have a completed declaration of conversion.

You then need to go to your local Motor Tax Office to tax the vehicle. You
need to bring the following documents with you:

  * Certificate of approval 
  * Change of particulars form RF111 
  * Vehicle Registration Certificate 

The Motor Tax Office will then issue an exempt tax disc, and a replacement
Vehicle Registration Certificate to the registered owner.
