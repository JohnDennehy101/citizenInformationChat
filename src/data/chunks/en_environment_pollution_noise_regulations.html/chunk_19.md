###  **Noise from bird scarers (such as crow bangers)**

Bird scarers are used by farmers to keep birds away from their crops. They can
work by making a loud noise to scare away any birds or pests in the area.

Some bird scarers, such as crow bangers, can be extremely loud. There are no
laws in place to deal with bird scarers specifically.

If you want to complain about the noise from a crow banger, follow the steps
in the [ How to make a noise complaint
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/environment-and-the-
law/noise-regulations/#dd9a0d) section above.
