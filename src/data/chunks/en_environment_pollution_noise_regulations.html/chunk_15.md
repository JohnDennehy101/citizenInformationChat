##  Noise from homes

Domestic noise is noise from a domestic setting, like a home. Depending on the
cause of the noise, you will complain in a different way. This is outlined
below.

If the noise is coming from a person’s home, the Gardaí can ask them to lower
noise but they can’t enter the property with the sole intention of asking them
to lower the noise.

If the noise continues, you can complain to the District Court (see above).
