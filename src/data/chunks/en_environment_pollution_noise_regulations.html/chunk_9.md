###  **Step 2: Contact your local authority or the EPA**

If this doesnâ€™t work, you can contact your local authority or the EPA who may
be able to advise you on how to deal with the noise complaint.

The local authority or the EPA are not likely to get involved in disputes
between neighbours.

But if it is coming from an industrial or commercial source, the EPA or the
local authority may serve a notice to those causing the noise.
