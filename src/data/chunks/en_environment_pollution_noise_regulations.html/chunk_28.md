##  Planning permission and noise complaints

When granting [ planning permission
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/planning-permission/planning-
permission/) for a building, the local authority can include conditions to
prevent or reduce noise. These conditions can relate to the construction or
building phase and/or to the use of the building when it is complete.

You can appeal to [ An Bord Plean√°la
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/planning-permission/an-bord-
pleanala/) against these requirements (or the absence of them).
