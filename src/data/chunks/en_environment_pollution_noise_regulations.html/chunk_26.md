###  **Sites not licenced with the EPA**

If the premise is not licenced with the EPA, you can report it to your local
authority.

Local authorities have similar powers to the EPA and can also serve notices.
This notice requires the person in charge to follow instructions set out in
the notice to prevent or limit noise.

The local authority can prosecute you if you fail to comply with the notice.

Or, it may take steps itself to ensure compliance and then recover the costs
from the person in charge.
