###  **Noise from motor vehicles**

All vehicles with an internal combustion engine must be fitted with a silencer
or a similar device to reduce the noise. This does not apply to vehicles
taking part in a trial, competition or race carried out on a closed road. Read
the [ laws on vehicle noise
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1963/si/190/made/en/print) .

This does not apply to [ electric vehicles ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/buying-or-selling-a-vehicle/electric-vehicles/) , as they
don’t have an internal combustion engine; they have an electric engine.

You can’t drive a vehicle that causes excessive noise in a public place. The [
National Car Test ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/vehicle-standards/national-car-test/) (NCT) assess how effectively
the silencer reduces exhaust-related noise.

**Beeping a car horn**

You should only beep or use a horn to warn other road users of oncoming
danger, or to make them aware of your presence for safety reasons.

You shouldn’t use a horn in a built-up area between 11pm and 7am unless there
is a traffic emergency.

Contact the [ Gardaí ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/law-
enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/) if you wish to complain
about breaches of these rules.

**Car alarms**

No standards have been set in Ireland for the operation of car alarm noise.
The EU standards for car alarms set minimum and maximum time limits for the
sounding of the alarm (25 seconds minimum and 30 seconds maximum).
