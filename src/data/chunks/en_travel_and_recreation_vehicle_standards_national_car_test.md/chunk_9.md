###  Dangerous test result

The vehicle has failed the test because of a dangerous defect that poses a
direct or immediate risk to road safety. The NCTS will put a ‘failed
dangerous’ sticker on your car. It is illegal to drive a vehicle with a
dangerous defect. If you continue driving your car and you get stopped by An
Garda Síochána, you may get penalty points or have to go to court. You must
get the vehicle repaired and re-inspected by NCTS within 30 days. If it passes
the re-inspection, you will get an NCT certificate.
