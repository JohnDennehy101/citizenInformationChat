If your car is 4 years or older, it must take a test. How regularly you repeat
the test depends on the age of your car. You must repeat the test:

  * Every 2 years, if your car is over 4 years old and less than 10 years old 
  * Every year, if your car is over 10 years but less than 30 years old 
  * Every 2 years, if your car is between 30 and 39 years old and you are not using it for commercial purposes 

The person taking the car to the NCT must bring the cars vehicle registration
or licensing certificate to the test centre. They must also bring their
driving licence or [ Public Services Card (PSC) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/public-services-card/) as identification.
