##  Preparing for the NCT test

The NCTS recommends that you prepare for the test by ensuring that:

  * Your car has adequate oil and water 
  * The boot is empty and the seats are clear of personal belongings such as removable baby seats 
  * Your glove compartment is unlocked and clear of personal belongings (allow for OBD testing) 
  * Any devices using the OBD port in the vehicle are removed in advance 
  * The vehicle is reasonably clean (especially the underbody) 
  * The wheel hubcaps are removed and the tyres are inflated to the correct pressure 
  * Seat belts and clips are fully visible 
  * Your [ vehicle registration plates ](/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-standards/vehicle-registration-numbers/) comply with current regulations 
  * The timing belt has been replaced in a diesel vehicle within the timeframe specified by the vehicle manufacturer 
  * Your lights have been checked and set before the test. 

The NCTS has a [ checklist of what to check before your NCT
](https://rsa.ie/en/RSA/Your-Vehicle/Your-Vehicle-/Preparing-for-your-NCT-/)
to help you prepare for your test.

If you get your car serviced before the NCT, the NCTS advises that special
attention is paid to the most common failure points:

  * Headlights: alignment and condition 
  * Suspension and steering 
  * Brakes: front, rear, and hand brake
