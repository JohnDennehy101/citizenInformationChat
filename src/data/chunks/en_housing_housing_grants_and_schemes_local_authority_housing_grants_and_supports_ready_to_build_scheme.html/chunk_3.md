##  Do I qualify for the Ready to Build Scheme?

To qualify for the Ready to Build Scheme, you must meet the following
criteria:

  * You must build a home on the site and live in it as your principal private residence when it is built. 
  * You must build your home on a site that is part of the scheme in a regional town or village, see below. 
  * You must apply for planning permission to build your home on the site within 3 months of being approved to buy the site and paying your deposit. Ownership of the site will only be transferred to you when you get confirmation of planning permission. 
  * You must start building your home on the site within 12 months of getting planning permission. (An extension to this timeframe may be given in exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the local authority). 
  * You must agree to the clawback conditions, which apply if you sell the home within a certain timeframe. 
  * You must not have already bought a site under the scheme. 
  * You must have tax clearance from Revenue to show that your tax affairs are in order. 

**Note:** If you don’t apply for planning permission within the 3-month
timeframe, ownership of the site will go back to the local authority. And, if
you don’t start building your home within 12 months of getting planning
permission, you must repay the local authority the discount you got on the
site.
