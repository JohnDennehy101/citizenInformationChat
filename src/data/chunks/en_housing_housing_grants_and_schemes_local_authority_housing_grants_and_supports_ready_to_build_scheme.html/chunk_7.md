##  How are applications for the Ready to Build Scheme prioritised?

Applications for the Ready to Build Scheme are prioritised in this way:

  1. First-time buyers and ‘fresh start’ applicants 
  2. Applicants with particular needs who are selling or have sold their current home and want to live in a town or village. Particular needs include people with disabilities and older people. 
  3. Anyone else who is selling or has sold their home and wants to live in a town or village. 

You are a first-time buyer if:

  * You have not previously bought or built a property to live in. 
  * You do not own or have an interest in any property in Ireland or abroad. 

You are a ‘fresh start’ applicant if you previously owned a home, but you no
longer have a financial interest in it because:

  * You are now divorced, separated, or your relationship has ended 
  * You have gone through personal insolvency or bankruptcy
