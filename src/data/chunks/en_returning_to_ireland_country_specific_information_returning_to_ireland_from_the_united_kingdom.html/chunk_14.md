####  **Get mortgage approval**

A [ mortgage ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-
home/help-with-buying-a-home/taking-out-a-mortgage/) is a long-term loan
secured against the property you buy. This means if you don’t repay your
mortgage, you may lose your home.

Commercial lenders (banks) offer a range of mortgage rates and products.
Before starting to look for a home, you should check with potential lenders to
get a statement of how much they are prepared to lend you. This is called
_approval in principle_ . Getting approval in principle will indicate what
price range you can consider when looking for somewhere to buy.

Approval in principle doesn’t mean that the lender has approved a mortgage and
agreed to lend you this amount. The official mortgage approval is contained in
a _letter of offer_ , which the lender will only issue when it is fully
satisfied with certain matters, including a valuation of the property you are
buying.

The CCPC has a [ mortgage calculator ](https://www.gov.uk/international-
pension-centre) that shows what your monthly repayments will be depending on:

  * The amount you borrow 
  * How long the mortgage will last 
  * The interest rate
