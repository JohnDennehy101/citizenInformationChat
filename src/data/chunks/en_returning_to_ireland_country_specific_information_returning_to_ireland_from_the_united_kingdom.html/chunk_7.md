##  Getting your UK benefits in Ireland

Many UK benefits, including national insurance pensions, can continue to be
paid to you by the UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) if you move from
the UK to Ireland.

Before you move, you should ask if you can transfer your existing UK benefits
outside the UK.

Contact the [ DWPâ€™s International Pension Centre
](https://www.gov.uk/international-pension-centre) for more information.
