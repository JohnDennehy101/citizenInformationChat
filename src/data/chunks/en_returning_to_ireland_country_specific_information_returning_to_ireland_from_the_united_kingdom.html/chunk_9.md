###  **Transfer a private pension from the UK to Ireland**

You can transfer your UK pension to Ireland if it is listed as a ‘Qualifying
Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme’ (QROPS). Your request for the transfer may
be assessed for tax purposes by the scheme administrator and by the UK’s tax
authorities.

The UK has a [ list of recognised Irish overseas pension schemes
](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-the-recognised-overseas-pension-schemes-
notification-list) .

If the scheme to which you are considering transferring your pension savings
is not a QROPS:

  * Your UK pension scheme may refuse to make the transfer, or 
  * You may have to pay at least 40% tax on the transfer.
