##  Your PPS number and applying for benefits

When you return to Ireland, you will need a [ Personal Public Service (PPS)
number ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/fees-and-supports-for-third-level-education/fees/) to access social
welfare benefits and many public services.

You may already have a PPS number if you:

  * Were born in Ireland from 1971 onwards 
  * Started work in Ireland after 1979 
  * Are getting an Irish social welfare payment 

Regardless of how long you’ve lived in the UK, your old PPS number is still
valid. You don’t need to apply for a new one.

If you [ can’t remember your PPS number
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/applying-for-
social-welfare/pps-numbers-for-returning-irish-emigrants-and-families/#90c63a)
, contact the Department of Social Protection.

If you have never had one before, see which [ documents you need to apply for
a PPS number ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-
ireland/applying-for-social-welfare/pps-numbers-for-returning-irish-emigrants-
