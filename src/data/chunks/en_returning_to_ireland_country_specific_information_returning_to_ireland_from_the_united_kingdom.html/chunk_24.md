###  **Recognition of foreign qualifications**

You should get your foreign academic qualification recognised before applying
for jobs.

National Academic Recognition Information Centres (NARIC) can help you do this
by providing comparisons of foreign academic qualifications based on the Irish
National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).

To compare your qualification:

  1. Search for your foreign qualification on the [ NARIC database ](http://qsearch.qqi.ie/WebPart/Search?searchtype=recognitions)
  2. Download a comparability statement 

The comparability statement will help you, your employer, or education
provider to understand your qualification in relation to the Irish education
system.

If your qualification is not listed on the NARIC database, NARIC may be able
to give you a generic comparability statement for your foreign qualification.

You can apply for recognition advice by [ submitting an online form
