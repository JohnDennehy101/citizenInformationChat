##  What does the Court of Auditors do?

The Court of Auditors audits EU funds and how they are spent. It checks that
funds are raised and used correctly and that EU institutions have accounted
for their spending properly.

It carries out spot checks on EU institutions, EU member states and also
countries that receive EU aid.

It publishes an annual report at the end of each financial year. This is sent
to the other institutions and must be published in the [ Official Journal of
the European Union ](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/oj/direct-access.html) .

It reports suspected fraud, corruption or other illegal activity to the [
European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) ](https://ec.europa.eu/anti-fraud/index_en)
