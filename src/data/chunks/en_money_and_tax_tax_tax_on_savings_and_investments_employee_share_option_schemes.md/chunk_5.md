###  Share options in your employer's company

Revenue-approved savings-related share option schemes allow you to save for
and buy share options in your employer's company tax effectively. You should
check with Revenue and your employer what rules apply to your share options
and when you are liable to pay tax.

You can read more about savings-related share option schemes in [ Revenue's
information on approved shares schemes ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/additional-
incomes/employment-related-shares/revenue-approved-share-schemes/index.aspx)
and in the Revenue [ Tax and Duty Manual on Save as You Earn Schemes (pdf)
](https://revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/share-schemes/chapter-12.pdf) .
