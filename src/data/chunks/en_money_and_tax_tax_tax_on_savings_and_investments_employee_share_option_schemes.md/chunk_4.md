###  Approved Profit-Sharing Schemes

Approved Profit Sharing Schemes allow an employer to give an employee shares
in the company up to a maximum value of â‚¬12,700 per year.

Providing the scheme meets the required conditions, you will pay no income tax
on shares up to the maximum value. The employer must hold the shares for a
period of time (called the "retention period") and you must not dispose of the
shares before 3 years. If you dispose of the shares earlier, you are liable to
pay income tax on the lower of:

  * The market value of the shares when they were given to you or, 
  * The value of the shares at the time of sale 

Approved Profit Sharing Schemes are subject to a number of conditions that
