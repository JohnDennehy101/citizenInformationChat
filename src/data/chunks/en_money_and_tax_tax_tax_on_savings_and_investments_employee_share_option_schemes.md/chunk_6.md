###  Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP)

The Key Employee Engagement Programme allows small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) to use share-based remuneration for key employees. It is
intended to help SMEs compete with larger companies in recruiting and
retaining employees.

When you exercise a qualifying share option under the KEEP programme, any gain
will not be subject to income tax, PRSI or USC. The gain will be subject to
Capital Gains Tax when you dispose of the shares.

This incentive was introduced for qualifying share options granted between 1
January 2018 and 31 December 2023. In Budget 2023, it was announced that the
programme would be extended until 31 December 2025.
