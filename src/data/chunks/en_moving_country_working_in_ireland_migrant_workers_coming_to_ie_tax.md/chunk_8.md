##  Social insurance

Your employer will also deduct social insurance contributions, called [ PRSI
(Pay Related Social Insurance) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/) , from your pay. They
help you to qualify for contributory social welfare payments such as [
Jobseeker's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
benefit/) , [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/illness-benefit/) and [ State Pension (Contributory). ](/en/social-
welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/)

Your contribution depends on your category as an employee. For example, most
employees pay Class A contributions, and how much you pay depends on your
earnings.
