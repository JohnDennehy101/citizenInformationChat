##  Double taxation agreement

If your income is taxable in Ireland and in a country that has a double
taxation agreement with Ireland, you do not pay tax in both countries on the
same income. There is a [ list of the double taxation agreements
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/law/double/double-taxation-
agreements.html) on revenue.ie.

Double taxation agreements usually work by either:

  * Exempting the income from tax in one of the countries, or 
  * Allowing credit in one country for the tax paid in the other country on the same income. 

The exact treatment of your income will depend on the details of the
agreement, the nature and source of your income and, in some cases, on your
nationality or citizenship.
