###  Private water supplies (groundwater)

If you are not part of a water supply scheme (public or group), you will have
to consider boring your own well and drawing out groundwater to supply your
needs. The Institute of Geologists of Ireland (IGI) has prepared [ guidelines
for drilling private wells ](http://igi.ie/publications/guidelines/) .

When the well is drilled, you should seal it against pollution, make sure it
is disinfected and get a sample tested. See the IGIâ€™s [ guidelines on Water
well construction (pdf) ](http://www.igi.ie/assets/files/Water Well
Guidelines/Guidelines.pdf) for further details. If your water supply has been
polluted by negligence, you should contact your local authority. It can
prosecute those responsible under the [ Local Government (Water Pollution Act)
1977 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1977/en/act/pub/0001/index.html) .
