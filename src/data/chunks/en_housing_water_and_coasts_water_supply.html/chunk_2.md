##  Introduction

Irish Water is responsible for the efficient supply of water to homes and
businesses. Funding for maintaining and improving the water supply
infrastructure (pipes, filtration and disinfection systems) comes from the
Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The sector is regulated
by the [ Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) ](https://www.cru.ie/) .

Irish Water is currently implementing a 7-year business plan entitled [

brought into effect under the [ Water Services Act 2013
