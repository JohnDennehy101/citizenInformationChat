##  Water conservation

The Water Services Act 2007 provides for the conservation of water where
leakage occurs due to unrepaired pipes or equipment, or where poor management
results in wastage or excessive consumption of water. Irish water are
currently operating a [ Leakage Reduction Programme
](https://www.water.ie/projects-plans/national-projects/leakage-reduction-
programme/) to improve the pipe network across the country.

[ Regulations made under the Water Services Act (pdf)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/act/29/enacted/en/print.html) also
apply to water restrictions in times of water shortages. Irish Water can make
an order to stop or restrict the use of water supplies for:

  * Watering gardens, recreational parks or sports grounds 
  * Washing cars and trailers (including by commercial car wash facilities) 
  * Filling or replenishing swimming pools, ponds and lakes 
  * Irrigating or spraying crops. 

It is an offence not to comply with a water conservation order.
