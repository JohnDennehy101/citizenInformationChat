###  Grants for group water schemes

Grants are available from the local authority if 2 or more householders get
together to provide their homes and farms with a water system where none
exists. A committee that represents the scheme members must propose the scheme
and the local authority must approve it. The amount of grant payable depends
on where the scheme is located. Check with your local authority for details of
your area. Generally, a grant will cover 85% of the cost, with a limit of
€7,650 for each house in the scheme. The group members must cover the balance,
but costs can be kept down if members can do some of the work themselves.

An annual subsidy is available for the running costs of the group water
scheme. This must be approved by the local authority. The subsidy is:

  * Up to €115 for each house supplied from a from a public source (Irish Water) 
  * Up to €231 for each house supplied from a private source (such as a private well, lake or borehole) 
  * The cost per house where water disinfection and treatment is provided under a Design Build Operate (DBO) contract 
  * Up to €100 per house for schemes of less than 100 houses, that agree to work towards an amalgamation or strategy that results in them forming a new entity
