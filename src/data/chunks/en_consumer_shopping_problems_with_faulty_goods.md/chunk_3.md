##  If something goes wrong

If things go wrong, it is always the seller who should put things right. The
seller must resolve any issue, so the product meets what was agreed in the
contract. Read more about what you can expect when you buy goods in a [ shop
](/en/consumer/shopping/rights-when-buying-in-a-shop/) and [ online
](/en/consumer/shopping/shopping-online/) .

If there is an issue with the product, you can either:

  * Ask for the product to be repaired or replaced 
  * End the contract and get a refund 
  * Ask for a price reduction 
  * Withhold a proportionate amount of any outstanding payment 

In most cases, you can decide which of the _remedies_ above you would prefer.

If the fault appears within the first 12 months, it is automatically assumed
the fault was there when you bought it. This means you do not have to prove
anything.

You have 6 years to use your right to the remedies outlined above.
