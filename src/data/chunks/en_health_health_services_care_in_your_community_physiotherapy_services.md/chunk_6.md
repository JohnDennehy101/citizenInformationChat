##  Physiotherapy in your community from the HSE

The HSE may have physiotherapy services in your community, but this is not
available in all areas. You can contact your [ local health centre or clinic
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) to check if there is
community physiotherapy in your area.

Your local health office may also provide physiotherapy in your home if you
have a disability.
