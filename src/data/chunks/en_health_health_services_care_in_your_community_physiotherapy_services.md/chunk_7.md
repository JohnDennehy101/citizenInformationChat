##  How to apply for physiotherapy through the HSE

You need a referral from your family doctor (GP), [ public health nurse
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-
community/public-health-nurses/) or hospital to get physiotherapy as a public
patient.

Contact your [ Local Health Office
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) or health centre for more
information on the availability of physiotherapy services in your area.

You can also refer yourself to a physiotherapist.
