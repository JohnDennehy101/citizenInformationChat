####  **If you were getting certain other payments**

Your BTEA will continue to be paid during the summer if:

  * You were getting [ One-Parent Family Payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) , [ Jobseeker's Transitional payment ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-transitional-payment/) , or a disability payment before going back to education, **and**
  * You are returning to an approved course and are progressing in your education 

If you work during the summer, your means from work are assessed using the
rules that apply to the original payment.

If you stop work or your work pattern changes, you should [ tell your local
Intreo Centre ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-
offices/) so your case can be reassessed.
