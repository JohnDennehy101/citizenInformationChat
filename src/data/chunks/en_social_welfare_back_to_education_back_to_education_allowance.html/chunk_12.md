  * [ Illness Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/) for **2 years or more** (however, periods spent on Illness Benefit can count towards the qualifying period if you qualify from another payment â€“ half of the qualifying period must relate to the qualifying payment) 

You must re-establish your entitlement to a qualifying payment at the
beginning of each academic year so that you can continue getting BTEA during
the year. If you are no longer entitled to a qualifying payment, your BTEA
will end.
