###  **Keeping your extra benefits**

If you qualify for the Back to Education Allowance, you can keep your
entitlement to any extra benefits you already have (for example, [ Fuel
Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/extra-social-
welfare-benefits/fuel-allowance/) or [ Rent Supplement
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/rent-supplement/) ).

However, any increase in income may affect your entitlement to Rent Supplement
or the amount of supplement you get. For example, this can happen if you have
additional income from part-time work.
