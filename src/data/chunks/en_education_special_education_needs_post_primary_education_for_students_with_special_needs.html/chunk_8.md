](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2005/act/14/enacted/en/html) provides for
an Assessment of Need to identify your child's health needs and what health
services are needed to meet these needs. It is an assessment carried out by
the HSE for children or young people with a disability.

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) must nominate a person to
carry out an assessment of education needs on behalf of the HSE when an
Assessment of Need is in process. Find out more about the [ Assessment of Need
