##  Mainstream schools

Post-primary students with special educational needs may attend a mainstream
post-primary school. They may be in mainstream classes with the support of a
special education teacher and/or the care support of a special needs assistant
or may be in a special class.

A school may apply for a grant to make the school accessible for a student
with a disability, for example, to put in a ramp or accessible toilet
accommodation. Information about this provision can be obtained from the
Building Unit of the Department of Education â€“ see 'How to apply' below.
