####  What happens after mediation?

If you come to an agreement, the mediator will give you and the respondent a
written agreement to sign, followed by a 10-day cooling off period. If both
parties are still happy after the 10-day period, the Injuries Resolution Board
will issue a legally binding _Order to Pay_ (see 'Compensation amounts'
below).

If no agreement is reached, you can have your claim assessed by the Board if
the respondent consents. If they donâ€™t consent to the assessment, you can take
the case to court (see 'Taking a case to court' below).
