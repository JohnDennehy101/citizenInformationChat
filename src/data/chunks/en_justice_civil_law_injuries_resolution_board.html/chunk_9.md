###  **Time limits for making an application**

Under the [ Civil Liabilities and Courts Act 2004
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0031/index.html) , the time
limit for claims for compensation is 2 years from the date of the accident.

It is very important that you notify the person you hold responsible for your
injury (the respondent) within one month of the accident. You should notify
them in writing (by registered post) detailing what they have done. This gives
the person, company or organisation a chance to investigate your claim.

If you do not inform the other person, it may affect your case later if you go
to court, and you may not be able to recover your costs.
