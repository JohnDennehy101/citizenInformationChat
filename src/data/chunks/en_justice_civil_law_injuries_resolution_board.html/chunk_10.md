###  **Respondent disagrees with** **Injuries Resolution Board assessing
case**

When the Injuries Resolution Board receives your claim, it will give you an
application number. It will then inform the respondent about your claim. The
respondent has 90 days to agree to let the Injuries Resolution Board assess
your claim.

If the respondent agrees to this, they must pay a fee (see ‘Fees for Injuries
Resolution Board’ below).

If the respondent does not agree to this, the Injuries Resolution Board will
issue you with an _Authorisation_ . This is a legal document that allows you
to take your claim through the courts if you wish.
