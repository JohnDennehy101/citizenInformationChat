##  Compensation amounts

The guideline amounts for compensation for particular injuries are set out in
the [ Injuries Guidelines (pdf)
](https://judicialcouncil.ie/assets/uploads/documents/Personal%20Injuries%20Guidelines.pdf)
. The Injuries Resolution Board can depart from the Injuries Guidelines but
must explain its reasons for doing so.
