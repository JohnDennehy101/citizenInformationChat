####  **Claimant accepts or rejects the award**

When the Injuries Resolution Board makes its assessment, you have 28 days to
decide whether to accept or reject the award.

If you accept it, you must acknowledge this in writing to the Injuries
Resolution Board.

If you do not reply within 28 days, it is taken that you have **rejected** the
assessment.
