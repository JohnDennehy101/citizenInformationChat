##  How are claims assessed?

When assessing claims and the damages which may be due to you, the Injuries
Resolution Board considers:

  * The medical report from your doctor 
  * A report from an independent doctor appointed by the Injuries Resolution Board, if necessary 
  * The injuries you sustained and your circumstances 

The Injuries Resolution Board is not required to assess certain claims and, in
those cases, it will grant you an authorisation to bring legal proceedings.
The Injuries Resolution Board previously did not make assessments in claims
for psychological injuries, but it now does.
