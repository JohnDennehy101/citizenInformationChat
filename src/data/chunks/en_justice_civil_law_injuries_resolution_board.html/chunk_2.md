##  The Injuries Resolution Board

The Injuries Resolution Board, previously known as the Personal Injuries
Assessment Board (PIAB), is an independent statutory body that deals with
personal injury claims. All personal injury claims in Ireland, except for
medical negligence claims, must be submitted to the Injuries Resolution Board.

The Injuries Resolution Board provides an independent assessment of personal
injury claims for compensation following road traffic, workplace or public
liability accidents.

If the person you hold responsible for your injury (the respondent) does not
want the Injuries Resolution Board to assess your claim for compensation, you
can take your claim to court.

Most claims are assessed in 9 months from when the respondent agreed for the
claim to be assessed by the Injuries Resolution Board.
