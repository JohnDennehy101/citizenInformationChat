###  Cross-examination

After the examination in chief, the solicitor or barrister for the other side
will stand up and ask you a series of questions. This is called the cross-
examination. The purpose of the cross-examination is to allow the other side
to attempt to undermine or reduce the significance of your evidence.

You may be asked questions that are designed to make you seem unreliable,
mistaken, confused or untruthful as a witness. Contradictions in your evidence
may be pointed out to you, and you may be asked to explain those
contradictions. During the cross-examination, you may be asked leading
questions.
