###  Leaving Certificate Applied and the CAO

Students with the Leaving Certificate Applied cannot gain direct entry through
the [ Central Applications Office (CAO) system ](/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/application-procedures-and-entry-requirements/)
to the universities or institutes of technology.

Many PLC courses lead to either a level 5 or level 6 award. In some cases, you
can progress with this award to a third level course in a higher education
institution such as an institute of technology or a university. You should
discuss your options for progression with your course provider.
