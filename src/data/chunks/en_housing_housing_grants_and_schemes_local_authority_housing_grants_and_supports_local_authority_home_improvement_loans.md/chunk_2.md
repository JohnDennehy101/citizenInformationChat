##  What are local authority home improvement loans?

You may be able to get a local authority home improvement loan if you want to
improve, repair or extend your home and can't get a loan from a bank or
building society. You must own and live in the home to qualify for the loan.
These loans are only available from some local authorities, so you should
contact your [ local authority ](https://www.housing.gov.ie/local-
government/administration/local-authorities/local-authorities) to check if the
scheme operates in your area.
