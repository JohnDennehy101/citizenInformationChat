###  Moving from Illness Benefit to Invalidity Pension

If you have been getting Illness Benefit for 468 days, the DSP will medically
assess you to find out if you still qualify for Illness Benefit and if you may
meet the medical criteria for Invalidity Pension. Following this assessment,
you may be sent an IP application form (INV2).

This does not stop you from applying for Invalidity Pension in the normal way
using application form (INV1).

You can get help to fill in your form from your [ local Citizens Information
Centre ](http://centres.citizensinformation.ie/) , Intreo Centre or Social
Welfare Branch Office.
