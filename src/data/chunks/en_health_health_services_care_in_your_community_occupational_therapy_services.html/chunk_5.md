##  Where do I find an occupational therapist?

Many occupational therapists work in [ Health Service Executive (HSE)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/health-service-
executive/) in [ Local Health Offices
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO) or Primary Care Teams.

You may have to join a waiting list to see an occupational therapist and
applications are prioritised according to the need of patients locally.

You can check [ this directory of occupational therapists
](https://www.aoti.ie/) in private practice from the Association of
Occupational Therapists of Ireland.

[ CORU ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
system/registration-of-health-and-social-care-professionals/) is the regulator
and has a [ register of occupational therapists in public and private
healthcare services ](https://system.coru.ie/index.php/SearchMember/Find)
