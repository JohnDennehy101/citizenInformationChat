####  Value Added Tax (VAT)

You must [ register for Value Added Tax (VAT)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/vat-registration/index.aspx) if your annual
turnover is more than, or is likely to be more than, a certain amount. The [
VAT registration threshold ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/vat-
registration/who-should-register-for-vat/vat-thresholds.aspx) depends on
whether you are supplying services or goods and how they are supplied.

As a trader you pay [ VAT on goods and services
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/vat/guide/general.html) acquired for the
business and charge VAT on goods and services supplied by the business. The
difference between the VAT charged by you and the VAT you were charged must be
paid to Revenue. If the amount of VAT paid by you exceeds the VAT charged by
you, Revenue will repay the excess. This ensures that VAT is paid by the
ultimate customer and not by the business.

Revenue has information on [ how to account for and pay VAT
