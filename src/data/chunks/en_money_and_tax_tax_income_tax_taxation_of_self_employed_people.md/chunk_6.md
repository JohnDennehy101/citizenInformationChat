##  Self-assessment

If you are self-employed you should [ register for self-assessment
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-employment/guide-to-self-
assessment/register-it-self-assessment.aspx) . You can [ read more about who
is required to self-assess ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-to-comply-
with-your-tax-obligations#l88efd) .

You (or an agent) must make your income tax return and self-assess your tax
liability for the previous year. You can:

  * File your Form 11 using the Revenue Online Service (ROS). [ Certain people **must** e-file using ROS ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-business/registering-for-tax/mandatory-electronic-payment-of-taxes-and-filing-of-tax-returns.aspx) . 
  * Fill out a paper [ Form 11 (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-employment/documents/form11.pdf) and send to Revenue 

If you have registered for self-assessment since 2015, you are required to
file and pay online.

Revenue has further information and video guides on [ filing your tax return
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-employment/filing-your-
tax-return/index.aspx) .

Revenue also provides [ A Guide to Completing Pay and File Tax Returns (pdf).
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/leaflets/guide-pay-file.pdf)

If you use ROS to make your tax return online, it will calculate your self-
assessment based on the information you provide. You can choose to accept this
calculation or input your own self-assessment.

If you use the paper Form 11, it includes a self-assessment section which you
(or your agent) must complete and sign. If you file the paper tax return
early, before 31 August, Revenue will complete the self-assessment section on
your behalf.
