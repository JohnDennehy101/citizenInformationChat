##  COVID-19 measures

**Debt warehousing**

Some unpaid tax debt arising from the COVID-19 pandemic could be deferred or
_warehoused_ .

Debts that were warehoused are subject to 0% interest for the [ warehoused
period ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-business/paying-your-tax/debt-
warehousing/warehouse-periods.aspx) . After the period ends, a phased payment
arrangement is agreed and interest of 3% applies from this time.

You can get more information in Revenue’s [ Information Booklet on Warehousing
of Tax Debts (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/communications/documents/debt-
warehousing-reduced-interest-measures.pdf) .

**Income tax loss relief for self-employed**

A temporary income tax relief was introduced for self-employed people who were
profitable in 2019 but who made a loss in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Self-employed people could have their 2020 losses (and certain unused capital
allowances) carried back and deducted from their profits for 2019, to reduce
the amount of income tax on those profits. The maximum that could be carried
back was €25,000.

Revenue has a [ guide to the tax relief for self-employed people and how to
apply (pdf) ](https://revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-
gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-12/12-01-03.pdf) .
