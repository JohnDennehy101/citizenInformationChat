##  How much is the Christmas Bonus?

In 2023, the Christmas Bonus is 100% of your normal weekly payment (including
the [ Living Alone Increase ](/en/social-welfare/extra-social-welfare-
benefits/living-alone-allowance/) , the [ Island Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/extra-social-welfare-benefits/island-increase/) and the Over-80
Increase).

If an Increase for a Qualified Adult is paid directly to your dependent
spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, the Christmas Bonus is also paid directly
to them.

If you are getting 2 eligible social welfare payments (for example, a One-
Parent Family Payment and the Domiciliary Care Allowance or a half-rate
Carerâ€™s Allowance as well as your primary payment) you will get the Christmas
Bonus for both payments.

For Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA), which is paid monthly, the bonus is 100%
of the **weekly** DCA rate. The DCA portion of the bonus is calculated
independently of other payments.
