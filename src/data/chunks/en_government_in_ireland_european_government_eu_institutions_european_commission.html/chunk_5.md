###  What do commissioner do?

Commissioners are given a portfolio which is their area of responsibility. It
is up to the President of the Commission to decide which commissioner will be
responsible for each policy area/portfolio and to change these
responsibilities (if necessary) during the Commission's term of office.
Commissioners act independently in the interests of the EU. They do not
represent the interests of their own Member State.

Each commissioner appoints a _cabinet_ of his/her own choice headed by the
_chef de cabinet_ . The cabinet consists of a small group of counsellors
(usually about five) who assist them in the preparation of Commission
decisions.

As well as the cabinets, the Commission's personnel is organised into
specialist departments called Directorates General which are in turn divided
into Directorates and then into Units.

At the head of each department, there is a Director General responsible to the
relevant commissioner.
