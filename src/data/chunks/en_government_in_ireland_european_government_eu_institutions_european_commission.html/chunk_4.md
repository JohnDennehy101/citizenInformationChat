##  The role of commissioners

After each European election, the European Council proposes a president of the
Commission. This nominee must be approved by a majority of the Parliament.

The commissioners are then nominated and they too must be approved by the
Parliament. The Government of each Member State nominates a commissioner. Each
individual commissioner is subject to scrutiny by the relevant committee of
the European Parliament before the vote by Parliament takes place.

The [ current Commission
](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024_en) will be in
office from 2019 to 2024. The President of the Commission is appointed for a
renewable 5 year term.
