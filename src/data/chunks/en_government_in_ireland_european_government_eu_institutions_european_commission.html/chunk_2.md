##  Introduction

The European Commission is the executive of the [ European Union
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/european-
union/) . This means that it is responsible for initiating laws, enforcing the
laws of the EU and managing the EUâ€™s policies.

It is made up of 27 commissioners (one from each member state) and is based in
Brussels. Each member state nominates a commissioner, but the nominated
candidates must be approved by the European Parliament. The Parliament must
also approve the President of the European Commission.

The current President of the European Commission is Ursula von der Leyen.

Commissioners do not represent their countries. Instead, they have a field of
responsibility. [ You can read a list of current Commissioners.

To assist the commissioners in the performance of their duties, there is a
staff of about 32,000 people employed by the Commission. This staff comes from
all of the Member States and includes policy officers, translators, lawyers
and researchers.
