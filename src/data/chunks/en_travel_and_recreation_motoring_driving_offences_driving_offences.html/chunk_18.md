##  Fitness to drive

It is an offence to drive in public if you know that you are medically unfit
to do so.

Drivers who are 75 years or over and drivers who have [ certain medical
conditions ](https://www.ndls.ie/medical-reports.html#specified-diseases-and-
disabilities-which-need-to-be-reported-on-application-for-or-renewal-of-a-
driver-licence) must have a fitness to drive certificate signed by their GP.
In some cases, a GP may decide that you are unfit to drive, or the NDLS may
decide that you are unfit to drive. If this is the case, you will be refused a
licence. You can appeal this decision.

You can get more information about fitness to drive from the [ Road Safety
Authority ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/licensed-drivers/medical-fitness) .
