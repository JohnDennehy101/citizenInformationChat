##  Introduction

If you break a rule of the road, you may commit a driving offence. Driving
offences in Ireland are set out in the [ Road Traffic Acts 1961 (as amended)
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1961/act/24/front/revised/en/html) .

Driving offences have different penalties, which depend on the seriousness of
the offence, and sometimes, on how many offences you have committed in the
past.

Driving offences have different penalties, which depend on the seriousness of
the offence, and sometimes, on how many offences you have committed in the
past.

Penalties range from fixed charges, which are fines that you must pay, to
imprisonment for the most serious offences. If you are sent a fixed charge
notice and you fail to pay the charge on time, you will be summoned to appear
in court.

Ireland also uses a [ penalty points ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-points-for-driving-offences/)
system for driving offences.

Gardaí have the power to arrest you for some driving offences, such as drink
driving or dangerous driving.

You will also be [ disqualified from driving ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-offences/being-disqualified-from-driving/) if you
commit an offence and a judge decides to disqualify you from driving, or if
you have [ 12 penalty points on your licence ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-points-for-driving-offences/) .

**New Garda roadside technology**

Since 24 May 2024, the Gardaí have mobility devices to do a roadside [ check
if a vehicle is insured ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/2827c-minister-
mcentee-and-minister-richmond-attend-launch-of-irish-motor-insurance-
database/) on the Irish Motor Insurance Database. The Gardaí can also check if
a vehicle is taxed or if the driver is disqualified, using mobility devices at
the roadside.
