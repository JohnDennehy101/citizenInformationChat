###  Insurance

You must have motor insurance to drive a car in your own name or as a named
driver on someone else's policy. If a Garda asks for your insurance
certificate, you must provide it within 7 days. Offences for driving without
insurance are prosecuted in court. Failure to display an insurance disk
carries an initial fixed charge of €60 (rising to €90 after 28 days).

If you drive while uninsured, you could be fined up to €5000 and get 5 penalty
points. You could also go to prison for up to 6 months. The judge may decide
to disqualify you from driving instead of giving you penalty points. You can
