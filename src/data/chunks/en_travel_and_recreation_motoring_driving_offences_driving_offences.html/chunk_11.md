###  Careless driving

It is an offence to [ drive in a public place without due care and attention
](https://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1961_0024.htm#SEC52)
. If a Garda believes that you have driven carelessly, but no accident
resulted, the Garda can issue you with 2 penalty points and an €80 fixed
charge for “driving without reasonable consideration”. This rises to €120 if
not paid within 28 days. If you are convicted in court, you could be fined a
higher amount and will get 4 penalty points.

There are a number of other offences based on disobeying road signs, or acting
carelessly, and these mainly attract penalty points and fixed charge notices.
Examples include failure to yield, breaking traffic lights, and failing to
stop at a junction. You can read a [ full list of penalty points offences on

offences) .

If the offence is more serious, you could be convicted of careless driving and
fined up to €5000. If you are convicted of **careless driving causing death or
serious bodily harm** , you could be fined up to €10,000 and imprisoned for up
to 2 years, or both.
