###  Learner and novice drivers

If you hold a [ learner permit ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-
licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-work-vehicles/) , you must be
accompanied by a driver who has had a full driving licence for at least the
last 2 years. If you drive unaccompanied, you are committing an offence. This
offence carries an initial €160 fine and 2 penalty points. If you do not pay
the fine within 28 days, the fine increases first to €240. If you do not pay
the fine and are summoned to court, you could be fined even more and get 4
penalty points.

The Gardaí have the power to [ seize the car you are driving
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1994/act/7/section/41/revised/en/html) ,
even if it belongs to someone else. If you allow a learner driver to drive
your car unaccompanied, you could be fined up to €1000.

If you are a [ learner motorcyclist ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-
work-vehicles/) , you do not have to be accompanied at all times. But you
cannot drive your motorcycle unaccompanied until you have completed your
Initial Basic Training.

All learner drivers (except in category W, which includes motorcycles) must
display ‘L’ plates. When you have passed your driving test, you must display
an ‘N’ plate for 2 years. Failure to properly display the L or N plate is an
offence. You could get 2 penalty points and an initial fixed charge fine of
€120, which increases to €180 if not paid within 28 days. If you are convicted
in court, you could be fined a higher amount and will get 4 penalty points.
