###  What happens if I am driving on a foreign licence in Ireland?

Penalty points and other penalties work the same way if you are driving on a
foreign driving licence. See our page on [ penalty points for driving offences
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-points-for-
driving-offences/) for more information.

If you are driving in Ireland on a UK licence and you are disqualified from
driving in Ireland, you may also be disqualified from driving in the UK. See
‘What happens if I commit a driving offence abroad?’ above for more
information.
