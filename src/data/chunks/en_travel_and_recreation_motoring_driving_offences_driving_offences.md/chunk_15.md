to other people. You can get 3 penalty points and a fixed charge fine of €80
for this offence. If you do not pay within 28 days, the fine increases to
€120. If convicted in court, you could receive a fine of up to €2500 for a
first offence, or up to €4000 if it is not your first offence under this law.

You can avoid going to court by paying €160 (twice the sum of the original
fine) no later than 7 days before the court date specified in the summons.

It is an offence to park in a disabled parking bay unless you have a disabled
parking badge. The penalty for this offence is a fixed charge fine of €150
(increasing to €225 if you do not pay within 28 days). Some city and county
councils clamp vehicles that are parked illegally in disabled parking bays.

Since 1 January 2023, the fixed charge amount for misusing a disabled parking
badge is €200 (increasing to €300 if you do not pay within 28 days).

The fixed charge amount for illegally parking in an electric charging bay is
€80.

A system of [ parking restrictions and fines ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/traffic-and-parking/parking-fines-and-vehicle-clamping/) is also in
place throughout Ireland.
