##  Can I appeal against a motoring penalty?

How you appeal against a decision to penalise you for a motor offence depends
on the type of penalty you have received.

**Penalty points and fixed charge notices**

If you have been issued with a fixed charge notice (with penalty points or
not) you can apply to the Garda√≠ for the charge to be cancelled. You must show
that there are good procedural or exceptional grounds for cancelling the
charge. You can get more information on appeals against penalty points and
fixed charge notices in our page on [ penalty points for driving offences
](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-offences/penalty-points-for-
driving-offences/) .

**Appealing a court conviction**

If you choose not to pay a fixed charge notice within 56 days, you are issued
with a summons to appear in the District Court. Some motor offences can only
be prosecuted in court (for example, driving without insurance and dangerous
driving). The most serious motor offences are heard in the Circuit Court, for
example dangerous driving causing death.

If you are convicted of a motor offence in the District Court, you can appeal
the decision to the Circuit Court. This includes appealing against a decision
to disqualify you from driving by the District Court. You should get legal
advice if you are planning an appeal. You can get free legal advice from [
Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC) ](https://www.flac.ie/help/centres/) .

You must lodge an appeal within 14 days of your conviction. If you want to
represent yourself, you can ask the court clerk in your local District Court
for help with the forms you need to complete. Alternatively, a solicitor can
help you.
