##  Speeding offences

It is an offence to [ drive over the speed limit
](https://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1961_0024.htm#SEC47)
. Our page on [ speed limits in Ireland ](/en/travel-and-recreation/roads-and-
safety/road-traffic-speed-limits-in-ireland/) describes the different speed
limits in operation.

If you drive over the speed limit, you will get 3 penalty points and a fixed
charge fine of €160. If you do not pay the fine within 28 days, it increases
to €240. If you do not pay this within 28 days (56 days from the original fine
notification date), you will be summonsed to court where, if convicted, you
could be fined up to €1000 and receive up to 5 penalty points.

You can avoid going to court by paying €320 (twice the sum of the original
fine) no later than 7 days before the court date specified in the summons.
