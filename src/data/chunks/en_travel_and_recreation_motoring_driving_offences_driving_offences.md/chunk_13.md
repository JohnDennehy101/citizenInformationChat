##  Using your mobile phone while driving

It is an offence to hold a mobile phone in your hand, or to support it with
another part of your body (for example, between your head and shoulder), while
driving. The only exception is if you are calling emergency services on 999 or
112.

It is an offence to access information on your phone while you are driving,
even if your phone is secured into a hands-free system. You can legally talk
on your phone using a hands-free system, but the Road Safety Authority advises
very strongly against this.

The penalty for using your phone while driving is a fixed charge of €120, and
3 penalty points. This increases to a fixed charge of €180 after 28 days, and
5 penalty points and a more significant fine can be imposed if it goes to
court because of non-payment.
