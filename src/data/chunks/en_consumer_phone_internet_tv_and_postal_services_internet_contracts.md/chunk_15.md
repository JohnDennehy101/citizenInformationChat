###  You signed up by phone or online

You can cancel the contract if you signed up less than 14 days ago over the
phone or online. This is called a [ ‘cooling-off’ period
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/shopping/shopping-online/) .
If you’ve already used the service, you are likely to be charged for what you
have used.

If you cancel outside of the cooling off period, you may be charged a penalty
fee or pay off the rest of your contract. Check the terms and conditions of
your contract.
