###  Signing up

Once you have picked a plan, you can sign up by:

  * Giving your consent over the phone and having that conservation recorded 
  * Signing a customer authorisation form 
  * Filling in an online customer authorisation form 

Check if your new service provider will contract your old service provider to
start the change-over and if there is anything else you need to do to help
with this.
