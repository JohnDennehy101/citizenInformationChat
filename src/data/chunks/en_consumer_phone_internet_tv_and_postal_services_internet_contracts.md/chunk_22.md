###  **Monitor your usage**

Make sure you know how to monitor your usage. You can ask your provider to
notify you when you reach the limit of your bundle.

Some service providers provide you with alerts when you reach your package
limit without you having to ask for this. Some service providers only do this
if you ask. You should check this, so that you avoid bill shock.

Most service providers will try to notify you if your data downloads are
likely to result in very high bills. You should check this with your service
provider.
