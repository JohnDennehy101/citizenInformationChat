###  Home-school

You have a right to educate your child at home, rather than send them to
school. If you choose home-schooling and your child is 6 or older, you must [
apply for registration from the Alternative Education Assessment &
Registration Service ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/family-community-
support/alternative-education-assessment-and-registration-service/home-
education/) (AEARS) in Tusla. The AEARS regulates education outside of public
schools.

You do not need a formal teaching qualification to home-school your child and
you don’t need to follow the national curriculum. However, you must give your
child a ‘certain minimum education’.

See our page ‘ [ Teaching your child at home
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/the-irish-education-
system/home-education/) ’ for more information.
