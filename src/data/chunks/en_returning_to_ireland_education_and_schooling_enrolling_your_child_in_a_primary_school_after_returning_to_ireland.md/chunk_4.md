schools are not free. Check with the school directly for details of their fees
and curriculum.

Private schools are also called independent schools. If you send your child to
an independent school, you must [ register with the Alternative Education
Assessment & Registration Service (AEARS)

education-assessment-and-registration-service/independent-schools/) in Tusla.
The AEARS regulates education outside of public schools.
