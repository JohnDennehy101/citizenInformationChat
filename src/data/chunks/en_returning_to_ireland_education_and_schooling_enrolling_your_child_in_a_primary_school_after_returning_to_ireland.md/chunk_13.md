##  Step 6: Give additional documents to the school

The school might request documents from you to determine what class to put
your child in, or what level of support they need. They may ask for:

  * Copies of report cards 
  * Relevant assessments and reports of special educational needs 
  * A list of current textbooks and course outlines 
  * Results of standardised tests 
  * Examples or copies of your childâ€™s latest classroom work 

The school also might request your child's immunisation records. This is so
your child can be included in the [ School Immunisation Programme
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/schoolprog/) .
