##  Step 5: Accept an offer

The school must reply to you in writing, to let you know whether your child
has been accepted or placed on a waiting list.

If you get an offer from the school, you must formally accept it. Schools
usually have a deadline by which you must accept their offer.

After you accept a place for your child, you may be asked to sign a
declaration to state that you accept the school’s behaviour policy, and that
you will ensure your child complies with the policy.

If the school refuses your application to enrol your child, see ‘how to appeal
the decision’ below.
