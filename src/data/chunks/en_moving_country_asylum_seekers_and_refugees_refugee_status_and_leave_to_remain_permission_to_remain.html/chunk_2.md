##  Introduction

When you [ apply for international protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/applying-for-refugee-
status-in-ireland/) , the International Protection Office (IPO) must decide if
you qualify for [ refugee status ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-
refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-
introduction#lad40a) or [ subsidiary protection ](/en/moving-country/asylum-
seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/refugees-asylum-seekers-
introduction#l50016) status. The IPO makes a recommendation, which it gives to
the Minister for Justice.

If the IPO recommends that you should not be granted refugee or subsidiary
protection status, the Minister must then decide if you should be granted
permission to remain. You can appeal the IPO recommendation

You don’t make a separate application for permission to remain. You must
provide information about your personal situation when you apply for
international protection. The Minister makes a decision based on this
information. You can send extra information if your situation changes.

The Minister’s power to grant permission to remain as part of the
international protection process is set out in [ Section 49 of the
International Protection Act 2015
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/section/49/enacted/en/html)
