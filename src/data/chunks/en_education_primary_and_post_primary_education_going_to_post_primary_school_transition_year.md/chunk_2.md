##  What is Transition Year (TY)?

Transition Year (also called TY) is a one-year programme between Junior Cycle
and Senior Cycle. It is designed to act as a bridge between the two by helping
the transition or change from the more  dependent  learning of the Junior
Cycle to the more  independent  self-directed learning required for the Senior
Cycle

All second-level schools have the option of offering the Transition Year
programme to their students and most of them do offer it.

The Transition Year programme follows the [ Junior Cycle
](/en/education/state-examinations/junior-cycle-exam-and-results/) and is
generally seen as the first year of a 3-year [ Senior Cycle
](/en/education/primary-and-post-primary-education/going-to-post-primary-
school/senior-cycle/) programme. However, Transition Year is not the first
year of the [ Leaving Certificate programme ](/en/education/state-
examinations/leaving-certificate/) , which is a 2-year cycle.
