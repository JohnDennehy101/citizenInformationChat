##  TY assessment and certification

There is no end-of-year state examination in the Transition Year. This is to
ensure that the focus of the year is learning-led rather than exam-driven.

The activity-based learning ethos of the year requires each school to engage
in school-based assessment, which helps students to identify their own
strengths and weaknesses, as well as develop the skills of self-assessment and
reflection.

Assessment is ongoing, with portfolio assessment, project work, and
exhibitions of students' work. Oral aural, practical and written activities
all form part of this assessment process.

Evaluation of work experience or community service activities can involve the
providers or hosts of the activities.

Students who have successfully completed the Transition Year Progamme are
usually awarded a certificate of participation by their school.
