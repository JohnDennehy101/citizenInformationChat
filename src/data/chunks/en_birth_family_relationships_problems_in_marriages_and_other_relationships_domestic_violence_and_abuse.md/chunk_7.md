##  Are you concerned about someone you know?

You can take some basic steps to help and support a friend, family member,
colleague, neighbour or anyone who confides in you that they are experiencing
domestic abuse. You can offer emotional support and you can offer practical
support.

**Emotional support**

  * Listen, try to understand and be careful not to blame them. Nothing they do or say can justify the abuser's behaviour. 
  * Tell them they are not alone and that there are supports available if they need them. 
  * Support them as a friend. Encourage them to express their feelings, whatever they are. 
  * Don't tell them to leave the relationship if they are not ready to do this. This is their decision. 

**Practical support**

  * Tell them about the support services available (see ‘Support organisations and services’ below). 
  * Give them mobile phone credit if they need it so they can make calls in case of emergency. 
  * Ask if they have suffered physical harm. If so, offer to go with them to a hospital or to see their GP. Suggest that it might be useful in future to have records of any injuries as abuse frequently escalates over time. 
  * Help them to report the assault to the police if they want to. 
  * Go with them to visit a solicitor if they are ready to take this step. 
  * Agree a code word with them which they can use if they are in danger and need help. 
  * Offer the use of your address and/or telephone number to leave information and messages, and tell them you can look after an emergency bag for them, if they want that. 
  * Give them a small amount of money to put away in case they need to get a taxi or bus in an emergency to leave the house and go to family or a refuge. 

Remember to look after yourself while you are supporting someone through such
a difficult and emotional time. Ensure that you do not put yourself into a
dangerous situation; for example, do not offer to talk to the abuser about
their behaviour or let yourself be seen by the abuser as a threat to their
relationship.
