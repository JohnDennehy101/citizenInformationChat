##  Types of abuse

An abusive relationship is where one person uses abuse to control and have
power over their partner in an intimate relationship. Types of abuse include:

  * Physical abuse 
  * Emotional abuse 
  * Online abuse 
  * Sexual abuse 
  * Economic (financial) abuse 
  * Digital abuse 

Coercive control is another type of abusive behaviour. This is when a
boyfriend or girlfriend, partner, husband or wife, or ex uses an ongoing
pattern of controlling, coercive and threatening behaviours to trap the person
in a relationship. A person experiencing coercive control may also change
their routines and lose contact with family and friends. Coercive control can
make it impossible or even dangerous to leave an abusive relationship.
