##  What is domestic abuse?

If a partner or an ex makes you feel scared, controlled or intimidated, you
may be experiencing domestic abuse. There are many different forms of abuse.
It can be physical or it can be emotional, and it may have impacts that can or
cannot be seen by other people.

Abuse can happen to anyone at any age and in any type of relationship. It can
happen to adults and it can happen to teenagers. You don't have to be married
or living with your partner for them to act abusively towards you.
