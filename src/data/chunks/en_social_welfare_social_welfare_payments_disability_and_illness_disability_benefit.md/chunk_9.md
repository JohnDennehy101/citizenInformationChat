###  A review of your entitlement to Illness Benefit

Your Illness Benefit claim will be reviewed from time to time and you may be
asked to attend for a [ medical assessment
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/23858a-operational-guidelines-medical-
assessments/) . The assessment is carried out by a Medical Assessor - this is
a doctor employed by the Department of Social Protection.

The Medical Assessor will give their opinion on whether you are fit for work.
You must attend for a medical assessment when asked, or your Illness Benefit
will be suspended.

If your Illness Benefit is stopped, you have a right to [ appeal the decision
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-welfare-appeals/) . If
you are getting credited contributions only and these are stopped, you can
seek a review of the decision, but you do not have a right to appeal it.
