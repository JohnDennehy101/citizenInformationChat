if you move from a long-term disability payment (see list below) to a job, you
can keep your entitlement to Free Travel for a period of 5 years, provided you
have registered for a [ Public Services Card ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/public-services-card/) .

  * Invalidity Pension 
  * Partial Capacity Benefit (from Invalidity Pension) 
  * Disablement Benefit paid along with Incapacity Supplement
