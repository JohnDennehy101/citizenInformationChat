###  How much will I get paid during parent’s leave?

If you have enough PRSI contributions, you will get a weekly [ Parent’s
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/parents-benefit/) of €274
per week. This is paid by the Department of Social Protection (DSP). Your
employer does not have to pay you while you are on parent’s leave. However,
some employers do pay or _top up_ your pay during the leave period – this is
set out in your contract of employment.
