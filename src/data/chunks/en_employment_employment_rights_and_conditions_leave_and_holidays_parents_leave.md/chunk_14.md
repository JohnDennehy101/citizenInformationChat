###  How to make a complaint?

You are protected against [ penalisation ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/victimisation-at-work/) and [ unfair dismissal
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) for
claiming your rights under parentâ€™s leave legislation.

Disputes about parental leave can be referred by the employee or the employer
to the Workplace Relations Commission within 6 months of the dispute or
complaint occurring.

You must use the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/complaints_disputes/refer_a_dispute_make_a_complaint/)
available on workplacerelations.ie. The time limit may be extended for up to a
further 6 months, but only if there is a reasonable cause which prevented the
complaint from being brought within the normal time limit.
