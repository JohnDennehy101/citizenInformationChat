##  Introduction

Parent’s leave entitles each parent to 9 weeks’ leave during the first 2 years
of a child’s life, or in the case of adoption, within 2 years of the placement
of the child with the family.

The leave period remains the same in the case of multiple births, for example
if you have twins or if you adopt 2 or more children at the same time.

Parent’s leave is available to both employees and people who are self-
employed.

You may also qualify for a payment called Parent’s Benefit during parent’s
leave. [ Parent’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/parents-
benefit/) is paid while you are on parent’s leave from work if you have enough
social insurance (PRSI) contributions.

Please note that your employer does not have to pay you while you are on
parent’s leave, although some employers may ‘top-up’ your parent’s leave. If
you qualify for [ Parent’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/parents-benefit/) , you will get €274 each week.
