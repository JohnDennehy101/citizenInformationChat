refurbishing or converting residential or commercial properties in specified
cities has been extended until 31 December 2022.

€59 million is provided to deliver up to 12,000 **grants to adapt the homes of
older people** and people with a disability.

Funding of €40 million is provided to **support the remediation of homes**
