##  What is bullying?

Bullying is unwanted negative behaviour (verbal, psychological, or physical),
conducted by an individual or group against another person (or persons), and
which is repeated over time.

If someone posts a once-off offensive or hurtful public message, image, or
statement on a social network site (or another public forum) where that
message, image, or statement can be viewed or repeated by other people, this
is also bullying behaviour.
