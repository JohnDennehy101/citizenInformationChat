###  **Making a complaint**

Whether your child is in primary school or post-primary school, you can get
information on [ how to make a complaint about bullying
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/cb6966-anti-bullying-procedures-for-
primary-and-post-primary-schools/) from the Department of Education. However,
the Department of Education itself does not have any power to investigate
complaints.

The Department’s [ anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary
schools (pdf) ](https://s3-eu-
west-1.amazonaws.com/govieassets/24429/3b6f3db2de154ebaa1f69a0856c97c8e.pdf)
are expected [ to be updated in 2024 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-
release/e831f-minister-foley-announces-new-anti-bullying-initiatives-for-
schools/) .

The updated procedures will:

  * Include guidance on when bullying becomes a child protection concern 
  * Ensure proper oversight at school-level 
  * Make sure that schools’ anti-bullying policies are developed in consultation with whole school communities.
