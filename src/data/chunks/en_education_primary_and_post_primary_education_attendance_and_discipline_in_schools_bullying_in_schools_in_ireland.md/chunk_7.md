##  What can I do if my child is a bully?

If you think your child might be a bully, it is important to recognise this
and help them to deal with it. You should talk to the class teacher about this
bullying behaviour and how it could be changed.

If you are told that your child might be bullying somebody, it is important to
react appropriately. Try not to immediately dismiss the allegation, nor
immediately punish your child.

Instead, you should establish the facts of what happened and, if bullying has
occurred, work with the teacher to:

  * Show your child the consequences of their actions, and 
  * Hold them accountable for their behaviour.
