As part of this strategy, [ new anti-bullying modules
](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/e831f-minister-foley-announces-new-anti-
bullying-initiatives-for-schools/) will be taught in primary and post-primary
schools from September 2024. These modules include a first-year resource to
support students moving from primary to post-primary education.

The modules will build on the existing [ FUSE programme
](https://antibullyingcentre.ie/fuse/) , which is currently taught in primary
and post-primary schools, and which covers:

  * Noticing and reporting bullying, and 
  * Dealing with cyberbullying and online conflict.
