](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2022/6/) was signed into law. It
aims to improve online safety for children.

The Online Safety Commissioner (OSC) is part of Coimisiún na Meán. The OSC
will regulate online services and will have enforcement powers to deal with
disputes.

The Code will:

  * Establish important rules that online platforms (like social media) will have to follow 
  * Make sure platforms are responsible for protecting the safety of their users 
  * Impose severe fines (up to €20 million) on platforms that do not meet these safety requirements
