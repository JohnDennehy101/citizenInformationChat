##  Can I get a social welfare payment during the deferral period?

If you defer claiming your State Pension (Contributory) up to the age of 70,
and you meet the other qualifying conditions for the payment, you can get:

  * [ Illness Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/)
  * [ Partial Capacity Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/partial-capacity-benefit/) (only if you came to PCB from Illness Benefit) 
  * [ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/)
  * [ Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit-self-employed/)
  * [ Back to Work Family Dividend ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/back-to-work-family-dividend/)

If you are already getting one of these payments when you defer your pension,
you can continue getting it for as long as you’re entitled to it.
