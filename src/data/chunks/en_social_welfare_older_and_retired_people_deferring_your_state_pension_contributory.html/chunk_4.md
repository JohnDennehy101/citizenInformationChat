##  Who can defer their State Pension (Contributory)?

If you were born on or after 1 January 1958, you can choose to claim the State
Pension (Contributory) anytime between the ages of 66 and 70.

Once you start claiming your State Pension (Contributory), you can no longer
choose to defer your pension claim, even if you keep working. This is because
you donâ€™t pay PRSI once you start getting your pension.
