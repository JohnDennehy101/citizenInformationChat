###  Tenancy warning for rent arrears

You can get a tenancy warning for breaking your rent-related obligations. For
example, not paying the rent agreed in the tenancy agreement or repayments
agreed in a rescheduling arrangement.

The tenancy warning must:

  * Set out the rent-related obligation that has been breached, the amount of arrears now owing and the period when the rent was not paid 
  * Require the tenant to pay the arrears immediately or, in case of hardship, contact the local authority to discuss rescheduling the payments 
  * Warn the tenant that the local authority may start repossession proceedings if the arrears are not paid or rescheduled within 2 months 
  * Warn the tenant that, even if the rent arrears are paid or rescheduled within 2 months, the local authority may start repossession proceedings (without a further tenancy warning) if the tenant misses a payment in the next 12 months, unless a further rescheduling is arranged 
  * Set out the legal provisions about rent arrears that have not been rescheduled 
  * Set out the tenantâ€™s right to request a review of the tenancy warning 

If the local authority knows that the tenant has other debts as well as the
rent arrears, the tenancy warning must also include information on sources of
advice on [ problem debt ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/dealing-
with-debt/) .

The detail about this is set-out in [ Section 8 of the Housing (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 2014
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/21/section/8/enacted/en/html#sec8)
