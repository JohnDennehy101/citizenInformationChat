###  Who reviews the tenancy warning and how long does the review take?

The review must be carried out by a local authority official who was not
involved in the initial warning and who is more senior than the official who
issued the warning.

The reviewer should complete the review within 20 working days of being
appointed. However, if the review involves meeting the tenant or a household
member, or if a change to the warning is suggested, this may take up to 30
working days.

The reviewer can decide to:

  * Confirm the tenancy warning 
  * Change its terms (after giving the tenant a chance for feedback) 
  * Cancel the tenancy warning 

The local authority must send the tenant a written copy of the decision.

In the case of intimidation, the reviewer can accept a statement by a Garda or
a local authority official as evidence that a person has engaged in anti-
social behaviour.
