###  Repossession of abandoned properties

In certain circumstances, a local authority can enter an abandoned property
that is at risk of damage or trespass. The local authority can do this either
with the tenantâ€™s consent or with a warrant from the District Court. However,
if the property has been vandalised or is at imminent risk of damage, the
local authority can enter it to do whatever is necessary, without getting a
warrant.

If a local authority plans to repossess an abandoned property, it must give
the tenant 4 weeks to confirm if they intend to occupy it again. After 4
weeks, the local authority can serve a notice on the tenant, ending the
tenancy. They can then take possession of the property without any further
proceedings. The former tenant may apply to the District Court for the
termination to be reconsidered. The tenant has 6 months to do this.

This is set-out in [ Section 14 of the Act
