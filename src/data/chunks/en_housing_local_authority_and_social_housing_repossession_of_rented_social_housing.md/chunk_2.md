##  Can the local authority repossess my home?

Your local authority can only repossess your rented local authority home for
certain reasons and they must follow set procedures when doing it. These
procedures apply if the local authority wants to repossess a home because:

  * There has been a serious or repeated breach of a condition of the tenancy agreement, for example, [ anti-social behaviour ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/anti-social-behaviour-and-rent-arrears-in-social-housing/#6e8c1a) or [ not paying the rent ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/anti-social-behaviour-and-rent-arrears-in-social-housing/#4b78a9)
  * The property has been abandoned by the tenant and a squatter is living there 
  * The tenant has died and the property is occupied by someone who is not entitled to [ succeed to the tenancy ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-housing/buying-or-inheriting-a-local-authority-home/#95205e)
