##  Who is considered my employer?

Your employer depends on the specific employment rights you want to enforce.

In most cases (exceptions mentioned below), **the party who pays your wages**
is typically considered your employer. This can be either the employment
agency or the client company.

The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 clarifies that agency
workers are insurably employed and the person who pays the wages is the
employer for [ PRSI (pay-related social insurance) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-insurance/)
purposes.

**Exceptions**

In cases involving [ unfair dismissal
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) legislation and compliance with [
health and safety
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/health-and-safety/health-safety-work/) requirements, your employer
is the person or organisation for whom you actually work, rather than the
agency.
