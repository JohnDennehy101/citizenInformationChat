##  Introduction

Agency workers, also known as _temporary agency workers_ have an agreement
with an agency to work for someone else.

For example, a secretary might work for an employment agency and temporarily
do work for an office while one of their employees is on leave.

While agency workers do not have all the same employment rights as permanent
workers they do have the right to equal treatment in basic working and
employment conditions.
