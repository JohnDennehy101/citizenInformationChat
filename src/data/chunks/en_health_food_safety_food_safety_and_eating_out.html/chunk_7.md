###  Enforcement powers

If the authorised officer finds that a premises or a practice (such as food
handling or preparation) is likely to be a risk to public health, they may
give the owner an **improvement notice** . This includes:

  * The cause of the risk to public health 
  * The remedial action that needs to be taken 
  * The time limit for the owner to take remedial action 

If the owner does not carry out the improvements as recommended by the
authorised officer, the FSAI or HSE may seek an **improvement order** from the
[ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) . An improvement
order outlines what needs to be improved upon, and the timeframe within which
the owner needs to do it.

If there is an immediate danger to public health, the authorised officer may
issue a **closure order** . This means the owner must close the business until
the issue has been resolved. A closure order may also be issued if an
improvement order is not acted on. [ Closure and prohibition orders
](https://www.fsai.ie/consumer-advice/closure-orders) are listed on the FSAI
website.
