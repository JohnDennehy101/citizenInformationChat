####  **Example**

You were made redundant in 2020 after **20 years' service** and received a
lump sum of **€100,000** which is your first lump sum.

You also received a lump sum of **€20,000** from your approved pension scheme.

Your pay for the last **3 years** before the date of leaving work was
**€180,000** .

The amount of the lump sum which is exempt from tax is the higher of the
following 2 calculations:

  1. The **Basic Exemption** is:   
€10,160 + €15,300 ( €765 x 20 years) = €25,460  
There is no Increased Exemption as the pension scheme lump sum of €20,000 is
greater than €10,000 limit

  2. The **Standard Capital Superannuation Benefit (SCSB)** is:   
€180,000 ÷ 3 x 20 ÷ 15 - €20,000 = €60,000

The taxable amount of your lump sum is €40,000 (€100,000 - €60,000).

As the above example shows the SCSB tax relief of €60,000 is a higher amount
of tax relief than the Basic and Increased Exemptions of €25,460.
