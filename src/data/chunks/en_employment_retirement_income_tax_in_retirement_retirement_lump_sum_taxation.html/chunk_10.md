##  What rate of tax applies?

A certain amount of your redundancy payment is tax free, as described above.
The balance, known as the taxable lump sum payment, is treated as part of your
total income and is taxed accordingly. This is taxed as part of your current
year's income.

The amount of your lump sum that is subject to tax is not subject to [ social
insurance (PRSI) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) , but you may have to pay the [ Universal
Social Charge ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) .
