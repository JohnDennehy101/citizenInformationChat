###  **Electric vehicle grants for heavy duty vehicles**

If your business wants to buy zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles (ZEHDVs), you
may qualify for a grant. The Zero-Emission Heavy Duty Vehicle Purchase Grant
Scheme offers grants to help companies buy ZEHDVs instead of diesel vehicles.
The grant amount is calculated as a percentage of the price difference between
the ZEHDV and a diesel version.

The amount of grant you get depends on the vehicle type, the size of your
company and whether you have received previous grants under the scheme. The
maximum amount of funding available is â‚¬500,000.

To apply, complete the application form and submit it by email to [
zehdvgrant@pierse.ie ](mailto:zehdvgrant@pierse.ie) . More information,
including the scheme rules and calculation examples, is available on the [
Transport Infrastructure Ireland website ](https://www.tii.ie/en/roads-
