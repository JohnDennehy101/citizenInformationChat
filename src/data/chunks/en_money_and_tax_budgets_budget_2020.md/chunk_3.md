##  Brexit preparations

€200 million is allocated to continue ongoing preparations for Brexit.

In the event of the United Kingdom exiting the European Union without a deal
(a “no-deal Brexit”), the Government plans to provide additional funding:

  * €365 million in Social Protection spending related to unemployment 
  * €45 million to support people to return to employment 
  * €650 million to support the most affected regions and sectors – agriculture, enterprise and tourism 

The €650 million will be provided in a number of stages. The first amount of
€220 million will be made available immediately and divided equally between
agriculture and enterprise supports. €40 million will be used to support
tourism and the use of the remainder will be decided at a later stage.
