###  Brexit-related supports for business

**Short-Time Work Support Scheme**

The Department of Social Protection will provide an opportunity for employers
to retain skilled labour in a reduced capacity and avoid permanent lay-offs
and associated redundancy costs.

**No-deal Brexit**

€110 million will be used to provide grants, loans and investment to firms
that are vulnerable but viable in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The focus
will be on the most exposed sectors, including food, manufacturing and
internationally traded services.

The measures include:

  * A €45 million **Transition Fund** for firms with 10 or more employees in manufacturing or international traded services 
  * A €42 million **Rescue and Restructuring Fund** for firms with liquidity or insolvency problems 
  * An €8 million **Transformation Fund** for larger firms, with €5 million for food businesses and €3 million for other businesses 
  * €5 million additional funding for **Micro Finance Ireland (MFI)** to loan to firms with less than 10 employees (or self-employed people) 
  * €5 million for a **Micro Enterprises Emergency Brexit Fund** , which Local Enterprise Offices will use to provide repayable grants to complement MFI support 
  * €2 million additional funding for **Intertrade Ireland** to support cross-border firms 
  * €3 million additional funding for **regulatory bodies**
