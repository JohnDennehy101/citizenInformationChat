##  Rules for those under 18 years of age

If you are under 18 years of age, you cannot be questioned unless a parent or
guardian is present, except in exceptional circumstances. You have a right to
consult a solicitor before you are interviewed.

If it is not possible to get the parent or guardian you requested to come to
the interview, the member in charge of the station must try to arrange for
your other parent, another guardian, an adult relative or some other
responsible adult other than a Garda to attend.

The member in charge may exclude your parent or guardian from the interview
if:

  * Your parent or guardian is the victim of the offence being investigated 
  * Your parent or guardian has been arrested in relation to the offence or is a suspect 
  * The member in charge has reasonable grounds for believing that your parent or guardian would obstruct the course of justice if they were at the interview.
