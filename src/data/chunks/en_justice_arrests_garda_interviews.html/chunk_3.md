##  Your rights during a Garda interview

You have a right to consult a [ solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/)
before you are interviewed.

Before you are interviewed, the Garda conducting the interview will identify
themselves, and any other Garda in the room, by name and rank.

The interview must be conducted in a fair and humane manner.

No more than two Gardaí can question you at any one time and no more than four
Gardaí can be in the room at any one time during the interview.

If an interview has lasted for four hours, it must either be ended or
adjourned for a reasonable time.

As far as possible, interviews will take place in rooms set aside for
interviews only.

You may not be questioned between midnight and 8 a.m. in relation to an
offence, unless you were brought to the station during that time, or in
exceptional circumstances.

If you are deaf or there is doubt about your hearing ability, you cannot be
questioned without an interpreter, if one is reasonably available, unless you
give your written consent. If you have requested an interpreter and one is not
reasonably available, any questions will be put to you in writing.

If you are drunk or under the influence of drugs so that you are unable to
understand the significance of questions put to you or your answers, you
cannot be questioned while you are in that condition except in exceptional
circumstances

If, while you are being interviewed, you make a complaint to a Garda in
relation to your treatment while in custody, the Garda must notify the member
in charge of the station, if they are not present at the interview, and record
it.
