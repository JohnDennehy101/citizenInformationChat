###  Your solicitorâ€™s role

If your [ solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) is present at your
interview, they will sit with you and they may intervene during questioning.
This may be to:

  * Seek clarification 
  * Challenge an improper question 
  * Advise you not to answer a question 
  * Request the interview be suspended so they can advise you 

They cannot stop you from answering questions or tell you what to say. You can
choose not to answer questions and instead provide a prepared statement.
