##  How does the Council of the European Union make decisions?

The Council uses _[ qualified majority voting
](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/qualified-
majority/) _ (QMV). This means that in order to have a decision passed by the
Council:

  * At least 55% of the member states must agree **and**
  * The member states in agreement must represent at least 65% of the EU population 

To block the proposal at least 4 member states representing at least 35% of
the population of the EU must vote against it.

Certain sensitive topics, such as foreign policy and taxation, require a
unanimous vote (all member states must be in agreement) to pass.
