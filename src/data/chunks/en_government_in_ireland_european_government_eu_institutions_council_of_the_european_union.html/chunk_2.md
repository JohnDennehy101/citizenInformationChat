##  Introduction

The Council of the European Union shares decision-making power with the [
European Parliament ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-
institutions/european-parliament/) , particularly in the areas of law-making
and budget approval.

The Council consists of a government minister from each member state. It is a
single legal entity, although members are not fixed. The government ministers
on the Council will depend on the type of laws or policies that are being
discussed.

For example, if changes to agricultural laws at EU level are under discussion,
the Council will be made up of the ministers with responsibility for
agriculture of each member state (the council of ministers).

The presidency of the Council rotates every 6 months.

The Council of the European Union is a different organisation to both the [
European Council ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-
institutions/european-council/) and the [ Council of Europe
](https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal) (which is not an EU institution).
