##  How to apply

You must make a tax return of total income, including income that is exempt
from tax.

When you first claim tax exemption, you will need to send the following
documents to Revenue:

  * A medical certificate detailing the incapacity and confirming that the beneficiaries are permanently unable to support themselves 
  * A copy of the trust deed 

Setting up a trust fund has complex legal implications. It is important to get
advice from a qualified legal professional (for example, a [ solicitor
](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) ). You may want to discuss the tax
implications with an accountant or Revenue (or both).

It is also possible to get tax relief for payments made to incapacited
individuals, through a [ deed of covenant ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-
credits-and-reliefs/deeds-of-covenant/) .
