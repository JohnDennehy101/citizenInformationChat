##  Introduction

A trust fund is a legal agreement that allows someone, known as a _trustee_ ,
to control and invest the money of someone else, known as the _beneficiary_ .
In some cases there may be more than one beneficiary for a trust.

Investments made by trust funds are usually subject to tax but a trust fund
may be exempt from tax if the beneficiary is _permanently incapacitated_ .
This means that you are permanently unable to earn money to support yourself
due to mental or physical illness or disability.

If a trust fund meets certain requirements, it can be exempt from:

  * Income tax, PRSI and Universal Social Charge (USC) on income from the fund 
  * Capital Gains Tax on assets bought using the fund
