##  Force majeure leave

If you have a family crisis, you have a right to limited time off work. This
is called _force majeure leave_ .

You may need to take force majeure leave for an urgent family reason, such as
the unexpected injury or illness of a ‘close family member’.

A _close family member_ includes:

  * Your child (including an adopted child) 
  * Your spouse or partner 
  * Your parent or grandparent 
  * Your sibling 
  * Someone who you have a duty of care for (for example, you are acting in place of a parent, also known as _loco parentis_ ) 
  * Someone who depends on you for care (known as ‘domestic dependency’) 
  * Other people as defined by law 

If a close family member has died, you do not have an entitlement to force
majeure leave. Instead, you may be able to take ‘compassionate leave’ – read
