##  How to make a complaint

If you and your employer disagree about leave (for example, there is a dispute
about your entitlement to force majeure leave), you can make a formal
complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).

You must use the [ online complaint form
](https://workplacerelations.ie/en/e-complaint_form/) . All complaints must be
made **within 6 months** of the dispute happening.

The time limit may be extended for a further 6 months if you can show there
was a ‘reasonable cause’ for the delay.
