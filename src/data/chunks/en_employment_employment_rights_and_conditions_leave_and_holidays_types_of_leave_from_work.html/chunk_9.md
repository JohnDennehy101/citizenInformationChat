##  Career break or study leave

You don’t have an automatic right to take unpaid leave for a career break or
study leave. Check your contract, as some employers allow this.

If your contract does not cover career breaks or study leave, you may be able
to negotiate it with your employer.

Your employer should consider any request for a career break or study leave on
an individual, case-by-case basis.
