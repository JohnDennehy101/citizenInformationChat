###  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland

The [ Food Safety Authority of Ireland ](/en/health/food-safety/food-safety-
authority-of-ireland/) (FSAI) is an independent statutory organisation. It
protects consumers by ensuring that food safety and hygiene standards are met
in shops, restaurants, hotels, market stalls and fishing vessels.

It does this by:

  * Sending food safety inspectors to test food samples for contamination 
  * Training food safety inspectors and other food industry workers on food law 
  * Telling the public when there is a food safety issue, such as a product recall or restaurant closure 
  * Investigating food labels and fraudulent food 
  * Developing food safety guidelines 
  * Advising on national nutrition policy 

The FSAI also works with other state agencies to ensure that food law is
enforced, including the [ Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority
](http://www.sfpa.ie/) and the [ Health Service Executive (HSE)
](/en/health/health-system/health-service-executive/) .

If you would like to make a food safety complaint about a food outlet, such as
a supermarket or restaurant, you can [ submit a complaint form
](https://www.fsai.ie/makeitbetter/) to the FSAI. They will refer your
complaint to the appropriate [ Environmental Health Office
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/environ/environmental-health-
officers.html) for investigation.
