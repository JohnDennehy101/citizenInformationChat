##  Introduction

Companies that supply electricity or gas (or both) to homes and businesses in
Ireland, are licenced to do so by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities
(CRU). The role of the CRU is to protect consumers, ensure that supply is kept
at a high standard and to promote competition in the industry. The CRU also
regulates Uisce Éireann (previously called Irish Water).

If you have a complaint about your energy supplier or Uisce Éireann
(previously called Irish Water), and you cannot resolve that complaint with
the supplier directly, you can bring the problem to the CRU to investigate.
