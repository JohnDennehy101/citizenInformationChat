##  How your PRSI contributions are recorded

If you are self-employed, you pay [ Class S social insurance contributions
directly to Revenue ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-
employment/guide-to-self-assessment/prsi-need-pay.aspx) , when you send in
your tax returns for the year.

Revenue then pays the money into the Social Insurance Fund, and sends a record
of the contributions you have paid to the Department of Social Protection.

You can request a copy of your complete [ PRSI record online at MyWelfare.ie
](https://services.mywelfare.ie/en/topics/statements-refunds-and-
calculators/contribution-statement/) . If you have difficulty using this
online facility, you can contact the PRSI Records section for assistance (see
'More information' below).

Note that you pay Class S contributions in an annual payment for your full tax
year. There is no mechanism for awarding credits for a full year or part of a
year.
