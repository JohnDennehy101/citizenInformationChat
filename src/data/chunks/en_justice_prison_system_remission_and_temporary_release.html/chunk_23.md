####  **The Resettlement Service**

The Resettlement Service can provide help with planning for life after prison,
accessing health services and emergency accommodation, and applying for
housing, medical cards and social welfare benefits.

You need to have less than 18 months left on your sentence and you need to be
referred to the service by someone from the prison, such as the Governor,
Chief Officer, Chaplain, etc.
