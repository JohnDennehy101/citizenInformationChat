###  **Factors considered in a parole review**

In making its decisions, the Parole Board considers several factors,
including:

  * Whether you pose a threat to the community or a previous victim 
  * Whether you have been rehabilitated and are capable of reintegrating into society 
  * The nature and circumstances of the offence you committed 
  * Any recommendation made by the court at the time of sentencing 
  * Your behaviour in custody, particularly your engagement with therapeutic services designed to mitigate your offending behaviour 
  * The risk of you failing to comply with any conditions 
  * Submissions made by or on behalf of any victim 
  * Any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration
