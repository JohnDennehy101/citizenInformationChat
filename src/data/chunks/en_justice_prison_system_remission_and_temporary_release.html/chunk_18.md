####  **Victims of crime and the parole process**

If you are a victim of a crime where the offender has been sentenced to life
in prison, you can [ register with the Parole Board
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/7d2fb-information-for-victims-on-the-
parole-act-2019-and-the-parole-process/) . If you register and the offender
applies for parole, you will be asked if you wish to make a submission to the
Parole Board.
