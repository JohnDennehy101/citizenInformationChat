###  **Technical requirements**

An e-bike used on a public road must have:

  * A maximum power output of 250 watts or less 
  * A motor that cuts off once you stop pedalling 
  * A maximum speed of 25km per hour 
  * Front and rear lights (switched on during lighting-up hours and darkness) 

Cargo bikes which meet these exact requirements are also classified as
e-bikes.

An e-bike that does not meet these technical standards is categorised as an
e-moped.
