##  What is an e-bike?

An e-bike is a pedal-assisted electric bike. _Pedal-assisted_ means the
electric motor stops providing power when you stop pedalling.

[ E-bikes are treated the same as conventional bikes ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/cycling/overview-cycling/) under Irish law. You do not need a
licence to ride one and your e-bike does not need to be registered, taxed or
insured.

While it is not illegal for children to ride e-bikes in public places, young
children should always be supervised.
