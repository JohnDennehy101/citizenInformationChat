##  Cycling

[ Cycling
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel_and_recreation/cycling/) is an
affordable, healthy, and environmentally friendly mode of transport.

A tax break is available to employees who buy new bikes and equipment under
the [ Cycle to Work Scheme ](/en/travel-and-recreation/cycling/cycle-to-work-
scheme/) . You can also use [ bike sharing schemes ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/cycling/overview-cycling#lc562c) to combine public transport with
bike hire when you commute to work.

When you return to Ireland, it's important you understand the [ laws on
cycling ](/en/travel-and-recreation/cycling/cycling-offences/) and the rules
regarding [ bike lights ](/en/travel-and-recreation/cycling/lighting-of-
bicycles-in-ireland/) .
