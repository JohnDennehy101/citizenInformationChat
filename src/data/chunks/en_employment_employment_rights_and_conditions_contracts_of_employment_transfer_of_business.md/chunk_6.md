####  **Service changes**

A change of contractors is not a transfer of an undertaking. So, if a new
service contractor takes over a contract from your employer, you generally
wonâ€™t have the right to transfer to the new contractor under TUPE.

Service contract changes are common in contracts for office cleaning,
catering, or security.
