###  **Dismissal**

The transfer of a business (or part of it), does not automatically give your
employer the right to dismiss you.

However, your employer can end your employment if they have justifiable
economic, technical, or organisational reasons.

Whether these reasons are justified will depend on the specific circumstances
of each case. If you disagree with the grounds for dismissal, you can claim
for [ unfair dismissal
