###  **Unfair dismissal**

If your employment contract is terminated due to a transfer that substantially
worsens your working conditions, your employer is considered responsible for
the termination.

For example, if your new employer cuts your wages leading you to resign, your
new employer is held responsible for not honoring your employment contract.
