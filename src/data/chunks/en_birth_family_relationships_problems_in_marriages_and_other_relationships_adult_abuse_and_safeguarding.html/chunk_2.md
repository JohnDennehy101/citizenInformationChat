##  What is adult abuse?

Adult abuse happens when a person’s rights, independence or dignity are not
respected. This can be deliberate, or it can be caused by a lack of knowledge,
or omission of care. However, all circumstances of not respecting a person’s
rights are abusive.

Abuse can affect any adult at any stage of life and any person is at risk. It
is more likely to happen when people are more vulnerable – for example people
living with, a physical or intellectual disability, an acquired brain injury,
a mental health condition, or in situations of coercive control or frailty due
to age. A vulnerable person is someone who is not able to protect themselves
from harm or exploitation, or their ability to report instances of harm or
exploitation may be limited.

Abuse can be perpetrated (carried out) by a range of people, such as
strangers, institutions, or family members. It may happen when an older person
or a person with a disability lives alone or with a relative. It may also
happen in residential or day-care settings, in hospitals, home support
services and other places assumed to be safe.

[ Elder abuse ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-
relationships/older-people/elder-abuse/) is the abuse of someone aged 65 or
over and it happens in a relationship where there is an expectation of trust.
