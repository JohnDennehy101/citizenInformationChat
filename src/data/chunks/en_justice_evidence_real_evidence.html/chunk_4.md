###  Material objects

An example of a material object in a murder case is the murder weapon. This is
a piece of real evidence, which can be introduced in court. Sometimes, it is
impossible to produce a material object at trial because it has been destroyed
or lost. Photographs, replicas or the oral evidence of someone who has seen
the object may be allowed instead.

Sometimes, if the material object cannot be shown in court a 'view' or an out-
of-court inspection can be carried out.
