###  Video recordings

Incidents or crimes are often captured and recorded by video cameras or CCTV.
These recordings are accepted in court as real evidence. If evidence of a
crime is recorded on a street or shop camera, the Gardaí are obliged to seize
and keep the recording for a reasonable time, even if they do not intend to
use it as part of the prosecution case.

In order to use video recordings as evidence, the prosecution must prove that
the video recording is authentic or genuine. The prosecution must explain how
and why the recording was made and who had the recording after it was made.
The defence can object on these grounds, and if they do, it is up to the judge
to decide whether to allow the recording as evidence.

If the Gardaí decide not to use a recording as evidence at trial, the
prosecution or Gardaí must notify the defence that the recording exists. They
must also give the defence advance notice if they decide to destroy the
recording. Because even though the recording may not be of use to the
prosecution, it may help the accused prove they were not at the [ scene of the
crime ](/en/justice/evidence/crime-scenes/) .

While there is a duty on the Gardaí to collect video evidence, they do not
have to go to extreme lengths to do so. For example, the Gardaí would not need
to collect every piece of video evidence on O’Connell Street in Dublin if
there was a theft from a shop on the street.
