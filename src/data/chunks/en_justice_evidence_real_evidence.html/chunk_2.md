##  Introduction

Real evidence is material, tangible evidence such as an object, a tape
recording, a computer printout or a photograph. It is evidence that the court
can examine for itself.

Generally, real evidence does not stand alone, and the court will hear
evidence from a witness (often an [ expert witness
](/en/justice/witnesses/types-of-witnesses/) ) explaining the significance or
the relevance of the real evidence.
