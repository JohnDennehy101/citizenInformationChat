##  Occupational and personal pensions

The rules governing [ occupational pensions ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) and personal pensions depend on the
terms of the pension. If your loved one was a member of a pension scheme, you
should contact the scheme administrators to find out if there is a pension for
the spouse, civil partner and/or children. Self-employed people may have
pension arrangements that involve some of the investments becoming part of the
estate when the person dies.

Divorced people and people whose civil partnership has been dissolved may have
[ access to some part of the pension scheme ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/sep-divorce-pensions/) depending on
whether a pension adjustment order was made at the time of the divorce or
dissolution.
