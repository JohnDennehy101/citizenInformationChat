##  How can mediation help?

Relationship breakdown can be very emotional and stressful â€“ making it
particularly difficult to agree decisions in relation to living arrangements,
finances and childcare.

Mediation encourages a separating couple to co-operate with each other in
working out mutually acceptable arrangements on all or any of the following:

  * Parenting the children 
  * Education, schooling or childcare arrangements 
  * Family holidays and special occasions 
  * Financial support 
  * Family home and property, division of assets 
  * Other problems related to the separation 

The role of the mediator is to:

  * See a couple together and look at the issues to be discussed and agreed. 
  * Create a climate in which neither party dominates but in which both parties participate fully in good faith. 
  * Create and maintain an atmosphere of co-operation and responsibility. 
  * Help couples deal with difficult emotional issues that can prevent them reaching agreement. 
  * Help couples reach agreement that they both find acceptable.
