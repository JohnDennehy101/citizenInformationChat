##  How does mediation work?

For mediation to work, both parties must confirm their willingness to attend.

Mediation is a process, which means there is a structure and formula in how it
is delivered. The issues discussed depend on the needs and wishes of the
separating couple.

With the help of a mediator, the couple systematically consider each issue,
explore their options and come to decisions. The parties are encouraged to get
expert advice such as legal or financial advice to ensure that the separating
couple can make informed decisions that they both find acceptable.

Discussions are confidential and the mediator does not take sides.
