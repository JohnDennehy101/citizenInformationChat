##  What is the outcome of mediation?

Most mediations end with a written document, sometimes referred to as a Note
of Mediated Agreement, that sets out all the details of the couple's
agreement.

The type of agreements that may be reached include:

  * **Comprehensive agreements** : which cover all issues resulting from the separation including finance, parenting, accommodation etc 
  * **Parenting agreements** : which address parenting issues and support good parenting models 
  * **Financial agreements** : which cover the finances and assets of the couple 
  * **Interim agreements** : where the parties make an agreement for a specific time frame 
  * **Partial agreements** : which addresses a particular issue or issues 

The mediated agreement is not a legal agreement, however, you can bring this
document to a solicitor to be drawn into a legal contract or [ deed of
separation ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/separation-
agreement/) . You may also use it as the basis for a [ decree of divorce
](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/divorce-decrees/) .
