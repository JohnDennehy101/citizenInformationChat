###  **Midwifery-led clinics**

You can choose to get maternity care from experienced midwives in a midwifery-
led clinic. This clinic is usually based in the hospital, and is provided
alongside care from your consultant.

If a problem during your labour is detected or anticipated, your team of
midwives will contact the on-call obstetrician (a specialist in pregnany and
childbirth).

After you give birth, you can leave the hospital earlier (early discharge) if
appropriate. One of the team of midwives will visit you at home (daily if
necessary) for after birth (postnatal) care.

If you want to attend the midwifery-led clinic, tell your midwife or
consultant during your first antenatal visit.
