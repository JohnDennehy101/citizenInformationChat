####  **You reply to the proceedings**

If you want to fight the action taken by the mortgage provider to repossess
your home, you must:

  * Complete the _appearance form_ attached to the civil bill. File it with the Circuit Court Office within 10 days of being served the civil bill. A copy of this form must also be served on the solicitors representing your financial institution. 
  * Prepare an [ affidavit ](/en/justice/witnesses/affidavit/) replying to the mortgage providerâ€™s claim. File this with the Circuit Court Office and send a copy to the mortgage provider at least 4 days before the return date. 

If you think there are technical errors or serious issues with the
proceedings, you can take a further step and prepare _a defence_ .

This is a document which sets out the reasons the court should not make a
possession order in favour of your financial institution.

It must be served on the solicitors for your financial institution within 10
days of serving them your appearance form.

You should get legal advice if you are thinking about taking this step.
