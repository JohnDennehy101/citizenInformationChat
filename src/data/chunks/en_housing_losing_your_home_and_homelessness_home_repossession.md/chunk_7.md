##  What are the court procedures for home repossessions?

If your home is being repossessed because you defaulted on a housing mortgage
loan, your case must be taken to the [ Circuit Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts_system/circuit_court.en.html)
first.

A housing loan mortgage is the usual type of mortgage that people take out to
build, buy or improve a house. Cases involving repossession for default on
other kinds of mortgages can be taken to the [ Circuit Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) or [ High Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) .

The lending institution applies to the court for a possession order, a well-
charging order, or both. If they are successful, the possession order will
give the lender possession of your property and the well-charging order will
allow them to sell the property. The courts will usually give you some time to
make arrangements to repay the money owed before making any final orders.

If a possession order or well-charging order is made against you and you do
not hand over possession of the property, or comply with other terms of the
orders, the orders can be [ enforced

by the Sheriff (in Dublin and Cork), or by the County Registrar in other
areas.
