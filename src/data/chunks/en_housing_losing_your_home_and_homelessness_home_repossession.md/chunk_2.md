##  What is home repossession?

When you get a mortgage to buy a property, the property is used as security
for the mortgage debt. This means if you can’t pay your mortgage, your home
could be repossessed by your mortgage provider and sold to pay the debt.

If you don’t have a mortgage on your home, but you have other debts you can’t
repay, your home may be repossessed to cover those debts.

Your lender must apply to court to take possession of your property.
