####  **What can the court decide?**

The County Registrar can:

  * Grant the order for possession – giving the financial institution possession of your property 
  * Dismiss the case 
  * Adjourn the case – giving you and your financial institution time to reach an agreement 

If you **did not file an appearance form** , the County Register can make an
order for possession, and a well-charging order.

If you **filed an appearance form and affidavit, but your affidavit did not
show any obvious defence** , the County Registrar can also make an order for
possession.

If you **filed an appearance and your affidavit shows a proper defence** , the
case must be sent to be heard by a judge.

The judge can then grant or refuse the possession order.

The procedure in the Circuit Court is governed by the Rules of the Circuit
Court, which are set out in the [ Circuit Court Rules (Actions for Possession
and Wellcharging Relief) 2009
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/si/0264.html) .
