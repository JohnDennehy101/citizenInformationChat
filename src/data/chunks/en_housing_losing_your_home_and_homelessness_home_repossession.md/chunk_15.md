##  Repossession for other debts and loans

If you owe money for any reason and the creditor is trying to get repayment,
they can create a _judgment mortgage_ on your property.

A judgment mortgage has broadly the same effect as a conventional mortgage on
your home and can be enforced by way of a mortgage suit.

First the creditor gets a _judgment order._ Then they get an _execution order_
usually called a _fi fa order._ If the execution order doesnâ€™t result in
payment of the debt, the creditor can get a judgment mortgage on your
property.
