####  **Judgment mortgage**

A _judgment mortgage_ is often created when the order of _fi fa_ fails to
deliver any property. However, a judgment creditor can create a judgment
mortgage instead of looking for a fi fa order.

Creating a judgment mortgage involves registering the judgment as a mortgage
against your property. Effectively, the judgment is converted into a mortgage
and this is registered in the [ Land Registry or Registry of Deeds
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning_a_home/buying_a_home/property_deeds.en.html)
.

Registration of the judgment mortgage does not have any automatic immediate
effect until the judgment creditor decides to either:

  * Force a sale 
  * Claim entitlement to the proceeds of a sale by the judgment debtor 

A judgment mortgage has broadly the same effect as a conventional mortgage and
can be enforced with a mortgage suit.
