##  Introduction

The Citizens Information Service works hard to make sure that the service we
provide is up to date, relevant and of the highest standard. However, there
may be times when you are unhappy with the service. The Citizens Information
Service is committed to dealing effectively with any complaints you may have
about our service. We also aim to learn from our mistakes and use the
information we gain to improve our services.

While your complaint will be dealt with in confidence, be aware that it will
be discussed with those staff necessary to investigate the complaint. If you
wish to see a specific outcome to your complaint, please tell us what this is.
We cannot guarantee that this outcome will be achieved but it does help us to
understand what the expectation is.

We will make sure that your interactions with us in the future do not suffer
just because you have made a complaint.

If you wish to make a complaint this is how you do it.
