##  Enforcing your judgment

If a judgment has been given in the claim, the respondent has 28 calendar days
to comply. If they do not comply within this timeframe, you may need to [
enforce your judgment ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/enforcement-
of-debt-judgments/) .

To enforce your judgment, the following steps apply:

  1. You must contact the Small Claims Registrar to notify them. 
  2. The Registrar gives you a decree. 
  3. You give the decree to a Sheriff or County Registrar for execution. 
  4. The Sheriff or County Registrar goes to the respondent and seizes goods or money to the value set out in the decree. 

You can read more about [ enforcement procedures

Further information and assistance is available from the Small Claims
Registrar.
