####  3\. They consent to judgment

The respondent consents to judgment, which means they agree to allow the court
to rule against them in the case. This means they will only pay after the
claim has been reviewed by a judge in the [ District Court
](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) and a judgment made in the case.

You will swear an [ Affidavit of Debt ](/en/justice/witnesses/affidavit/) and
the respondent is issued with a Notice to Pay. The respondent has 28 calendar
days to pay, and if they do not, you will be given a decree for the Sheriff.
The Registrar will assist you with this process (see ‘Enforcing your judgment’
below).
