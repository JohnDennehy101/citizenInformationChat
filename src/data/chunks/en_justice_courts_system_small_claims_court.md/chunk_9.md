####  Claim section

Here, you should set out the details of the claim clearly. These details
should include:

  * When you bought the goods or services, when the work was carried out, or when the property was damaged 
  * What went wrong and how you handled it 
  * Why you are taking court action 
  * How much you are claiming for 

You normally can only claim for the amount you have paid for the goods or have
spent on repairs. For this reason, you should include copies of any
documentation or receipts which support your claim and show how much money you
have lost.
