###  2\. You can take part in environmental decision-making

Members of the public can take part in making decisions where there may be an
environmental impact. This includes decisions about:

  * Planning 
  * Environmental licences 
  * Foreshore licences 
  * Waste licences 
  * Integrated Pollution Prevention Control (IPPC) licences 

The public authorities that make these decisions must publish notices telling
the public how they can give feedback. The public authorities must then
consider this feedback when making decisions.
