###  3\. You can access justice

Members of the public and environmental non-governmental organisations can ask
for a review of decisions from the public authority which may affect the
environment. The review procedures must provide “adequate and effective
remedies ... and be fair, equitable, timely and not prohibitively expensive”.

Normally, when the law allows for an administrative appeal against a planning
or environmental decision, the appeal should be made first to the public
authority. After you complete the standard appeal process, you can apply to
the High Court for a [ judicial review ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-
government-works/standards-and-accountability/judicial-review-public-
decisions/) of a decision.

For example, if you want to appeal a planning decision made by a local
authority, you would normally appeal to An Bord Pleanála first.
