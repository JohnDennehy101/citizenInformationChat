###  Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers

The [ Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a4642-protocol-on-pollutant-release-and-
transfer-registers-prtr-national-implementation-reports/) commits
participating countries to establishing and maintaining publicly accessible
registers with information on pollutants from certain environmentally
significant activities, such as mining and the disposal of waste.

A Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR) is a national or regional
environmental database. It lists all the potentially hazardous chemical
substances and pollutants released into the air, water and soil, and
transferred for treatment or disposal.

In Ireland the [ Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) manages Irelandâ€™s PRTR
](https://www.epa.ie/our-services/compliance--enforcement/whats-
happening/pollutant-release-and-transfer-register/) . It contains information
about emissions from more than 300 industrial facilities across the State and
enables members of the public to find out about the major sources of emissions
in their locality.
