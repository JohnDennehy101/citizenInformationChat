##  How many breaks should I get?

You have a right to:

  * A 15 minute break when you have worked more than 4 Â½ hours 
  * A 30 minute break when you have worked more than 6 hours, which can include the first 15-minute break. 

The break should not be at the end of the working day.

You have no legal right to be paid for these breaks and they are not
considered working time. Whether you are paid for them depends on [ your
employment contract ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) .

**Example**

If you start work at 7am you are entitled to take a 15-minute break at
11.30am.

At 1.15pm when you have worked 6 hours you are entitled to take a break of 30
minutes. As you have already taken a break at 11.15, your employer can limit
this break to 15 minutes.

If you start working again at 1.30pm or 1.45pm and continue working until 6 or
6.15pm you are entitled to another 15-minute break.
