##  What can a decision-making assistant do?

The decision-making assistant can only help with decisions that are included
in your decision-making assistance agreement. This means they will be able to
access relevant information and records for you if you have included this task
in your agreement. This might involve getting records or information from your
bank, utility, or healthcare provider.

Your decision-making assistant will have the legal authority to:

  * Help you gather relevant information and explain it to you 
  * Help you understand and weigh up your options 
  * Support you by letting other people know about the decision that has been made 

Your decision-making assistant does not make a decision with or for you. They
support you to make your own decisions.

You can get more information about the role and responsibilities of the
decision-making assistant in the [ Code of Practice for the guidance of
decision-making assistants.
