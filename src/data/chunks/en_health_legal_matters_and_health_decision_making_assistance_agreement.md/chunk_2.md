##  Introduction

If you have difficulty making certain decisions on your own or think you may
soon have a difficulty, you can make a decision-making assistance agreement
and choose a person you trust to be your decision-making assistant.

This agreement allows you to choose which decisions you need help with. It
also gives your chosen person the legal recognition to help you to make those
decisions for yourself. Your decision-making assistant does not make decisions
for you. Instead, they help you to make your own decisions.

The decisions in your agreement can be about your personal welfare, property
and money matters.

For example, they may help you make decisions about your home or assist you in
making decisions about employment, training or social activities.

You can decide how long the agreement can last. It can be for a certain length
of time, or it can be ongoing.

Decision-making assistance agreements are one of the agreements that can be
made under the [ Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015
](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/assisted-decision-making-act/) . If you
need someone to make decisions with you, you can make a [ co-decision making
agreement ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/co-decision-making-agreement/)
.
