##  How to make a decision-making assistance agreement

Your agreement must:

  * Be in writing 
  * Include details of the decisions that your decision-making assistant will help you with 
  * Include a statement by you to show you understand the agreement 
  * Be signed by you and your decision-making assistant 

Your decision-making assistant must confirm that they understand their duties
and will carry them out.

The easiest way to make an agreement is through the MyDSS portal using [ your
MyGovID ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/egovernment/mygovid/)
