##  Who can be a decision-making assistant?

Your decision-making assistant must be an adult (aged 18 years and over). You
must know and trust the person you are choosing. You can have more than one
decision-making assistant in any agreement, and you can have multiple
agreements each dealing with different matters.

The person cannot be a decision-making assistant if they:

  * Have been convicted of an offence against you or your child 
  * Are financially insolvent or have been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty (unless the agreement is about personal welfare decisions) 
  * Are the owner or a registered provider of a designated care or mental health facility where you live or the employee of such a person (unless they are your relative) 
  * Were removed from the role of a decision-making assistant for you 

A decision-making assistantâ€™s appointment may also end if:

  * The assistant is your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant and your relationship ends 
  * They become ineligible to be a decision-making assistant for one of the above reasons.
