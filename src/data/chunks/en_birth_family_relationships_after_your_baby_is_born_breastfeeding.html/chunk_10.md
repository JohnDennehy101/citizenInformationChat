##  Breastfeeding and employment

If you are working in Ireland and breastfeeding your baby, you are entitled to
take time off work each day to breastfeed. This applies to all women (or
birthing parents) in employment who have given birth within the previous 2
years (104 weeks). You are entitled to have your normal rest breaks as well.

Employers do not have to provide facilities in the workplace to facilitate
breastfeeding if providing such facilities would give rise to considerable
costs. At the choice of your employer, you are entitled to:

  * [ Breastfeed in the workplace ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/breastfeeding-and-work.html) or [ express breast milk ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/expressing-breast-milk/when-you-might-want-to-express.html) , where suitable facilities are available in your workplace, or 
  * Have your working hours reduced (without loss of pay) to facilitate breastfeeding where suitable facilities are not available. 

If you are working and breastfeeding, you are entitled to take 1 hour off work
(with pay) each day as a breastfeeding break for up to 2 years (104 weeks)
after birth. This time may be taken as:

  * One 60 minute break 
  * Two 30 minute breaks 
  * Three 20 minute breaks 

Breaks may be longer and more frequent if agreed between you and your
employer. Check with your employer what their policy is.

Part-time workers are also entitled to breastfeeding breaks, calculated on a
pro-rata basis.

Your employer cannot deduct pay for the time you took on a breastfeeding
break. Your right to time off is set out under Section 9 of the [ Maternity
Protection (Amendment) Act 2004
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0028/index.html) , as amended
by the [ Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2023
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2023/act/8/enacted/en/print#sec34) .
