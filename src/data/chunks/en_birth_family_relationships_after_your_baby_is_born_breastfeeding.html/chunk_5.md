###  At the hospital or at home

After you give birth, your midwife will have lots of experience with
breastfeeding mothers and will be able to help you get started. You can also [
get help from lactation consultants ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/ask-our-
breastfeeding-expert/) who have specific training in breastfeeding support.
Many hospitals run a weekly drop-in breastfeeding clinic so you can talk to
breastfeeding experts and other mothers, and get ongoing support.
