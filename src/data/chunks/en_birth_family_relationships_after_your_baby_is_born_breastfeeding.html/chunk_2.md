##  Introduction

There are many benefits of breastfeeding for both you and your baby. Your
breast milk provides all the nutrients your baby needs for growth and
development. When you come into contact with a virus or bacteria, your body
will make antibodies to protect itself. These antibodies are passed into your
breast milk so your baby is protected too. Breastfeeding also helps your womb
recover more quickly after birth and reduces your risk of certain diseases.
