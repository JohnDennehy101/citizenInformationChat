##  Returning to work while still breastfeeding

If you want to continue to breastfeed when you return to work, you must notify
your employer (in writing) of your intention to breastfeed at work. You should
confirm this at least 4 weeks before the date you plan to return to work from
your maternity leave. Employers can require you to supply the child’s birth
certificate (or some other document confirming the child’s date of birth).
