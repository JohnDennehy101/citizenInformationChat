###  Breastfeeding support groups

Breastfeeding support groups take place all around Ireland. At breastfeeding
support groups, mothers share breastfeeding advice and socialise. There are
also opportunities to speak with a breastfeeding expert about any questions
you have. These groups also encourage pregnant women to come along before you
have your baby if you are considering breastfeeding and want to find out how
to prepare.

Both [ Cuidiú
](https://www.cuidiu.ie/supports_breastfeeding_breastfeedinggroups) and [ La
Leche League of Ireland ](https://www.lalecheleagueireland.com/groups/)
organise breastfeeding support groups and coffee mornings.

[ Friends of Breastfeeding ](https://www.friendsofbreastfeeding.ie/) have
trained ‘Breastfeeding Buddies’ who are available to give you breastfeeding
support by text, phone, email or video call.
