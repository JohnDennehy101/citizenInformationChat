###  **Note 3: Income from savings for a couple**

Joe and Jean’s income from savings is calculated as follows:

First €40,000  |  Nil   
---|---  
Next €20,000  |  €1 per €1,000 per week   
Next €20,000  |  €2 per €1,000 per week   
Excess €80,000  |  €4 per €1,000 per week   
  
John and Jean have savings of €56,000. The first €40,000 is not taken into
account for the means test, but the remaining €16,000 is taken into account.
So, their assessable income from savings is €16.
