##  How to make a complaint

As a consumer, you have a right to safe food when you are eating out. Do not
accept food if you find it is unfit to eat.

Food may be unfit to eat if it:

  * Is not piping hot 
  * Smells ‘off’ 
  * Appears to be contaminated with chemicals or detergents 
  * Is off-colour – for example, if chicken is pink in the centre 
  * Contains a foreign object such as hair or insects 

Food may also be unfit to eat if it has been prepared in a place with poor
hygiene standards. When eating out, you should check whether:

  * The restaurant or café is visibly dirty 
  * Staff use dirty cloths to clean multiple surfaces 
  * Staff have dirty hands 
  * Staff handle food and money without wearing gloves or washing their hands in-between 

If you are unhappy about the quality of food you have purchased, or if you are
concerned about the cleanliness of a food premises, you can make a complaint.
