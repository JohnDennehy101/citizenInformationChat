##  How is food safety enforced?

The FSAI enforces [ food safety laws in Ireland
](https://www.fsai.ie/legislation/FSAI_act_related.html) through service
contracts with official agencies, including the Health Service Executive
(HSE).

An authorised officer, such as an [ Environmental Health Officer
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/environ/Contact.html) , will search
and inspect the food premises. They may take samples of food and other
material as part of their investigation.
