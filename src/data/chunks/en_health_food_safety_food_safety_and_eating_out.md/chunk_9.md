###  Making a complaint

You should first complain to the person who is serving you. Next, you should
speak to the manager on duty.

You may want to fill in the FSAIâ€™s [ online complaint form
](https://www.fsai.ie/makeitbetter/) . The information you give on this form
is confidential and will not be shared with the food premises. Instead, it
will usually be given to the local Environmental Health Office (EHO) who will
then carry out an investigation.
