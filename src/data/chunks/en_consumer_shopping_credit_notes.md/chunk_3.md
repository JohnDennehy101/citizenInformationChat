##  Is it legal for a business to offer me a credit note instead of a refund?

Yes, businesses are legally allowed to **offer** you a credit note in place of
a refund. In some cases a shop may give you a credit note as a goodwill
gesture, for example if you change your mind about something you bought (for
products bought in a shop, you do not have a legal right to a refund because
you change your mind).

However, if you are legally entitled to a refund, then the business cannot
insist that you accept a credit note or voucher instead (except in very
limited cases for package holidays – see below).

In general terms, you have a legal right (also called your _statutory right_ )
to a refund for:

  * Items or services bought online which you cancel or return during the ‘cooling off period’ 
  * Flight cancellations and package holiday cancellations – see more below 

You also have a legal right to certain _remedies_ if a product breaks, is not
fit for purpose or does not do what the advert or seller said it would. A
remedy could be a repair, replacement or a refund.
