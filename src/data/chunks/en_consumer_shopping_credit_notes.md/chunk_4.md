##  Do I have to accept a credit note or voucher?

In general, you do not have to accept a credit note if your complaint is
covered by consumer law (except in very limited cases for package holidays â€“
see below). Instead, you can insist on a repair, a replacement or a refund.

If you accept a credit note you may not be able to ask for a refund
afterwards.
