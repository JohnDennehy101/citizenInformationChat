##  Airline credit notes and vouchers

Where your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a choice of:

  * Refund of the cost of your ticket within 7 days or 
  * Re-routing to your final destination at the earliest opportunity or 
  * Re-routing at a later date at your convenience, subject to availability of seats 

A refund in this case means a cash refund (or a refund onto the original
method of payment, where you paid by debit card or credit card or by cheque or
bank order). Airlines can offer a refund by means of a credit note or a
voucher but you do not have to accept this and can insist on getting a full
refund.

These rules are set out in [ EU Regulation 261/2004(pdf)
](http://www.aviationreg.ie/_fileupload/Image/Regulation EC261 2004.pdf) .
