**JobsPlus** : The number of positions for long-term unemployed people on the
JobsPlus scheme is being doubled to 6,000. In addition, a new JobsPlus strand
for young people will be launched early in 2015 under the Youth Guarantee.

The **Seed Capital Scheme** is being rebranded as "Start-Up Relief for
Entrepreneurs" (SURE) and being extended to people who have been unemployed
for up to 2 years.

In 2015 the **Pathways to Work strategy** will be supported by €1.6 billion
and will be made available to provide approximately 300,000 work and training
places.

The **JobPath** initiative has been allocated €12 million in 2015\. This will
match long-term unemployed people with appropriate training and employment
opportunities.

**Community Employment (CE)** will be given almost €16 million in additional
funding and total funding of €373 million for 25,500 places in 2015,
including:

  * €29 million for 2,200 places on the new 3-year community-based childcare programme 
  * €15 million for over 1,000 places on the Drug Rehabilitation Schemes 
  * Roll-out of the new Health and Social Care programme 

The **Local Community Development Programme** supporting one-to-one labour
market training for 10,000 people who are distanced from the labour market
will end in Q1 2015. Its successor, the **Social Inclusion and Community
Activation Programme (SICAP)** will support a further 30,000 people in 2015.
