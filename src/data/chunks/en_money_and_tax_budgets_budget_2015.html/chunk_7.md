###  Valued Added Tax (VAT)

The 9% rate of VAT is being retained for tourism-related activities.

From 1 January 2015, cross-border EU telecommunications, broadcasting and
electronically supplied services will be charged to VAT in the Member State of
the consumer and not the supplier. As a net recipient of these services, it is
estimated that Ireland will gain VAT revenues of €100m in 2015, rising to
€150m in 2019.
