###  On the day of the funeral

A funeral venue can operate at full capacity. Protective measures, like mask
wearing are no longer required. You may feel more comfortable wearing a face
mask and can do so if you prefer.

Anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 should stay at home, away from the funeral
(even if they are a close family member).
