##  Tenancy agreements

When you rent your home from a private landlord or an approved housing body,
you have an agreement or contract with that person or body, known as a tenancy
agreement – which may or may not be in writing. The most common types of
tenancy are fixed-term tenancies and periodic tenancies – both described in
more detail below. A tenancy agreement cannot contain terms that contradict
the legal rights of tenants and landlords.
