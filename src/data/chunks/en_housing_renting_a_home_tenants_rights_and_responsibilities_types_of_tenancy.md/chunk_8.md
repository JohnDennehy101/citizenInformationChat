###  Part 4 tenancy

If your tenancy was created before 11 June 2022 and you have been renting for
at least 6 months and haven't been served with a valid written notice of
termination, you automatically get security of tenure and can stay in the
property for 6 years. This is known as a Part 4 tenancy.

A Part 4 tenancy refers to [ Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/section/25/enacted/en/html#part4)
, which deals with security of tenure. If you have a periodic tenancy (a
tenancy without a fixed length of time), you do not have to claim the Part 4
tenancy in writing, but you do need to claim it if you have a fixed-term lease
â€“ see below.

Under the old rules, security of tenure continued in 6-year cycles. But, from
11 June 2022, when your tenancy ends after 6 years, it will automatically
become a tenancy of unlimited duration, if the landlord does not terminate it
under the old rules.
