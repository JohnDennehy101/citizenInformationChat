##  Security of tenure and the law

Initially tenants had the right to stay in rented accommodation for up to 4
years, following an initial 6-month period. This right was introduced under
the [ Residential Tenancies Act 2004
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2004/act/27/enacted/en/html) and meant
that your tenancy became a Part 4 tenancy. This could be followed by a further
Part 4 tenancy after the first 4 years, see Part 4 and further Part 4
tenancies below. The [ Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential
Tenancies Act 2016
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2016/act/17/schedule/enacted/en/html)
extended a Part 4 tenancy (security of tenure) from 4 years to 6 years for
tenancies created from 24 December 2016.

Then the [ Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2021/145/) brought in tenancies of
unlimited duration for tenancies created from 11 June 2022.
