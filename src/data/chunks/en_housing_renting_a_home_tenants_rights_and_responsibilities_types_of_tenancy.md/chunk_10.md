###  **Landlords' right to end a tenancy every 6 years**

If your tenancy was created before 11 June 2022, your landlord can terminate
your tenancy after 6 years for any reason. This is only allowed if:

  * The landlord served a notice of termination before the end of the 6 years, and 
  * The notice period expired on or after the end of the tenancy 

If the tenancy is not ended and a new tenancy begins after 6 years, the new
tenancy will be of unlimited duration and this rule will not be apply.
