####  **Appeal**

You can make an appeal through your solicitor or law centre staff, or by
contacting the Legal Aid Board head office.

The appeal will be considered by an appeal committee, which consists of the
Chairperson and 4 other members of the Legal Aid Board (2 of whom must be
practicing solicitors or barristers).

The decision of the appeal committee is final and unappealable.
