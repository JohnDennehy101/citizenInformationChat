##  Means test

In most cases, you need to do a means test to check if you qualify for legal
aid or advice.

To qualify, you must have:

  * Disposable income of less than €18,000 
  * Disposable capital of less than €100,000 (not including the house you live in) 

Your disposable income is calculated by deducting your total allowances from
your total annual income (see ‘How disposable income is calculated’ below).

You can use the Legal Aid Board’s online [ Financial Eligibility Indicator
](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/Apps/Questionnaire/FinancialEligibilityIndicator.aspx)
to see if you are likely to pass a means test.

In the means test, the Legal Aid Board is estimating what your disposable
income will be for the year after your application has been submitted. To do
this, they may need to consider the income you received for the last year.
