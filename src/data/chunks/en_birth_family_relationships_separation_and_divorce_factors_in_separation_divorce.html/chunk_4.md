###  Maintenance payments

In Ireland, there is no ‘standard’ amount of maintenance a spouse must pay (or
is entitled to). Instead, the court considers all factors of your personal
situation.

In some cases, your payments will be **backdated** to the date your separation
application was issued, but no earlier. The court can order these arrears to
be paid in a lump sum, and by a certain date.

All separations, divorces and dissolutions are ruled on a case-by-case basis.
