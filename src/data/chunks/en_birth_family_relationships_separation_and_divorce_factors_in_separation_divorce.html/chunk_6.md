##  After an ancillary order is made

Ancillary orders do not have to last forever. If your circumstances change
over time, or if your spouseâ€™s circumstances change, you can ask the court to:

  * _Vary_ the order (change the terms of the order, for example, how much maintenance must be paid) 
  * _Discharge_ the order (stop or end the order completely) 
  * _Suspend_ the order (temporarily pause the order)
