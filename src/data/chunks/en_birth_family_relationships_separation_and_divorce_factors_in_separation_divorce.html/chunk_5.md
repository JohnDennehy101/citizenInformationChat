##  Factors considered by the court when making an ancillary order

The court will consider all of your circumstances, and your familyâ€™s
circumstances, before making an ancillary order. These can include:

**Accommodation** | 

  * The accommodation needs of each spouse. For example, if you and your spouse have somewhere to stay, or if either of you can afford to move. 

  
---|---  
**Finances** | 

  * The current and likely future income of each spouse, including your ability to earn and any assets you have 
  * The current and future financial needs and obligations of each spouse 
  * The input each spouse or civil partner has made, and is likely to make, to the welfare of the family (this includes any contribution made that increased the income and financial resources of the other spouse) 
  * The extent to which the marriage or civil partnership affected each spouse's ability to earn 
  * The value of any benefits given up by either spouse because of the judicial separation, divorce or dissolution 

  
**Lifestyle and impact on other family members** | 

  * The standard of living of the family before the break-up of the marriage or civil partnership. While the court will take this into account, it will also accept that, in many cases, separation will result in a drop in the standard of living of both spouses 
  * The age of each spouse, the duration of the marriage or civil partnership, and the length of time the spouses or civil partners lived together 
  * Any physical or mental disability of either you or your spouse 
  * The rights of any other person affected by the judicial separation, divorce or dissolution (for example, children) 

  
**Children** | 

  * The accommodation needs of any children 
  * The financial needs of your children 
  * The educational needs of your children 
  * The physical and mental health needs of your children 

  
**Conduct** | 

  * The _conduct_ (behaviour) of each spouse
