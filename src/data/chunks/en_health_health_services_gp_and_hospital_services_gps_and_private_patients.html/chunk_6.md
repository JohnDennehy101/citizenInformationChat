##  How much does it cost to visit the GP?

GPs are usually part of the private healthcare system and so you will usually
need to pay charges when you see one. However, adults over 70 and children
under 8 are entitled to a [ GP visit card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-
visit-cards/gp-visit-cards/) , which allows them to visit a GP free of charge.

There are no set fees or charges for GP services. To visit a GP, you can
expect to pay from around 45 euro up to 65 euro (in some urban areas). Contact
your GP before your first visit to find out about charges.

GPs may provide certain services to private patients free of charge. For
example, they might provide [ maternity and infant care services
](/en/health/health-services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-
services/) and immunisation and vaccination services, if they have agreements
with the HSE.

In the case of some vaccination services (for example, the [ flu vaccine
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/pubinfo/flu-vaccination/about-
the-vaccine/) for at-risk groups), if you are a private patient, the vaccine
is free of charge but you must pay for the GPâ€™s service.
