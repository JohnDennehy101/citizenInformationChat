##  Introduction

In Ireland, family doctors are called GPs (general practitioners). A GP is
usually the first doctor that you will see about non-emergency illnesses and
health issues.

Some GPs provide services only to private patients. You usually have to pay to
see a GP as a private patient and fees can vary.

You can see a GP free of charge if you are entitled to a [ medical card or a
GP visit card
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/medical_cards_and_gp_visit_cards/)
.

If you need to see a GP in the evening or at the weekend, you can contact your
local [ GP Out of Hours service ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-
services/gp-out-of-hours-service/) .

This document outlines the services GPs (general practitioners) offer in
