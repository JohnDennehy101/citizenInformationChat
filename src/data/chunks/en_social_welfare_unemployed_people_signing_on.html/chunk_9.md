##  Signing on every month

When you get your jobseeker’s payment, you will have to sign a declaration,
usually every month, that you are still unemployed and qualify for a
jobseeker’s payment. You may be asked to sign on more or less frequently.

Your Intreo Centre will let you know how often you must sign on. You will be
given a place, date and time to sign on.

If you don’t sign on the set day or by the end of the following day, your
payment is suspended. If you don’t sign on, your payment may be stopped.
