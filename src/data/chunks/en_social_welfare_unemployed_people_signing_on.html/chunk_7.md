###  Paper applications

You can apply for Jobseekers Benefit or Jobseeker’s Allowance using the
application form UP 1.

If you are making a repeat claim (less than 6 months since your last claim),
you fill in form [ UP 6 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/37365/2de1c35ba1ab498f819ee65731aa4086.pdf) .

Find out more about requesting an application form. Forms are also available
from your local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office.

You will also need certain documents when you apply for a jobseeker’s payment.
If you do not have these documents to hand, you should apply anyway and supply
them later. You should remember that a delay in applying for a jobseeker’s
payment may mean that you lose out on your full entitlements.

You can get help to fill in your application form at your Intreo Centre,
Social Welfare Branch Office or Citizens Information Centre.

All jobseekers have to register for a Public Services Card if they have not
been issued with one already.

Depending on your personal profile, you may be given an appointment for a
further meeting with a DSP case officer. At this meeting your case officer
will discuss your options with you and agree your Personal Progression Plan to
prepare you to find employment. You will get ongoing advice and support to
help you meet the goals in your Personal Progression Plan.

If you do not keep to the conditions of your jobseeker’s payment, your payment
can be reduced and eventually stopped altogether.
