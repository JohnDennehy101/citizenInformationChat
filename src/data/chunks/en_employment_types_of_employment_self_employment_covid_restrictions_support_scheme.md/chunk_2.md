##  Introduction

In Budget 2021, the Government announced a COVID Restrictions Support Scheme
(CRSS) to help support businesses. Generally, this scheme applied when
businesses were significantly restricted from operating due to [ public health
restrictions ](/en/health/covid19/living-with-covid19-plan/) .

Qualifying businesses could apply to Revenue for a cash payment of up to
€5,000 a week.

The scheme ran from 13 October 2020 until 31 January 2022.

**With the removal of public health restrictions from 22 January 2022,
businesses will no longer qualify for the CRSS** . Businesses can claim an
extra restart week payment for the week beginning 24 January 2022, to help
with the costs of reopening fully – see ‘Rates’ below.

This page is a summary of the CRSS rules and operation. You can get more
detailed guidance on the operation of the scheme in [ Revenue’s CRSS
Guidelines (pdf) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/press-office/budget-
