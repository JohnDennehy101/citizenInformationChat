##  How to apply

There is a 2-step process to make a claim under the CRSS.

  1. You must register for the CRSS through [ Revenue’s Online Service (ROS) ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/index.aspx) . You need to give details, such as the business location and the average weekly turnover for 2019 (or 2020 if your business started trading on or after 26 December 2019). Keep all supporting documentation that shows you meet the conditions of the CRSS. Revenue may request this information at a later date. 
  2. You must complete a CRSS claim for a _claim period_ or claim periods. The claim period is the period during which the qualifying COVID-19 restrictions are in place. You can make your claim through the claims portal for CRSS, which is available through the eRepayments system on [ ROS ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/index.aspx) . 

You must make your claim within 8 weeks of the date the claim period starts
(that is the date the restrictions start).

You must make your claim for the restart week payment within 8 weeks of the
date the restrictions are lifted.

You can find details of the start and end dates of claim periods in section
5.5 of [ Revenue’s CRSS Guidelines (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/press-office/budget-
information/2021/crss-guidelines.pdf) .
