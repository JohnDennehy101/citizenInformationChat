##  How is the Seanad elected?

Forty nine of the Seanad’s 60 members are elected and 11 are nominated by the
Taoiseach. Of the 49 elected members, 43 are elected from panels of candidates
representing specified vocational interests. The remaining 6 members are
elected by university graduates of certain universities.

A Seanad election takes place up to 90 days after Dáil Éireann has dissolved.
This means that the new Dáil has assembled before the Seanad election takes
place.
