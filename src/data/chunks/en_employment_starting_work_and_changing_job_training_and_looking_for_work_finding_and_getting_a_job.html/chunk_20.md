###  **Schemes for people getting social welfare payments**

If you have been on jobseeker payments, or certain other social welfare
payments for a certain length of time, you can apply for [ employment support
schemes ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/schemes-to-support-employment/) . These
schemes help people who are long-term unemployed to return to work.

Some schemes, such as the [ Community Employment (CE) scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/) , provide
jobs in the community. Other schemes, such as the [ Back to Work Enterprise
Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/social-welfare-payments-and-work/back-to-work-enterprise-
allowance/) , helps you become self-employed while also keeping some of your
payment.

The [ Training Support Grant (TSG) ](http://www.welfare.ie/en/Pages/Training-
Support-Grant.aspx) is also available for jobseekers who get certain other
payments. The TSG is for short-term training that is not available from
another state provider, or training that will help you to get a job quickly.
