###  **After the interview**

After the interview, you can ask the employer for feedback on your
performance. They donâ€™t have to give you feedback, but they may do so as a
_courtesy_ (politeness).

**Can I see my interview notes?**

If the employer ignores or refuses your informal request for interview
feedback, you have the right to request your interview notes under the [
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ](/en/government-in-ireland/data-
protection/rights-under-general-data-protection-regulation/) .
