###  Harassment

Harassment is “unwanted conduct” relating to any of the 9 grounds of
discrimination (see ‘Introduction’ above). Harassment violates your dignity
and creates an intimidating, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment
for you.

Some examples of harassment include:

  * Verbal harassment, such as making jokes or derogatory (offensive) comments 
  * Written harassment, such as graffiti, text messages, emails, or social media posts 
  * Physical harassment, such as shoving or any other assault 
  * Intimidating behaviour, such as gestures or threatening poses 
  * Visual displays such as posters, emblems or badges 
  * Excessive monitoring of work 
  * Isolation or exclusion from social activities 
  * Unreasonably changing your job content or target.
