##  Introduction

Employers are required to prevent harassment in the workplace.

Your employer may have to pay you compensation if you are harassed at work
because of your:

  * Gender 
  * Civil status 
  * Family status (for example, as a parent) 
  * Sexual orientation 
  * Age 
  * Disability 
  * Race 
  * Religious belief 
  * Membership of the Traveller community 

These are known as the 9 grounds of discrimination (or the _prohibited
grounds_ ).

This is set out under the [ Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015.
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0021/index.html) Under this
law, you are entitled to [ bring a claim to the Workplace Relations Commission
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/disputes-about-equality-and-
discrimination/) (WRC).

If you are being bullied or harassed at work for reasons that are not listed
above, then this is classed as a health and safety issue, rather than an
equality issue. Read about [ how to handle bullying at work
](/en/employment/equality-in-work/bullying-at-work/) .
