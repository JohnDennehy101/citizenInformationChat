###  Taking your complaint further

If you feel your complaint about harassment or sexual harassment has not been
dealt with properly by your employer, you can make a complaint to the
Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) using their [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
.

You must submit your complaint under the Employment Equality Acts **within 6
months** of the last act of harassment. This time limit can be extended by a
further 6 months if there was a “reasonable cause” for the delay.

If you cannot complain effectively because of an intellectual or physiological
disability, then a parent, guardian or other person can complain on your
behalf.
