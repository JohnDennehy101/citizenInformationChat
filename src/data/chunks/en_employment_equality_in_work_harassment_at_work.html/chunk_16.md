##  More information

If you are being harassed or bullied at work, and it is not linked to one of
the 9 grounds of discrimination (see ‘Introduction’ above), then it is a
health and safety issue. Read about [ how to handle bullying at work
](/en/employment/equality-in-work/bullying-at-work/) , or visit the Health and
Safety Authority website for advice on [ bullying at work
](http://www.hsa.ie/eng/Workplace_Health/Bullying_at_Work/Are_you_being_Bullied/)
.

You can also read the [ Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the
Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work (pdf)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/si/674/made/en/print) . It aims to
ensure that workplace bullying is not tolerated and that employers have
procedures for dealing with bullying at work.

The [ Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission ](https://www.ihrec.ie/) has
a general remit to promote equality and can give advice and, in some cases,
legal assistance if you want to bring a claim of harassment under the
Employment Equality Acts.
