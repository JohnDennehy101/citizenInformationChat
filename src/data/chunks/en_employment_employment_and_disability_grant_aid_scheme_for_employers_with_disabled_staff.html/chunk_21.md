###  What the employer needs to do

The employer must complete the [ employer application form (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/47951/d20fc621c0444de59d3a207e31688695.pdf) and [
productivity level report form (pdf) ](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/24695/?page=1) ,
as agreed with the employee.

The employer should send completed forms to their local DSP Intreo Office, or
to the DSP Case Officer dealing with the case if they know who this is. Forms
can be sent by email to the relevant Case Officer, if known.

Employers must also provide a current [ tax clearance certificate
](http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/tax-clearance.html) and a signed [ contract
of employment ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/contracts-of-
employment/contract-of-employment/) detailing the terms and conditions of
employment.

If you are an employer applying for Strand 3 WSS funding, you should complete
the application for Strand III Grant form, which you can get from a DSP Case
Officer. You must also provide supporting documentation â€“ read the [
Operational Guidelines for the Wage Subsidy Scheme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/789802-operational-guidelines-wage-
subsidy-scheme/) for more information.
