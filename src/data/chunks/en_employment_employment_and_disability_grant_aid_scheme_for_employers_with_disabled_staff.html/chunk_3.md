###  How the WSS works

Sometimes, a disability can restrict an employee's productivity compared to
other staff, regardless of their ability to do a job. In this case, the Wage
Subsidy Scheme (WSS) makes up the shortfall in productivity directly to the
employer (who pays the employee as usual).

While it is generally [ illegal to discriminate against an employee based on
disability ](/en/employment/equality-in-work/equality-in-the-workplace/) ,
discrimination on the grounds of disability is allowed if there is clear
evidence the employer would face significantly increased costs if the
discrimination were not permitted.

For this reason, employers who employ staff with disabilities, with proven
productivity rates of 50-80%, will not lose out as the subsidy makes up for
any shortfall in productivity.

Under the scheme:

  * The DSP completes an annual review based on the performance of the employee in the previous 12 months 
  * The employer must complete a productivity assessment form that certifies the employeeâ€™s productivity deficit 
  * The DSP can conduct additional monitoring visits, without notice, to the place of work.
