###  Strand 1

Strand 1 is a wage subsidy payment paid to the employer if an employee with a
disability has a productivity level of between 80% or less (compared to other
staff).

The employee must work at least 15 hours a week. There is some flexibility in
how your weekly work hours are calculated. For example, you can work a minimum
of 10 hours in one week, once you work 84 hours over 4 weeks.

The subsidy is €6.30 an hour for the hours worked. The maximum annual subsidy
is €12,776 based on a 39-hour week.
