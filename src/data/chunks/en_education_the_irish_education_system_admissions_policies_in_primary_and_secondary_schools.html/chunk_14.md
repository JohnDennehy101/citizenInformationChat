##  Applying to more than one school

You can apply to more than one school but you cannot accept more than one
place.

If you accept an offer from one school and you have applied to one or more
other schools, you must tell the school that you are accepting the offer from
about any offers you have or are expecting from the other schools you have
applied to.

You should check the schools admission policy for the rules around how you
should notify the school.

Under the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, school boards of
management can share information with each other about applications received,
offers made and offers accepted.
