####  Reasons a school cannot use for selection

A school cannot take the following reasons into account when selecting
students:

  * A student’s attendance at a pre-school (although they may consider attendance at an early-intervention class or early-start pre-school) 
  * A student’s academic ability, skills or aptitude (although these may be considered in applications for post-leaving certificate courses or further education courses or certain circumstances in special education (see below) 
  * The occupation, financial status, academic ability, skills or aptitudes of a student’s parents 
  * Attendance by the student or their parents at an interview or open day (although an interview may be taken into account for admission to the residential element of a boarding school) 
  * The date and time the application was received by the school as long as it is submitted during the period set in the admission notice)
