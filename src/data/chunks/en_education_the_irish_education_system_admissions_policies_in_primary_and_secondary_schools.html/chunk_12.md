##  Selection criteria for Irish languageschools

Irish language schools can give priority to students who have a reasonable,
age-appropriate level of oral fluency in the Irish language and the school is
satisfied that student's fluency would regress if they were not admitted to
the Irish language school.

An Irish language post-primary school may give priority to students who have
attended an Irish language primary school.
