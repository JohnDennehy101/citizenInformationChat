##  Introduction

You have the right to get copies of records held by public bodies under the
Freedom of Information (FOI) Acts.

This may include:

  * Records that relate to you personally 
  * Any other records created since 21 April 1998 

FOI only applies to **FOI bodies** . These are mostly bodies that are publicly
funded (for example, government departments).

If you want to apply for records that are held about you by a private
organisation, you can [ apply under data protection laws ](/en/government-in-
ireland/data-protection/rights-under-general-data-protection-regulation/) .

FOI allows the public to have information about what the Government is doing
and it is often used by journalists, campaigners and opposition parties.

You can get information that is held about you by public bodies for free in
most cases. In some situations, the information may be redacted or withheld
(see ‘your rights under FOI’ below).

The laws on freedom of information are set out in the Freedom of Information
Act 2014 and its [ amendments and regulations
](https://foi.gov.ie/regulations/) .
