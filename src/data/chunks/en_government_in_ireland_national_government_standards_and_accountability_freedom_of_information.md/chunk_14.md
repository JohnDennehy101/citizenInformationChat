###  Appeals

You can request a review of the decision to refuse your application by writing
to the FOI officer within 3 weeks of the decision (or after 4 weeks from your
FOI request if you have not received a response). The review must be carried
out by a member of staff who is more senior than the person who made the
original decision.
