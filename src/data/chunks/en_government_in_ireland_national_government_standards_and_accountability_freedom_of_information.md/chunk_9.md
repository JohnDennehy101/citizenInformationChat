###  What happens after you make a request?

The FOI body must acknowledge your request within 2 weeks. In most cases, the
FOI body can respond to your request within 4 weeks. The FOI body may ask for
more time to complete your request if, for example, there are a lot of
documents to consider. They must notify you in writing if they wish to extend
the time, and they cannot extend it for more than a further 4 weeks.
