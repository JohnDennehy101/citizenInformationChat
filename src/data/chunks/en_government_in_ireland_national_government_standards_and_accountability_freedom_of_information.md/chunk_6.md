###  Records that are included

You can ask for records under FOI from the date that the Freedom of
Information Act applies to the body concerned. This is known as the ‘
_effective date_ ’. For most bodies, the effective date is 21 April 1998. You
can ask for records from before the effective date if either:

  * The record relates to personal information about you 
  * You need a record from before the effective date to understand later records 

A record can be a paper document or information held on computer. It includes,
for example, printouts, maps, plans, microfilm, audio-visual material, disks
and tapes.
