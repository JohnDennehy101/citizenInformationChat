##  Introduction

A child is defined as a person under 18 years of age, under criminal law in
Ireland.

As children are deemed vulnerable due to their age and level of maturity, the
law has special provisions which protect the personal rights of child suspects
while they are being detained in Garda stations.

These laws place special duties or obligations on the Garda√≠ in their dealings
with child suspects while in the Garda station.
