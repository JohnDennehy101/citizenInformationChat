###  **Summonses to court for a child**

The Gardaí may decide to [ summons ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/summons/) a child to appear in court for an alleged offence. (This is
mostly done in less serious cases involving minor crimes).

The child’s parents or guardian may be named on the summons and, if they are
named, they must attend at the sitting of the court stated in the summons.
