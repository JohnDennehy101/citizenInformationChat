##  Recounts

A recount can be ordered if a candidate asks for one, or if the returning
officer decides that a recount is needed.

A candidate might ask for a recount of a particular count, or round of voting.
This means that the votes that were counted in the last round only are counted
again and corrected if necessary.

A candidate might ask for a total recount, which means that all the votes are
counted as they are at the time of the request. If an error is found, then all
the votes are recounted from the time the mistake happened.

It is possible that candidates that have already been _deemed to be elected_ ,
could have their election overturned because of a recount. A candidate is
deemed to be elected once they reach the quota of votes.

However, once the result is _declared_ , a recount can only happen if it is
ordered by the [ High Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) . A
candidate is declared elected when the total count is complete and the
returning officer has declared the results.
