##  Introduction

When you vote in an election in Ireland, you are asked to give your vote in
order of preference. This is because Ireland uses an electoral system called
_proportional representation with a single transferrable vote_ (PR–STV, or PR
for short).

The names of candidates appear in alphabetical order on the ballot paper,
along with their photographs and their party emblem (if they wish).

You vote by writing “1” opposite your first choice candidate, “2” opposite
your second choice, “3” opposite your third choice, and so on.

You can stop after indicating your first choice candidate or you can continue
to give a preferential vote to as many candidates on the ballot paper as you
wish.

When you vote with more than one preference, you are instructing the r
_eturning officer_ (the person responsible for the counting of votes) that if
your preferred candidate is eliminated, or elected with a surplus of votes,
you want your vote to be transferred to your second choice candidate.

PR is used in all elections in Ireland, including:
