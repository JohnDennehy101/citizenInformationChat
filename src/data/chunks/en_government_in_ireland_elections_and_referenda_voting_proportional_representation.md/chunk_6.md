##  How is the quota calculated?

To be elected, a candidate must generally reach _the quota_ for the
constituency. The last seat can be filled by a candidate who did not reach the
quota if all the other candidates have been elected or eliminated.

The quota is calculated by dividing the total valid poll by 1 more than the
number of available seats (if there is a number to carry over, it is ignored),
and then adding 1.

**For example,** in a 4-seat constituency with a total valid poll of 25,000,
the quota is:

25,000 ( _the total valid poll_ ) divided by 5 ( _1 more than the number of
seats_ ), which is 5,000. Then add 1. The quota is 5,001.
