##  How are candidates eliminated?

If nobody reaches the quota after a round of counting, then the candidate with
the fewest number of votes is eliminated, and all their votes are distributed.

More than one candidate can be eliminated after a round of voting if it is
clear that they cannot be elected, and they cannot qualify to have their
election expenses repaid.
