##  Rules

Under the [ Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order 1981
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1981/si/428/made/en/print) , you can
claim a VAT refund on aids and appliances that help you carry out daily
activities at home or at work. Revenue may ask for medical evidence of your
disability.

VAT refunds are **not** allowed on services or on the rental of aids and
appliances.

To claim a VAT refund you must:

  * Live in Ireland 
  * Have a disability 
  * Need the aid or appliance to help with daily activities 

The aid or appliance must be owned by the person with the disability and be
for their exclusive use. If the VAT refund is being sought by someone other
than the user of the aid or appliance, [ Revenue ](http://www.revenue.ie) may
ask for evidence that the aid is solely owned by the person with the
disability and is for their sole use. In this case, the purchaser must not get
the goods from their own business.

Examples of eligible aids and appliances include:

  * Domestic aids, for example, eating and drinking aids 
  * Walk-in baths 
  * Commode chairs 
  * Lifting seats and specified chairs 
  * Braille books 
  * Hoists and lifts, including stair lifts 
  * Communication aids
