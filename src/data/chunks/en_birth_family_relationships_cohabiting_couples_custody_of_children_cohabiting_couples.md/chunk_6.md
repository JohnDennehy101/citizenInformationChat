###  A court decision

If you do not have automatic rights or cannot reach agreement, you can apply
to the court for custody.

There are 2 main types of custody:

  * **Sole custody** where one parent or person is appointed by the court to be responsible for the child's day-to-day care 
  * **Joint custody** where both parents or two people are appointed by the court to be responsible for the child's day-to-day care
