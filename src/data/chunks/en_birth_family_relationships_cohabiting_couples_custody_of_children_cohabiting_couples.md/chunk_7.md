###  The views of the child

When the court is deciding on a custody order, the most important factor will
be the welfare of the child.

As part of the decision-making process about custody and access, the judge may
order that certain reports are done to find out the views of the child
depending on the age and maturity of the child. This is sometimes known as
‘the voice of the child’. If this happens, the judge may appoint an expert to
write a report for the court about the child’s views and make recommendations.
The report forms part of the decision-making process.

The judge must take the views of the child into account, while always focusing
on the best interests of the child. The best interests of the child may not
always be the same thing as what the child wants, but the child’s view will be
heard.
