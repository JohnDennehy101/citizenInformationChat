###  Social insurance (PRSI) contributions

To qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed), you must pay Class S PRSI.
Class S is the one paid by self-employed people. Class A or H PRSI
contributions can also help you to qualify.

To qualify for Jobseekerâ€™s Benefit (Self-Employed) you need:

  * At least 156 weeks of Class S contributions **or** at least 104 weeks of paid Class A or H PRSI since first starting work 
  * 52 weeks of Class S contributions paid in the relevant tax year. The relevant tax year is the second-last complete tax year before the year in which your claim is made. So, for claims made in 2024, the relevant tax year is 2022.
