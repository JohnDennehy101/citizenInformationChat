##  Rules for Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed)

To qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed) you must:

  * Be aged between 18 and pension age 
  * No longer be self-employed. You must have lost your self-employment involuntarily and not because of a temporary shutdown or seasonal closure. 
  * Be unemployed (you can work as an employee for up to 3 days each week) 
  * Be capable of work 
  * Be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work 
  * Have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions 

**Pension age**

Pension age is 66, but if you [ defer getting your State Pension
(Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/deferring-your-state-pension-
contributory/) to after age 66, you may qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-
Employed) during this period. If you're 66 or over, apply for Jobseeker's
Benefit (Self-Employed) using a paper form from your local Intreo Center or
Social Welfare Branch Office. You will not get credited PRSI contributions
while getting Jobseekerâ€™s Benefit at age 66 or over.
