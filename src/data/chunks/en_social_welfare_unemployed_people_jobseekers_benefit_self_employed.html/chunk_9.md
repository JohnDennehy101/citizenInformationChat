###  Linking claims

If you claim Jobseekerâ€™s Benefit (Self-Employed) for a period, sign off and
then claim it again within 26 weeks, your claim may be linked to the earlier
claim. This means that your claim is not treated as a new claim and:

  * The cumulative total of days from the previous claim is continued (so, for example, if you have used up 100 days of your total entitlement of 234 days you have 134 days remaining on your claim) 
  * The rate is the same rate payable as on the previous claim, unless there has been a budgetary increase or change in family circumstances (such as a new child dependant).
