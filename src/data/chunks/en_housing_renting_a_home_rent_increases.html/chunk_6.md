##  Rent increases outside Rent Pressure Zones

Under [ the Residential Tenancies Act 2004
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2004/en/act/pub/0027/sec0019.html#sec19) ,
landlords cannot charge more than the open market rate of rent. _Market rent_
(for properties outside Rent Pressure Zones) is defined as ‘the rent which a
willing tenant not already in occupation would give and a willing landlord
would take for the dwelling’. The RTB publishes a quarterly [ index of rents
](https://www.rtb.ie/news/rtb-publishes-q1-2022-rent-index) , which you can
use to check current market rents. Read [ more about market rent and the rent
index ](https://www.rtb.ie/beginning-a-tenancy/comparable-market-rents) .
