##  Introduction

The amount of rent you pay for a property is agreed between the landlord and
tenant at the start of a tenancy. Private landlords must follow certain
procedures if they want to raise the rent. The rules are set out in [
residential tenancies legislation
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2004/act/27/front/revised/en/html) .

These rules about rent increases apply to private rented housing. They do not
apply to housing let by [ local authorities ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-
social-housing/) or [ approved housing bodies ](/en/housing/local-authority-
and-social-housing/approved-housing-bodies/) , as they charge differential
rents based on household income. While approved housing bodies come under the
residential tenancies legislation, their rent reviews are carried out in
accordance with their tenancy agreements, or no more than once in any 12-month
period.

Student-specific accommodation comes under the remit of the [ Residential
Tenancies Board (RTB) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-
disputes/residential-tenancies-board/) . This means that student tenancies are
covered by residential tenancies legislation and these tenants have most of
the same rights as private tenants, including that their landlords must follow
the rules about increasing the rent.
