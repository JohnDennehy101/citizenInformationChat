##  Rent increases in Rent Pressure Zones

Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) are areas where rents are highest and rising
quickly. An area must meet [ certain criteria ](https://www.rtb.ie/rent-
pressure-zones) to become an RPZ. In these areas, annual rent increases are
capped.

RPZs were introduced on 24 December 2016. They were to remain in place until
31 December 2024. But, on 14 May 2024, [ the Government agreed to extend them
until 31 December 2025
