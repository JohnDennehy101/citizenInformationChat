####  **Exceptions to rent limits in an RPZ**

There are 3 exceptions to the rent limits applied in Rent Pressure Zones:

  1. Properties that have not been let at any time in the previous 2 years 
  2. Properties in protected structures or proposed protected structures that have not been let in the previous year 
  3. Properties that have been substantially changed. (A ‘substantial change’ in this situation is defined in the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019. The RTB website has details of the types of [ substantial change ](https://www.rtb.ie/news/important-new-changes-to-legislation-affecting-the-rental-sector) required). 

Even if a property qualifies for one of these exemptions, the new rent set
must still be in line with market rent for similar properties in the area.

If a landlord wants to get an exemption from rent limits in an RPZ area, they
must notify the RTB within 1 month of setting the rent by completing the [
RTB’s RPZ Exemption Form (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/forms/Schedule_2_RPZ_Exemption_Form_RTB_%28Revised_Dec_2021%29_Final.pdf)
.

The RTB can [ investigate and sanction ](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-
compliance/investigations-sanctions) landlords who do not comply with RPZ
rules. There are penalties for landlords who do not follow rent increase
limits in RPZs, provide false information about an exemption in an RPZ area or
do not notify the RTB about availing of an exemption.
