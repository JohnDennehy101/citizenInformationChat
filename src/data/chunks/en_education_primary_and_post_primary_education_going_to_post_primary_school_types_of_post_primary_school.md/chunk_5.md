##  Fees for school

**Non-fee-paying schools**  
The majority of post-primary schools in Ireland do not charge fees.

Non-fee-paying voluntary secondary schools, community colleges and community
schools are all funded on an annual budget by the Department of Education.
They get grants from the Department to help with their running costs. The
grants are based on the number of pupils attending the school. If the [ school
is rated as disadvantaged

, it gets an additional grant per pupil.

**Additional school costs**  
If your child attends a non-fee-paying school, they must still pay for books
and examination fees. In addition, they may have other costs, such as school
uniforms. There are [ various schemes to help low-income families meet the
costs of schooling

.

**Fee-paying schools**  
Fee-paying schools do not get any State grants towards their running costs.
However, the State pays the salaries of all teachers working in recognised
voluntary schools. Fees are set each year by the school.
