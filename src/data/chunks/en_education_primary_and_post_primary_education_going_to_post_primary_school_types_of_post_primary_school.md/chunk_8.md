###  Discrimination

Schools cannot discriminate if your child has a disability, is of a different
race or is a member of the Traveller community. Schools cannot discriminate
because of a childâ€™s family status, sexual orientation, marital status, gender
or religion.

However, in some circumstances a school can prioritise a student of a minority
religion who wants a school providing religious instruction similar to their
religion or belief.
