##  Types of post-primary schools

There are 3 types of post-primary or secondary schools:

  * **Voluntary secondary schools**
  * **Community colleges**
  * **Community schools**

Each school type has a different ownership and management. School management
boards must include parents and teacher representatives. In the past, the type
of school usually determined whether the school focus was on academic or
vocational achievements.

Schools must deliver the curriculum set by the Minister of Education. Every
school must have a [ fair policy for handling admissions ](/en/education/the-
irish-education-system/admissions-policies-in-primary-and-secondary-schools/)
and make this information available to parents.

**Voluntary secondary schools** are privately owned and managed post-primary
schools, usually under the patronage of an individual body such as a religious
community, a charitable trust or a private charitable company. The national
representative body for the boards of management of voluntary secondary
schools is the [ Joint Managerial Body ](http://www.jmb.ie/) .

**Community colleges** are established by the local Education and Training
Board (ETB). The ETB is the sole patron of the school. The national
representative body for the Education and Training Boards is the [ Education
and Training Boards Ireland. ](http://www.etbi.ie/)

**Community schools** are established either by one or more private or
religious patrons coming together with an ETB patron or as the result of the
amalgamation of voluntary secondary and ETB schools. The representative body
for the schools is the [ Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools.
