##  How does the pilot scheme work?

The pilot scheme evaluates the impact of a basic income on artists and
creative arts workers. The pilot programme collects and analyses data from BIA
recipients and a control group throughout the pilot.

If you were selected to participate on BIA, you will:

  * Take part in the pilot research programme for 3 years (2022 to 2025) 
  * Engage in ongoing data collection as part of the pilot to determine the impact of the grant payment
