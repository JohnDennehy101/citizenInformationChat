###  The control group

A number of eligible applicants who were not selected to receive the payment
were asked to participate in a control group. Control group participants
respond to the same survey and data requests as those in receipt of the
payment.

If you participate in the control group, you are paid two weeks basic income
for each of the 3 years of the pilot scheme. This means you get 6 weeks of the
BIA payment to compensate you for the time required to engage in the data
collection process.
