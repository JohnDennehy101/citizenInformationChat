##  Water cremation

Water cremation, also known as resomation, is an environmentally friendly
alternative to flame cremation. The process mimics the natural process a body
goes through in burial, as the bodyâ€™s cells are broken down into water but in
a much shorter timeframe.

Water cremation is now [ available in Ireland

you should discuss it with your funeral director.
