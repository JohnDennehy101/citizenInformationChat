##  Rules and regulations

Before cremation can proceed, the doctor that last attended to the deceased
must complete a form. The attending doctor is required to decide whether the [
coroner ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/coroners/) should be notified
of the death.

A medical referee appointed by the crematorium must review this form and
confirm they are satisfied that:

  * The attending doctor viewed the body before and after death 
  * The cause of death has been identified 
  * The case does not need to be referred to the coroner 
  * There is no reason why the body should not be cremated 

There may be difficulties arranging an immediate cremation if the cause of
death is unclear. A coroner may in this case complete a Coroner's Cremation
Certificate which allows the cremation to go ahead. In some cases, a Garda
Superintendent has the power to stop a cremation.

There is currently no specific legislation relating to cremation in Ireland.
In the absence of specific legislation many crematoria have developed their
own codes of ethics that they choose to follow. Mount Jerome Crematorium,
Glasnevin Cemetery and The Island Crematoria have developed [ a code of ethics
](https://www.mountjerome.ie/crematorium/code-of-ethics/) with the assistance
of the [ Institute of Cemetery & Crematorium Management (ICCM)
](https://www.iccm-uk.com/iccm/about-us/) , a UK based organisation. Many
other crematoria, such as Shannon Crematorium, are also committed to following
this code.

You can look on the website of a crematorium to see if they post the code of
ethics they follow, or email them to request more information. Crematoriums
also generally have their code of practice on display so that you can view it
when you visit.
