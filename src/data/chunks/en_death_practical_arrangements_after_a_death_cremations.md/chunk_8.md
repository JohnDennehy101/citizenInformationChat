###  After the service

After the service, the coffin is taken to the crematorium building. The body
is cremated inside the coffin. The coffin must be made of materials than can
be safely burned. It is not necessary for items of jewellery to be removed if
you do not wish to, but it will not be possible to retrieve them after
cremation.

Only one coffin is cremated at a time. The chamber of the cremator is designed
to hold one coffin. The only exception to this is if the family requests that
a mother and a very young child be cremated together. The ashes you receive
will contain the ashes of the coffin as well as the deceased.
