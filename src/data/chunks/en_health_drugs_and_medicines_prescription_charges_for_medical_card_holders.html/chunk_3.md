##  Rules

If your pharmacy is aware of all your family members then you should not pay
more than the maximum per month. A family is defined as you, your spouse or
partner, any children under 16 years of age and any children between 16 and 21
years of age who are in full time education.

You can set your family up as a family group on [ the HSE website
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/medical-cards/prescription-charges-for-medical-
card-holders.html#Family-certificate) and print off a family certificate to
give to your pharmacist. This will show all of the members of your family so
that the pharmacy will not collect charges above the monthly limit.

If you do not have access to the internet you can get assistance from your [
Local Health Office ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) or phone
0818 22 44 78 and they will take the details and send you the certificate.
Your local pharmacist may also be able to help you. You will need to have the
medical card number for each member of your family.

The prescription charges are eligible for [ tax relief for medical expenses
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/taxation-and-medical-
expenses/) .
