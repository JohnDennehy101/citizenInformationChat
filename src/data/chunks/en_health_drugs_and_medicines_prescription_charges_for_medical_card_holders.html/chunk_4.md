###  Refunds if you pay more than the monthly limit

The Health Service Executive (HSE) issues refunds automatically every 6
months, based on the information received from your pharmacy. Refunds are
issued for amounts over €10. Refunds under €10 are carried over to the next
refund payment date.

You can avoid the need for a refund if you and your family visit the same
pharmacy and your pharmacist can identify all of your family members.

If you have a question about refunds you can phone 0818 22 44 78 or email [
