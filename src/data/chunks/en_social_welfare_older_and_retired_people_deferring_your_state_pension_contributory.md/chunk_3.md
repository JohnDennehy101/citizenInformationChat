###  Why would I defer the start date for my State Pension (Contributory)?

During deferral, you can continue to work and make PRSI contributions to:

  * Increase your personal rate of payment, or 
  * Meet the qualifying condition of 520 (10 years) contributions for [ State Pension (Contributory) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) . 

This means that deferring your State Pension (Contributory) can help you to:

  * Qualify for State Pension (Contributory) if you didn't qualify at age 66 
  * Get a higher rate of State Pension (Contributory) than what you would have got at age 66
