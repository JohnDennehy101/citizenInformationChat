###  Private residences

You cannot be convicted of inciting hatred for things you say in a private
residence, unless the words, behaviour or material are heard or seen by
someone outside the residence. You may not be guilty of an offence if you were
in a private residence and had no reason to believe that your words, behaviour
or material would be heard or seen by someone outside.
