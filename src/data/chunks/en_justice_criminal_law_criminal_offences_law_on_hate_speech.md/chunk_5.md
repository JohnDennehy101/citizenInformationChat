###  Who is responsible for broadcasts?

A broadcast is any transmission that is intended to be received by the general
public.

If material that is intended to stir up hatred (or is likely to stir up hatred
even if not intended) is broadcast, all of the following may have committed an
offence:

  * The broadcaster (for example, the TV channel) 
  * The people who produced or directed the broadcast 
  * The person who made the threatening or abusive statement 

The broadcaster, producer or director of the broadcast may be able to avoid
prosecution if the material was not intended to stir up hatred and:

  * They did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that the offending material was in the broadcast or 
  * They could not have removed the offending material for practical reasons 

The producer or director may also be able to avoid prosecution if they can
show they did not know and had no reason to believe that that the item would
be broadcast or that it would be likely to stir up hatred.

The person who made the statement may be able to defend their actions if they
can show that they did not know and had no reason to suspect that the material
would be broadcast, or that the broadcast would stir up hatred.

Any person charged in respect of a broadcast can also use a defence of not
knowing or not having reason to suspect that the material was threatening,
abusive or insulting.
