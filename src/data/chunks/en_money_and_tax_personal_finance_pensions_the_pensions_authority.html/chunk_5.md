###  Making a complaint about a pension provider or scheme

The Pensions Authority can help you if you are concerned about the operation
of your PRSA or occupational pension scheme.

If you have a complaint about your pension that you are unable to resolve with
your PRSA provider (or, in the case of occupational pensions with your
employer, pension administrator or trustees), then you can contact the
Pensions Authority for advice and assistance.

The Pensions Authority can:

  * Act on behalf of pension scheme members and PRSA contributors who have concerns about their pension or PRSA 
  * Investigate the status and conduct of an occupational pension scheme 
  * Prosecute for breaches of the Pensions Acts 
  * Take court action against trustees for the protection of members and their rights.
