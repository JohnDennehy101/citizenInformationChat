###  Children detention schools

Former Industrial Schools and Reformatory Schools were called children
detention schools and were managed by the [ Irish Youth Justice Service
](http://www.iyjs.ie/) which is part of the [ Department of Children and Youth
Affairs. ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-children-and-
youth-affairs/) There were 3 children detention schools which were considered
suitable to detain remanded and committed children. They were:

  * Oberstown Boys School 
  * Oberstown Girls School 
  * Trinity House School 

Male offenders aged 16 to 21 were also sent to places of detention instead of
prison. The main place of detention was St. Partick's Institution, which was
formerly known as Borstal and took male offenders between the ages of 16 and
21. [ St. Patrick's Institution was closed on 7 April 2017
