##  Your legal rights

Under your contract of employment, you have a legal right to be paid on time.
If your employer is regularly late paying your wages you can take steps to
enforce your legal right to be paid on time.

First, you should try to resolve this dispute with your employer, by using any
internal complaint or grievances procedures available. If this does not work
and your employer is still paying you late, you can make a formal complaint to
the [ Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/workplace-relations-commission/) .

At both stages, you should use any supports available, such as a trade union
or your local Citizens Information Centre.
