##  Next steps

If you bring a case to the WRC, the adjudicators may hold a hearing to
investigate it. If your employer objects to a hearing, you should go to the
Labour Court.

Following their investigation, the adjudicators will make a decision. Either
you or your employer can appeal this decision to the Labour Court.

If you are consistently paid late by your employer, you have the option to
resign and claim [ constructive dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/dismissal/constructive-dismissal/) because your employer has
breached the terms of your contract. Before you do this, you should always get
legal advice because proving constructive dismissal can be difficult.
