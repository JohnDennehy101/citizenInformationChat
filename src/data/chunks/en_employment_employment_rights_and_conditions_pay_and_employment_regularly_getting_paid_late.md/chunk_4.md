###  Make a formal complaint

If there is a complaint or grievance procedure at your workplace you should
use this. Your employer should have written grievance and disciplinary
procedures in place under the WRCâ€™s [ Code of Practice: Grievance and
Disciplinary Procedures
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/what_you_should_know/codes_practice/cop3/)
. You should have got a copy of these at the start of your employment.

If you cannot resolve the problem by following your workplace grievance
procedure, or if your employer does not have one, you may have to take your
complaint further.
