###  **Optional extra medical form**

If your child has a Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) _,_ you can ask the
medical professional (or specialist dealing with your child) to complete an
additional medical form called [ DomCare3 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/10306/3dcf07b69a9244868f43232976408830.pdf) .

PDD refers to disorders characterised by delays in the development of social
and communication skills. It includes:

  * Autism 
  * Asperger’s Syndrome 
  * Childhood Disintegrative Disorder 
  * Rett’s Syndrome 

This form is optional, because medical professionals may have already given a
detailed report on your child’s medical condition and care needs. However, if
you do not have a recent report from your child’s medical professional, the
DomCare3 form can be useful.

The completed form will:

  * Explain your child’s conditions 
  * Cover any specific care needs your child might have as a result of their disability 
  * Help the Department’s medical assessor decide on eligibility.
