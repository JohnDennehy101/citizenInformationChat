##  Further supports for carers

You can apply for the [ Carer's Support Grant
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/carers/carers-support-grant/) (formerly called the Respite Care
Grant). This is a payment, you can get every year from the Department of
Social Protection.

The Carer’s Support grant is paid automatically to carers getting [ Carer's
Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-
welfare-payments/carers/carers-allowance/) , [ Carer's Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/carers/carers-benefit/) , or [ Domiciliary Care Allowance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) . If you are not
getting one of these payments, you can still qualify for the Carer’s Support
Grant.

Only one Carer’s Support Grant can be paid for each person getting care.
