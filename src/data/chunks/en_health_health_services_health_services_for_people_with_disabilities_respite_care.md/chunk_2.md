##  What is respite care?

If you are a carer you may need to take breaks. Respite care is when you can
take a break from caring, and the person you care for is looked after by
someone else. It can be covered by family members or an organisation so you
can take a short break, a holiday or a rest. Respite care can be for carers of
older people or people with different disabilities.

Respite care can cover different lengths of time such as:

  * A very short time, for example for an evening 
  * Or a much longer arrangement, for example for a holiday 

Respite care schemes are sometimes called 'Breakaway' or 'Friendship' schemes.
