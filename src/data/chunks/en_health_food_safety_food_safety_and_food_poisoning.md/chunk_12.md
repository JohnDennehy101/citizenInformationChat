###  Analysis of food samples

The [ Public Analyst Laboratory
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/public-analyst-laboratory/) analyses
food samples if there is a complaint.

There is no charge for this if the complaint is submitted through the
Environmental Health Service Offices. There is a fee for food sample analysis
if you submit samples directly to the laboratory. [ Read more about food
