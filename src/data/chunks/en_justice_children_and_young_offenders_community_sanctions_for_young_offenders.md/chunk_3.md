##  When is a community sanction ordered?

The child may be ordered to complete a community sanction if the court thinks
it’s the most suitable way of dealing with the case.

Before making this decision, the court will consider:

  * The probation officer’s report 
  * Evidence of any person the court may have requested 
  * Evidence of a child’s parent, guardian or adult relative if they are present in the court for proceedings 

If the court decides to impose a community sanction, the judge will explain in
a way the child understands:

  * The reason the court is imposing a community sanction 
  * The terms and any conditions of a sanction 
  * Expectation of good conduct by the child 
  * What happens if the child does not comply 
  * The child’s parent or guardian will help the child comply with the sanction 

If the child does not agree to comply with the sanction, the court can deal
with the case in another way.

If a child does not comply with a community sanction or the court revokes or
withdraws the sanction, the court will only order detention if it considers it
the only suitable way of dealing with the child.
