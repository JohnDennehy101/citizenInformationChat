###  **6\. Probation (residential supervision) order**

A court can order that a child lives in a hostel under a residential
supervision order. Generally, the hostel chosen would be reasonably close to
where the child usually lives or to where they go to school, work or attend
training.

However, if a court believes that the child may benefit from a period in a
hostel away from their usual residence, the court can approve this.

The residential supervision order must be less than 1 year. A child, their
parent or guardian, or a probation and welfare officer can apply to the court
to change the order if there is a relevant change in circumstances.
