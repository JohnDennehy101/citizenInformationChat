##  What is a community sanction for a young offender?

When a child is convicted of a crime, detention is considered as a last
resort. The courts will consider alternatives to detention.

The [ Children Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0024/index.html) provides for
a range of community sanctions that can be imposed by a court. The court must
consider that a community sanction is the most suitable way of dealing with
the case.

These sanctions allow a child to remain in the community and stay at school.
The [ Young Persons Probation division of the Probation Service
](http://www.probation.ie/EN/PB/WebPages/WP16000038) oversees the
implementation of most of the community sanctions.

If a child does not comply with a community sanction the case is returned to
the court.

**What happens when the child turns 18?**

Most community sanction orders expire 6 months after the child has reached 18
years of age, if they have not already expired.
