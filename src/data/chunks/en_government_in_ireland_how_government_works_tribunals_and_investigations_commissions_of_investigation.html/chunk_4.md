##  Powers of commissions

Commissions seek the voluntary co-operation of witnesses but have powers to
compel people to give evidence if necessary. They also have powers to search
premises and take documents.

In general, evidence is given in private. Commissions are less like a court of
law than tribunals. The legal representatives of other parties will be present
only if the commission is satisfied that their presence is necessary in the
interests of the investigation and fair procedures. Witnesses may only be
cross-examined if the commission agrees.

The Act provides for guidelines to be prepared by the relevant Minister for
witnessesâ€™ legal costs. A person who obstructs the commission or does not co-
operate could be liable for any additional costs resulting from this.
