##  Free health services

Some health services are free of charge even if you donâ€™t have a medical card.

For example, all [ maternity services ](/en/health/health-
services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-services/) and [
immunisation services ](/en/health/health-services/children-s-
health/vaccinations-for-children/) are free. Your [ local health centre
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) or Local Health Office
will advise you about getting access to these services in your area.

A Local Health Office may have waiting lists for these services and may have
to give priority on the basis of medical need.

If you are pregnant or have small children, your GP may refer you to the local
[ Public Health Nurse ](/en/health/health-services/care-in-your-
community/public-health-nurses/) or you can contact the service directly
yourself through your [ local health centre
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) or [ Local Health
Office ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) .
