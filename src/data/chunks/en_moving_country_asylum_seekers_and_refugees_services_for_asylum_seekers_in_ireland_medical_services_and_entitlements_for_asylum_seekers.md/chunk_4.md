##  Medical screening

A free medical screening service is available to all asylum seekers.

This service is confidential and independent of your application for
international protection (refugee status or subsidiary protection).

The service includes screening for infectious diseases like TB, Hepatitis B,
Hepatitis C and HIV and checking the vaccination needs of you and your family.

Follow-up medical treatment, if you need it, will be provided for you and your
family for free under the medical card scheme.
