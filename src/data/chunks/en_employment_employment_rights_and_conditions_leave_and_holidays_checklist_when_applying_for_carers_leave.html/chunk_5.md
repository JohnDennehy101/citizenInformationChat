###  3\. How much carers leave am I entitled to?

Under the [ Carer’s Leave Act 2001
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2001/act/19/enacted/en/html) , you are
entitled to at least 13 weeks’ carer’s leave up to a maximum of 104 weeks. You
can apply to take it in one continuous period or for a number of shorter
periods. There must be a gap of at least 6 weeks between the periods of
carer’s leave.

If your employer agrees you can take a shorter period of leave. However, your
employer can refuse (if they have good reason) to allow you to take carer's
leave of less than 13 weeks and must give you the reasons for the refusal in
writing.
