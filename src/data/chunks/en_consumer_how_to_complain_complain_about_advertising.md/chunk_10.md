###  **Coimisiún na Meán**

In March 2023, Coimisiún na Meán replaced the Broadcasting Authority of
Ireland (BAI) as the regulator for commercial and public service broadcasting.
Broadcasters must follow [ the BAI Code ](https://www.bai.ie/en/codes-
standards/#al-block-7) (until a new code is developed)  

If you have a complaint about advertising, sponsorship, teleshopping or
product placement on tv or radio in Ireland, you must make your complaint to
the broadcaster first. If you are not happy with the response from the
broadcaster, you can complain to the Coimisiún na Meán. You can get more
information about [ making a complaint ](https://www.bai.ie/en/viewers-
listeners/complaints/) .
