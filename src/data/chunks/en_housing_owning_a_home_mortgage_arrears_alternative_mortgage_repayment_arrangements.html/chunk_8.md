###  Move to an interest-only mortgage or change the way you pay interest

This means you only pay the interest due on your loan and not the capital for
a certain amount of time. You may be offered an interest-only option for under
or over a year.

In some cases, you may be offered a less than interest-only arrangement for a
short period. This may be done if you cannot afford the interest-only
repayments. The difference between this lower amount and the interest-only
repayment amount may be added on to your outstanding mortgage balance when the
alternative repayment arrangement expires.

You may also be offered a fixed repayment option. This is where you pay more
than just the interest, but less than your full capital and interest
repayment, for a fixed period. This means that you pay interest and some
capital towards your mortgage.

All of these short-term alternative repayment arrangements are only suitable
if you think that you will be able to return to meeting your full capital and
interest repayments in the near future.

When the interest-only period ends, your lender will recalculate your mortgage
repayments based on the remaining term and the outstanding mortgage balance.
This means that your repayments will increase, as you now have a shorter term
to pay back the outstanding mortgage balance. If you are offered a long-term
interest-only option, you may need to sell your property to pay the
outstanding mortgage balance when the mortgage term expires.
