##  Can I appeal or make a complaint?

If you are refused an alternative repayment arrangement, or you reject the
arrangement being offered, you can appeal the decision to your lender’s
Appeals Board. The appeal must be decided within 40 business days of being
received. The lender must write to you within 5 business days of this, to tell
you the decision of the Appeals Board and explain the terms of any offer being
made.

If you are not happy with the lender’s treatment of your case, you can
complain to the lender under the [ Central Bank’s Consumer Protection Code
2012 ](https://www.centralbank.ie/docs/default-source/Regulation/consumer-
protection/other-codes-of-conduct/4-gns-4-2-7-cp-code-2012.pdf?sfvrsn=4) .

If you are not happy with the outcome of an appeal or complaint, you can refer
it to the [ Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman ](https://www.fspo.ie/)
.
