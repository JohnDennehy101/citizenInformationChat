##  What other options do I have?

If your lender does not offer you an alternative repayment arrangement, or if
you cannot agree on one being offered, you may need to consider other options.
Your lender must inform you in writing about the options that are available to
you. These may include:

  * Voluntary surrender 
  * Trading down 
  * Mortgage-to-rent 
  * Voluntary sale 

You must be informed of the implications of each option and what will happen
to any outstanding debt. Your lender must also inform you in writing that you
are now outside the MARP, and that repossession proceedings can follow either
3 months from the date the letter is issued or 8 months from the date your
arrears arose, whichever date is later. You must be told about [ personal
insolvency options ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-
insolvency/personal-insolvency-options/) , the importance of taking
independent advice and your right to [ appeal or complain
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-arrears/mortgage-arrears-resolution-
process#l12fa2) .

You may also be able to get advice and support under the [ Abhaile scheme.
