###  How sustainable is the arrangement I am being offered?

To assess whether you can keep up payments for the remaining term of the
mortgage, you need to consider:

  * What might change in your personal situation 
  * If future external changes will affect your ability to repay 

It may be difficult to forecast into the future. But you can assess certain
changes, for example, what level of interest rate increase you could manage.

Things to consider include:

  * Your current and future income. 
  * Your current and future expenditure. 
  * Your age and stage in life. For example, your children may need childcare now or may need support going to college in the future. 
  * Future interest rates and the future value of your assets. 
  * The possibility of inheritances or other lump sums in the future.
