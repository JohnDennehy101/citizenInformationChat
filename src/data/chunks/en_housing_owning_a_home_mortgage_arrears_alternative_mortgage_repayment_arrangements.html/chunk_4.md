###  Can I afford the alternative repayment arrangement?

When assessing if you can afford the proposed repayments, you should consider:

  * Your current net monthly income 
  * All your current monthly outgoings 
  * The net disposable income that you will have left to pay the mortgage 
  * How much your assets are worth 
  * Any other debts you have 
  * If the alternative repayment arrangement offered is a short-term one, whether you will be able to pay the higher repayments when the arrangement ends 

Most lenders have family finance budgeting tools on their websites that can
help you work out if you can afford the arrangement being offered. MABS has a
[ budget tool ](https://mabs.ie/money-tools/my-budget/) and the Insolvency
Service of Ireland (ISI) has a [ reasonable living expenses calculator
](https://backontrack.ie/rle-calculator/) to help you with this. If your
arragement is part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), you will
have completed a [ Standard Financial Statement (pdf)
](http://www.centralbank.ie/consumer/info/documents/industry%20standard%20financial%20statement.pdf)
for your lender. You can use this to review your income and outgoings.
