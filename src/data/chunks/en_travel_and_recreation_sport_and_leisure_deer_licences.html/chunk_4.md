##  Rules for a deer hunting licence

You need a licence to hunt deer in Ireland and can only hunt them for the
period on your licence. The penalties for hunting deer without a licence
include fines, imprisonment, or both.

To apply for a deer hunting licence you must:

  * Be over 16 years old 
  * Sign a declaration verifying that you will only hunt on land where you have permission (set out in Section 28 of the Wildlife Act). 
  * Provide your firearm (gun) details. The legal minimum requirement for a firearm to hunt deer is .220 calibre, with a muzzle energy of more than 1,700 foot pounds, which uses bullets of no less than 55 grain weight. 

You can apply for a licence during the open or closed season but you can only
hunt deer when permitted.
