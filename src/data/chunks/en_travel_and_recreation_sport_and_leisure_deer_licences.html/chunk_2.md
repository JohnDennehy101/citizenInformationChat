##  Introduction

Deer are a protected species in Ireland under the [ Wildlife Act, 1976 (as
amended) ](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1976/act/39/revised/en/html) .
It is a serious offence to hunt them without a licence.

In Ireland, the wild deer population consists of red, fallow, sika, muntjac
and hybrid deer. Conservation rangers employed by the National Parks and
Wildlife Service (NPWS) manage the wild deer population in Ireland's national
parks. The NPWS is part of the Department of Housing, Local Government and
Heritage. Landowners are responsible for the control of wild deer on their
private property.

Applications for deer hunting licences are processed by the NPWS.

Licences are issued for the period from **1 August to 31 July** **and must be
renewed** **annually.** Deer hunting licences are free.

The number of wild deer hunting licences issued by the NPWS changes from year
to year, depending on demand, and the management of the deer population. The
open season for deer hunting (see below) in Ireland changes from year to year
depending on the location and species of deer.

Landowners can apply for a [ Section 42 licence
](https://www.npws.ie/licencesandconsents/disturbance/stop-damage-flora-and-
fauna-wild-animals) to control deer outside of open hunting season if the deer
are causing damage.

From June 2024, you can only [ apply online for a deer hunting licence
