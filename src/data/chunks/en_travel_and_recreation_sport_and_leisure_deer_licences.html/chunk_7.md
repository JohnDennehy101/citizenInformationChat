###  Firearms

All firearms (guns) in Ireland must be registered and licensed. You must give
details of your firearm when you submit your application for a deer hunting
licence. Firearms certificates for weapons to hunt deer are issued by the
Garda Commissioner through your local Garda station. There are important
restrictions on the use and discharge of these dangerous weapons.

Before your local Garda√≠ issue a firearms certificate, they may ask for the
following:

  * Evidence that there is adequate security in your home for a gun 
  * Your [ land folio numbers ](https://www.landregistryireland.com/) (if the weapon is to be discharged on your land) 
  * Your deer hunting licence 

You must meet the requirements [ if you are visiting from another country
](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Non-residents_Shooting_In_Ireland) and
importing a firearm for sporting purposes.

You must ensure that you have the appropriate deer hunting licence and a
firearm of the appropriate calibre. You can be prosecuted for hunting deer
with an inappropriate firearm or by any other means.
