##  Introduction

Arrests normally happen where you are deprived of your liberty in
circumstances where it is suspected that you are committing, have committed or
are about to commit an offence.

You should be told that you are being arrested. However, this is normally
clear if force is being used by a member of An Garda Síochána.

You should be told why you are being arrested, for example, because you are
suspected of having stolen goods. Again, in some cases, this may be clear from
the circumstances of arrest, for example, you are seen running from a shop
carrying goods the shop sells. In those cases, it is not absolutely necessary
for the Gardaí to say why you have been arrested.

The Gardaí do not have to inform you in any particular form the reason and
legal basis for your arrest. However, you do have to be informed in an
understandable way why you are being arrested.

If you go voluntarily to a Garda station to assist the Gardaí with their
enquiries and are subjected to questioning or interrogation, you must be told
and it must be clear to you, that you are free to leave the station at any
time unless you are arrested. However, you may be arrested as a result of
information provided while ‘helping the Gardaí with their enquiries’.

Often an arrest is on foot of a warrant. However, a warrant is not always
necessary.
