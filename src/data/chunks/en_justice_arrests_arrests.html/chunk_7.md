###  Search of the arrested person

A Garda may search you after your arrest and take:

  * articles that they believe to be connected with, or evidence relating to, the offence charged or 
  * articles that they believe to be connected with, or evidence relating to, some other offence or 
  * articles that you might use to injure another person or property or to escape 

Normally, the search will be confined to a body frisk and a search of your
outer clothes. In limited circumstances, a strip search may be justified.
