###  Entry and search of a premises to carry out an arrest

If a Garda has obtained a warrant to arrest you, they may enter and search any
premises where they suspect you to be. They must identify themselves, demand
entry and state why they are there. It is not necessary to show you the
warrant at the time of arrest. However, it must be shown to you soon after the
arrest. If the Garda is refused entry, they may use reasonable force to gain
entry to the premises.

When a Garda does not have an arrest warrant, they may similarly enter and
search any premises (other than a dwelling) where they, with reasonable cause,
suspect you to be, if it relates to an arrestable offence.

However, if the premises is a dwelling, the Garda cannot enter for the purpose
of arresting someone for an arrestable offence unless:

  * The Garda has the permission of the person who lives in the dwelling 
  * You ordinarily live at the dwelling 
  * A member of An Garda SÃ­ochana has seen you inside or entering the dwelling 
  * The Garda, with reasonable cause, suspects that before they can get an arrest warrant, you will either abscond or you will obstruct the course of justice 
  * The Garda, with reasonable cause, suspects that before they can get an arrest warrant, you will commit an arrestable offence
