###  **If the content is not taken down**

Online platforms must act quickly on reports they receive. If the platform
does not delete the content or respond to you, you have options for redress
(ways to solve the issue).

The first step is to use the platform's internal complaint system within 6
months of the decision.

If you believe a provider has not met its obligations, you can make a
complaint to Coimisiún na Meán.
