###  **Who can make a complaint?**

You can make a complaint as a:

  * Member of the public 
  * An organisation acting on behalf of a user 
  * Trusted flagger 

A trusted flagger is an organisation given special status based on its
expertise and competence in reporting illegal content such as [ the Irish
Network Against Racism ](https://inar.ie/hate-speech-monitoring/) .

Online platforms must prioritise complaints made by trusted flaggers.
Coimisiún na Meán has more information about [ trusted flaggers
