###  Hardship meters

If you have an older pre-pay meter that has a pre-pay limit, you may have to
redeem each of your electricity credits over separate top-ups (vends), over
the space of a few days.

To redeem your credits, you pay €10 towards your electricity. Your credit is
automatically added to the top-up. **You should allow one day between each €10
payment.**

**Number of top-ups:** |  **Amount you should pay:** |  **Amount of credit automatically applied to your €10**  
---|---|---  
First top-up  |  €10  |  €50   
Second top-up  |  €10  |  €50   
Third top-up  |  €10  |  €50   
  
You need to repeat the process above for each of the 3 €150 credits.
