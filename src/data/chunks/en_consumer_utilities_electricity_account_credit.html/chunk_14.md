##  If I don’t get the credit

Suppliers will have information on their websites with the exact dates the
credit will show on their customers’ bills.

**Bill pay customer:** the first credit will be applied to your account in
December. You should notice the credit on your next bill. Once you receive the
bill, check for the credit. If it’s not there, contact your electricity
supplier.

**Prepay customer:** contact your electricity supplier if you have not
received the first credit by 31 December 2023.

You can find the contact details for your electricity supplier on your most
recent bill or statement.
