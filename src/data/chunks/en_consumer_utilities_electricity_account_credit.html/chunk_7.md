##  I use pre-pay electricity

Your supplier contacts you by text, email or on your top-up note to tell you
the credit has been applied to your account.

Most pre-pay electricity meters accept each of the â‚¬150 credits in full.

Your supplier should give you specific instructions on how to redeem your
credits.
