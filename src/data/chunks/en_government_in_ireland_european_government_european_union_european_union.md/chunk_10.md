##  Member states of the EU

The EU currently has 27 member states. The table below shows how the
organisation has grown in size since the _European Economic Community_ (EEC)
was founded in 1957, and has information about the major changes that have
taken place during that time.

Apart from the 27 EU member states, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are also
part of the single market (the EU 27, plus **Norway** , **Iceland** and
**Liechtenstein** form the _European Economic Area_ (EEA))

**Switzerland** and the EU have a bilateral agreement (called the _AFMP_ )
which gives the right for Swiss and EU citizens to move freely in each other’s
territory. In other words, Swiss citizens can live and work in the EU, and EU
citizens can live and work in Switzerland. Switzerland also takes part in
other aspects of the Single Market through various bilateral treaties.
