##  Joining and leaving the EU

A state wishing to join the EU submits a membership application to the Council
of the European Union, which asks the European Commission to assess the
applicant’s ability to meet the [ conditions for membership (Copenhagen
criteria) ](https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-
enlargement/policy/glossary/terms/accession-criteria_en) .

If the Commission’s opinion is positive, the Council of the European Union
must then agree upon a negotiating mandate. Negotiations are then formally
opened.

[ Information on the steps towards joining the EU
](https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/policy/steps-towards-
joining_en) is available on the European Commission’s website.

Under [ Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A12012M050) any member state
may decide to withdraw from the EU. The member state must notify the European
Council of its intention. The EU must negotiate an agreement with the member
state, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the
framework for its future relationship with the EU.

The agreement is concluded on behalf of the EU by the Council of the European
Union, if it has the approval of a qualified majority of the member states,
not including the member state that is leaving. The qualified majority must be
at least 72% of the members of the Council of the European Union and
representing at least 65% of the population of the member states.

The EU treaties cease to apply to the member state from the date of entry into
force of the withdrawal agreement or, if there is no agreement, 2 years after
the original notification, unless the European Council unanimously decides to
extend this period.
