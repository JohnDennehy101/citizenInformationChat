##  EU law

The EU has the power to make laws in defined areas, and these laws take
_primacy_ over national law. This means that Ireland must follow EU laws and
decisions of the [ Court of Justice of the EU ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-court-of-justice/) which
affect Irish law.

  * _Treaties_ are the most important EU laws, and are agreed by member states. Treaties set out how the EU should operate, and give powers to EU institutions to carry out their functions, including creating new laws. 
  * _Regulations_ are laws that apply to all member states (they have direct effect). They become part of national law and can be enforced through the national courts of each member state from the time they come into force. 
  * _Directives_ are laws that set goals for member states to implement. Member states can introduce laws that transpose directives into national law. Directives normally have deadlines for countries to adopt them into national law. 
  * _Decisions_ are only relevant to specified bodies. For example, the EU Commission might issue a decision that Ireland is acting in breach of EU law. The decision has a direct effect on the country, company or organisation that the decision is issued against. 
  * _Recommendations_ and _Opinions_ are not binding, and EU member states can follow the advice of these recommendations if they wish to or they can choose not to change anything.
