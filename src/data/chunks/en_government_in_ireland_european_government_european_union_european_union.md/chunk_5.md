##  EU institutions

The EU has many institutions, but the most important are the institutions that
can make laws that affect member states and citizens.

  * [ The European Parliament ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-parliament/) is the directly elected law-making body of the EU. 
  * [ The Council of the European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/council-of-the-european-union/) represents the governments of the member states. 
  * [ The European Commission ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-commission/) is the executive of the EU. It is responsible for proposing new legislation and making sure that member states follow EU law. 
  * [ The Court of Justice of the European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-court-of-justice/) interprets EU law and settles legal disputes. Decisions of the CJEU are binding on member states. 
  * [ The European Council ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-council/) makes decision about the policy direction of the EU, but does not have the power to pass laws.
