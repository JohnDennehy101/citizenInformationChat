##  Introduction

The European Union ( **EU** ) is a political and economic union of certain
European states. There are currently 27 member states of the EU.

Ireland has been a member of the EU since 1973, and is part of [ the euro area
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/euro-area/) .
Irish citizens are also EU citizens.

The **EEA** is an area of free trade and free movement of people made up of
the member states of the EU, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
Switzerland has an agreement that extends the single market to include it,
though it is not part of the EEA. Ireland, along with the countries in the EU
and EEA are part of _the single market_ .

This means that Irish citizens have the right:

  * To live and work in another EU/EEA country 
  * To move money between countries of the EU/EEA 
  * To sell and buy goods in other EU/EEA countries 
  * To receive and provide services in other EU/EEA countries 

These are known as the _‘4 freedoms’._

Ireland must follow [ EU law ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/eu-law/how-eu-law-works/) , and must conform to the rules and
standards that have been agreed between member states through treaties,
legislation and directives.

This document provides an overview of how the EU works and the rights of its
citizens.
