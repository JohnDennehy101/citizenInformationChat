##  Right to a minimum payment

You must get a minimum payment if you are called in to work but sent home
without work. You must get pay for 25% of the possible hours or for 15 hours,
whichever is less. This rule does not apply to emergencies, exceptional
circumstances or short-term relief.

Your pay should be calculated as either 3 times the national minimum wage or 3
times the minimum hourly rate in an [ Employment Regulation Order (ERO)
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/industrial-relations-and-
trade-unions/employment-agreements-and-orders/) (if applicable).

An employee under a zero-hours contract who works less than 25% of their
potential hours in any week should be paid. The level of pay depends on
whether you got some work or no work.
