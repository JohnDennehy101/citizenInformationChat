##  Rules

Funding will only be reimbursed for healthcare that is publicly funded and
available in Ireland but the referral may be to a public or private health
service in the other country. You pay the costs of treatment and then apply
for a refund when you return to Ireland.

Examples of healthcare that is available under the scheme include:

  * Day, in-patient and out-patient care in acute hospital services, including psychiatric services 
  * Community-based out-patient care 
  * Dental and orthodontic services (with some exceptions, such as dental screening services in schools) 
  * Speech and language services 
  * Occupational therapy services (with some exceptions, such as assessment for aids at home) 
  * Psychology services 
  * Physiotherapy services 
  * Disability services 
  * Ophthalmic services 
  * Mental health services 
  * Methadone programme 
  * Addiction care 

Some health services are not included, for example, organ transplantation and
long-term care such as nursing home care.
