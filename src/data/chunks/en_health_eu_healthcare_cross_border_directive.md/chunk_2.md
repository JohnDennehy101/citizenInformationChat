##  Introduction

If you are entitled to public health services in Ireland, you may choose to
access those services in another member state of the [ European Union (EU)
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/european-
union/) or European Economic Area (EEA), which also includes Iceland,
Liechtenstein and Norway, and be repaid the cost if you meet the requirements.
This is provided for by the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive ( [ EU Directive
2011/24/EU, pdf ](http://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:088:0045:0065:en:PDF) ).

You will be repaid the cost of the public healthcare treatment in Ireland, or
the cost of your treatment abroad, if that is less. It does not include other
costs such as travel.

Treatments that qualify for the [ Treatment Abroad Scheme ](/en/health/eu-
healthcare/treatment-abroad-scheme/) are not covered under the Cross-Border
Healthcare Directive. The Treatment Abroad Scheme covers treatments that are
not available in Ireland while the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive only
covers treatments that are publicly funded and available in Ireland. [ Read
