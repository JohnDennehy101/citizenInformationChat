###  Applying for a refund of costs

To get a refund of the costs that you pay for your treatment, you and your
healthcare provider abroad must complete the [ HSE Cross-Border Healthcare
Directive Pro-Forma Invoice (pdf)
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/appreimbursement/HSE_Cross_Border_Directive_Pro-
Forma_Invoice.pdf) and submit it with the invoice from the healthcare provider
and receipt.

The refund will only be made to the patient (or to the parents of a child
patient).

The HSE has published the [ refund amounts for different treatments
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cross-border-
directive/appreimbursement/) . Treatments are listed according to a code – you
can get the code for your treatment from the healthcare professional who has
referred you. If you prefer, or if your treatment is not listed, you can get
details of the refund rates from the [ National Contact Point
](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/schemes/cbd/contact/) .

The maximum refund for a hospital outpatient consultation is €130. If you have
more than one consultation on the same day with consultants in the same
speciality, the daily limit is €130.

For in-patient treatment, the [ charges for public in-patients in public
hospitals in Ireland ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-
services/hospital-charges/) will apply. These charges will be deducted from
the amount of the refund.
