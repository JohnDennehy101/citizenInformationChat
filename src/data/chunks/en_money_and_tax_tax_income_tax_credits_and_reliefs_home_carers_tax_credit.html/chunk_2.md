##  Introduction

If you are married or in a civil partnership and you care for a dependent
person, you can apply for the Home Carer Tax Credit. You must be [ jointly
assessed for tax ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/taxation-of-married-people/#0b1920) as a couple.

When you get a tax credit, it reduces the tax you pay by the amount of the
credit.
