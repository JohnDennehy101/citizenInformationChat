##  Rates

The Home Carer Tax Credit is €1,800 (€1,700 in 2023).

If the home carer has an income of up to €7,200 in their own right for the tax
year, the full tax credit may be claimed.

**Reduced tax credit**

If the home carer's income exceeds €7,200, the amount of their income over
€7,200 is halved and the tax credit is reduced by that amount. The following
table gives examples of how the tax credit is calculated for different levels
of income in 2024.

If the home carer's income is €10,800 or more, then you cannot claim the tax
credit.
