##  Rules

The full amount of the Home Carer Tax Credit can be claimed when:

  * A married couple or civil partners are jointly assessed for tax 
  * One spouse or civil partner cares for one or more dependent people (see below) 
  * The home carer’s own income is under €7,200. A reduced tax credit applies if their income is between €7,200 and €10,800 (€10,600 in 2023). 

[ Carer’s Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-allowance/) or [
Carer's Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/carers/carers-benefit/) are **not** taken
into account when determining the home carer’s income but they are taxable
sources of income. This means that if you are claiming Carer's Allowance or
Carer's Benefit, it will make up part of your jointly assessed income.
