###  Part-time employees

If you work for your employer for at least 40 hours in the 5 weeks before the
public holiday and it falls on a **day you normally work** , you get paid for
the day even if you don’t work. If you have to work that day, you are entitled
to an extra day's pay.

If you **don’t normally work** on a certain day but it’s a public holiday, you
should get paid one-fifth of your weekly pay. Even if you never work on public
holidays, you still get paid a fifth of your weekly pay as compensation for
the public holiday. Again, you must have worked for your employer for at least
40 hours in the 5 weeks before the public holiday.

You can count time spent on annual leave as ‘time worked’ when calculating the
40 hours worked in the 5 weeks before the public holiday.
