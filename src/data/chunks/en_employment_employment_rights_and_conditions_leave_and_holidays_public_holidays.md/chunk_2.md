##  Introduction

There are 10 public holidays in Ireland each year (increased from 9 in 2022).

Public holidays may commemorate a special day or other event, for example,
Saint Patrick's Day (17 March) or Christmas Day (25 December).

**Since 2023** , there has been a new annual public holiday in early February
to mark St Brigid’s Day. The public holiday is the first Monday in February,
except where St Brigid’s Day (1 February) happens to fall on a Friday, in
which case Friday 1 February will be a public holiday.

On a public holiday, sometimes called a _bank holiday_ , most businesses and
schools close. Other services (for example, public transport) still operate
but often have restricted schedules.
