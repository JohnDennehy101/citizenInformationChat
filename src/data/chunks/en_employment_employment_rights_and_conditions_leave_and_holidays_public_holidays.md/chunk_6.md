##  Public holidays and your entitlements

Most employees are entitled to paid leave on public holidays. Full-time
workers have immediate entitlement to benefit for public holidays and part-
time workers have entitlement to benefit when they have worked a total of 40
hours in the previous 5 weeks. Read about ‘Part-time employees’ below.

If you qualify for public holiday benefit, you are entitled to one of the
following:

  * A paid day off on the public holiday 
  * An additional day of annual leave 
  * An additional day's pay 
  * A paid day off within a month of the public holiday 

You can ask your employer at least 21 days before a public holiday, which of
the alternatives will apply. If your employer does not respond at least 14
days before the public holiday, you are entitled to take the actual public
holiday as a paid day off.

Your public holiday entitlements are set out in the [ Organisation of Working
Time Act 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0020/index.html) . You can
also read about the appropriate rate of daily pay in the [ Organisation of
Working Time (Determination of Pay For Holidays) Regulations (SI 475/1997)
