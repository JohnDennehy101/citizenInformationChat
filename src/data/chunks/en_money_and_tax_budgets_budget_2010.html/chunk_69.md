###  Adult and further education

The number of places provided in Senior Traveller Training Centres (STTCs)
will be reduced from 984 places to 684 places. This is in line with the
Traveller Education Strategy. Travellers can continue to access the full range
of adult and further education programmes across the country.

Allowances to participants in VTOS, Youthreach and STTCs will be reduced in
line with the appropriate social welfare rates or F√ÅS trainee allowances.
