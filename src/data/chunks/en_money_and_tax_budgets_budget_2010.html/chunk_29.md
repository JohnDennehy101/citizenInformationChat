The following package of measures will be introduced in January 2010:

A Car Scrappage Scheme is being introduced with effect from 1 January 2010, to

The existing VRT exemption for series production electric vehicles and the VRT
relief of up to €2,500 for series production plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
(both of which are due to expire on 31 December 2010) are being extended for 2
years until 31 December 2012.
