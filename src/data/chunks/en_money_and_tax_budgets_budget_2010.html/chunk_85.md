##  Voluntary and community sector  

  * Continued support for communities through local and community development programmes, supports for volunteering, for locally-based community and voluntary groups and the Community Services Programme. 
  * A revised Scheme of Community Support for Older People will be introduced early in 2010, which will provide security equipment for upwards of 9,000 older people. Sixty four organisations will continue to receive funding under the Scheme to Support National Organisations in the Community and Voluntary Sector, as will the 21 volunteer centres and other volunteering initiatives. 
  * Employment levels will be maintained at existing levels in 450 community projects under the Community Services Programme (CSP) by requiring projects to generate additional resources from their operations.

  * Capital funding of €33m (including Údarás na Gaeltachta) is being provided for the Gaeltacht and Islands in 2010. This allocation includes investment in marine works, road improvements, access to the islands and water schemes. 
  * Continued support for language development programmes under Ciste na Gaeilge and the Advanced Irish Language Skills Initiative for third-level institutions. Capital funding of €0.6m will facilitate the expansion of Irish language social and cultural centres in the main urban areas.
