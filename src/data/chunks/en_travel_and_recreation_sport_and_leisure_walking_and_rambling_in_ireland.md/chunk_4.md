###  Waymarked Trails

The [ National Trails Office (NTO) of Sport Ireland
](https://www.sportireland.ie/outdoors/find-your-trails) is responsible for
the Waymarked Trails in Ireland. There are over 40 National Waymarked Trails
around Ireland, including the Wicklow Way, Kerry Way, Burren Way, and there
are many shorter walks.

You can find [ Irish walking trails on the Sports Ireland website
](https://www.sportireland.ie/outdoors/walking/trails) .

Waymarked Trails are paths that are developed with the agreement and support
of landowners whose lands are crossed on the route. They are not necessarily
rights-of-way, although old roads and paths are used on many of these walking
routes, which are all waymarked and signposted.

The [ Walks Scheme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/942b4b-the-
walks-scheme-and-rural-recreation-officers/#2021-review-of-the-walks-scheme)
is a national scheme, funded by the Department of Rural and Community
Development. Landholders can get a payment for the maintenance of the National
Waymarked Ways and priority trails that pass through their land. You can find
a [ list of walks and trails ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/af6a41-walks-
scheme-walks-and-trails/) that are available.
