###  Slí na Sláinte

[ Slí na Sláinte ](https://irishheart.ie/your-health/our-health-
programmes/healthy-communities/slainte/) , meaning "Path to Health", is a
scheme developed by the Irish Heart Foundation to encourage people of all ages
and abilities to walk for leisure and good health. For health benefits you
need to walk at a brisk pace for at least 30 minutes, 5 days a week. You can
accumulate 30 minutes or more over 2 or 3 shorter sessions.

It uses signage at kilometre intervals on established walking routes to help
walkers identify the distance they walk. The signs are not numbered so you can
start and finish at whatever kilometre sign you like.
