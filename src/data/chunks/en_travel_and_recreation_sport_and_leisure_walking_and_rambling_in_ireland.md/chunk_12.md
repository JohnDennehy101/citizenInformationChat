###  Extinguishing public rights of way

Under the [ Roads Act 1993
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0014/index.html) , it is the
responsibility of [ local authorities ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-
government-works/local-and-regional-government/functions-of-local-
authorities/) to protect the public's right to access public rights of way in
each local authority area. Local authorities can also extinguish public rights
of way. The procedure that must be followed, if they wish to extinguish a
public right of way, is set out in [ Section 73 of the Act
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0014/sec0073.html#sec73) .

The [ Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2015
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_2000_0030.HTM)
require local authorities to preserve existing public rights of way by mapping
and listing them as part of their county development plans. Under Part XIII of
the 2000 Act, they have the powers to create a public right of way.
