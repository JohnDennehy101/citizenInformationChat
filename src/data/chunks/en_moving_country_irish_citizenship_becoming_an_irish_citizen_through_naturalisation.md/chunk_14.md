##  Documentation

The supporting documents you need depend on your situation. If your documents
are in a language other than English, you must get them translated by a
professional translating service. The [ Irish Translators’ and Interpreters’
Association ](https://www.translatorsassociation.ie/) has a list of
professional translators.

In all cases, you will need to provide evidence of your identity and
nationality.

From 20 April 2023, new applicants are only required to provide a certified
colour photocopy of the biometric page of their current passport. Your
photocopy must be certified by a solicitor, commissioner for oaths, peace
commissioner or a notary public. The ISD can still ask you to submit your full
passport – it is expected that 10% of applicants will be asked to submit their
full passport.
