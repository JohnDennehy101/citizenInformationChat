###  Residence in the State

You must have lived in the State for a certain length of time. The specific
requirements are that you:

  * Have a period of 1 year continuous _reckonable residence_ in the State immediately before the date of your application for naturalisation **and**
  * During the 8 years before that, have had a total reckonable residence in the State of 4 years 

You can spend 70 days outside of Ireland in the year immediately before your
application. The day you leave Ireland, and the day you arrived back in
Ireland, are not counted as absences.

An additional period of up to 30 days may be allowed if you left Ireland due
to _exceptional circumstances_ , for example, health reasons, family
circumstances, employment or study. You should explain this in your
application.

Altogether you must have 5 years reckonable residence out of the last 9 years.

The residency rules for children are different. You can find out more about

Minister’s power to waive conditions’ below).
