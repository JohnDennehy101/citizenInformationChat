###  Calculating reckonable residence

_Reckonable residence_ means residence in Ireland that counts towards becoming
eligible to apply for naturalisation. If your application is based on your
marriage or civil partnership with an Irish citizen, you can count legal
residence in Northern Ireland too.

If you are from outside the EEA, the UK and Switzerland, certain periods of
residence are counted towards the reckonable residence you need to qualify for
naturalisation. Some examples of periods that **are** counted for reckonable
residence include:

  * Time spent in Ireland on an [ employment permit ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/overview-employment-permits/) (usually with a [ Stamp 1 ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/information-on-registering/immigration-permission-stamps/#e3eb99ab1ad6db20e) Irish Residence Permit) 
  * Time spent on a [ Stamp 4 ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/information-on-registering/immigration-permission-stamps/#stamp-categories)
  * Time spent as the dependent of an employment permit or other legal resident (usually with [ Stamp 3 ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/information-on-registering/immigration-permission-stamps/#stamp-categories) ) 
  * Time spent as the spouse or partner of a Critical Skills Employment Permit holder, General Employment Permit holder, Inter-Country Transfer employment permit holder or on the Third Level Graduate Scheme (with [ Stamp 1G ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/information-on-registering/immigration-permission-stamps/) ) 
  * Time spent on a [ Stamp 5 ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/information-on-registering/immigration-permission-stamps/#stamp-categories) (Without Condition as to Time) 

Periods of residence that **are not** reckonable include:

  * Time spent on a student visa (usually with a [ Stamp 2 ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/registering-your-immigration-permission/information-on-registering/immigration-permission-stamps/#stamp-categories) or Stamp 2A IRP) unless you are making an application as a ‘young adult’ (see below) 
  * Time spent in Ireland while you were undocumented 
  * Time spent while you were an [ international protection applicant ](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/applying-for-refugee-status-in-ireland/)

You can use the [ online residency calculator
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/naturalisation-residency-calculator/) on the
Immigration Service Delivery website to check if you meet the naturalisation
residency conditions. You must send a printout from the calculator with your
application (along with other proofs of residence) unless you are a UK, Swiss
or EEA citizen, or have refugee status in Ireland.

Registration with immigration is usually the evidence of legal residence which
meets the residency requirements for naturalisation. You can count the time
when your immigration permission was automatically extended during COVID-19 as
reckonable if you had reckonable residence immediately before the first
extension. For example, if you had a Stamp 4 in March 2020, your Stamp 4
permission was automatically extended until 31 May 2022. This period counts as
reckonable residence. You must also prove that you were actually resident in
Ireland during this time (see ‘scorecard system’ in the section
‘Documentation’ below).
