##  Citizenship ceremonies

If you have been approved for naturalisation, you are normally invited to
attend a citizenship ceremony. At the ceremony, you make a declaration of
fidelity and loyalty. You then receive your naturalisation certificate.

You can read about [ what happens at a citizenship ceremony

Once you have received your naturalisation citizenship, you are an Irish
citizen. You can [ apply for an Irish passport ](/en/travel-and-
