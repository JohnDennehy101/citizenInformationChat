###  If your application is not successful

If your application is refused, you will be given a reason for the decision.
You cannot appeal this decision.

You can apply again if you wish.

If you think that ISD acted unfairly in how it processed your application, you
could apply to the High Court for a [ judicial review ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/judicial-review-
public-decisions/) . You should get legal advice before making an application
to court.

If your refusal was based on national security concerns, you can ask for a
decision on the disclosure of the information relied on for this decision. A [
Single Person Committee ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/single-person-
committee-of-inquiry-set-up-to-review-refusals-of-irish-citizenship-where-
national-security-concerns-arise/) can review the information and recommend to
the Minister for Justice whether or not some or all of the information used to
make the decision can be released to you.

This is not an appeal of the decision.
