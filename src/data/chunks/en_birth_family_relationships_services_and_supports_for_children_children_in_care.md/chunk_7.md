###  Care order

Tusla must apply for a care order if a child needs care and protection which
they are unlikely to receive without an order.

When a care order is made the child remains in the care of Tusla for the
length of time specified by the order, or until the age of 18 when they are no
longer a child. Tusla has the rights and duties of a parent during this time.
A care order can be renewed.

The District Court may make an interim care order while waiting for a decision
on a full care order. If an interim care order is granted, this means that the
child is placed in the care of Tusla for 28 days. It may be extended if Tusla
and the parents agree.
