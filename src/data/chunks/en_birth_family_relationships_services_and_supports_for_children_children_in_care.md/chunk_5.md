##  Care orders

In some circumstances, where it appears that a child is not receiving adequate
care or protection, Tusla may apply to the court for an order. There are
different types of orders Tusla can apply for depending on the type of care
necessary:

**Type of order** |  **Maximum duration**  
---|---  
Emergency care order  |  8 days (cannot be renewed)   
Interim care order  |  28 days (can be extended)   
Care order  |  Permanent or temporary and can continue up to age 18   
Supervision order  |  12 months (can be renewed)   
Interim special care order  |  28 days (can be extended)   
Special care order  |  3 months (can be extended)   
  
The orders give Tusla a range of powers including making decisions about:

  * The kind of care necessary 
  * Access to the child or children for parents and other relatives
