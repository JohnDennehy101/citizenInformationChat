##  Voluntary care

If a child needs care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home,
then Tusla must take them into care. This may happen, for example, in the case
of an orphan or an abandoned child.

In other cases where parents are unable to cope due to illness or other
problems, they may agree to their children being taken into the care of Tusla.
This is known as voluntary care. In these cases, while Tusla has care of the
children, Tusla must consider the parents' wishes as to how the care is
provided.
