####  Re-qualification for EWSS

You can re-qualify for EWSS if your business had a 30% reduction in turnover
or customer orders during a particular reference period:

  * If your business was set up on or before 30 April 2019, the business must anticipate that the combined turnover for December 2021 and January 2022 will be down by at least 30%, compared with the combined turnover for December 2019 and January 2020. 
  * If your business was set up between 1 May 2019 and 31 December 2021, the business must anticipate that the average monthly turnover for December 2021 and January 2022 will be down by at least 30%, compared with the average monthly turnover from August 2021 to November 2021 

If you have a more complex business structure and need help determining your
eligibility for the scheme, you can get further guidance in Appendix I of [
