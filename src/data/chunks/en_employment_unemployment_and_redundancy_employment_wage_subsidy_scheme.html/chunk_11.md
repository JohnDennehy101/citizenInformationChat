###  Eligible employees

The scheme was available for employers who keep staff on their payroll during
the period of the scheme.

There were no restrictions on taking on new employees or moving employees
under a transfer of undertaking, once these are undertaken for legitimate
business reasons and not to maximise subsidy claims.

Employees could be:

  * Temporarily not working or 
  * On reduced hours or reduced pay (or both) 

An employee who is receiving a EWSS payment and whose work is reduced to 3
days or less per week, may be entitled to [ Short Time Work Support
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/c20e1b-short-time-work-support/) which is a
form of [ Jobseeker’s Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) .

An eligible employer must be paying gross wages between €151.50 and €1,462
gross per week to qualify for EWSS ( **see Rates below** ).

Certain categories of employees were excluded from the EWSS. These were:

  * Proprietary directors (with certain exceptions – see below) 
  * Connected parties who were not on the payroll and paid at any time between July 2019 and June 2020 (Certain exceptions apply). See [ Revenue’s website ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/employing-people/ewss/eligible-employees.aspx) for details. 

You could claim the subsidy for proprietary directors if:

  * You met the eligibility criteria for the EWSS 
  * The proprietary director was on your payroll 
  * You paid wages to the proprietary director which were reported to Revenue on your payroll between 1 July 2019 and 30 June 2020 

Where a person is a proprietary director of 2 or more eligible companies, a
claim for the EWSS could only be submitted for a single company.

You can read additional guidance on eligible employees and excluded categories

guidelines.pdf) .
