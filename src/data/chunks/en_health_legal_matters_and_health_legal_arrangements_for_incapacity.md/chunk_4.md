##  Agency arrangements

If you appoint another person to represent you in certain dealings with third
parties, you are making an agency arrangement. You are called the principal
and the person you appoint is called the agent or appointed representative.
The most usual example is where a pensioner nominates someone to collect
social welfare pension payments or other allowances from the post office.

Another example of an agency arrangement is where you appoint a friend or
family member as an agent to manage your financial affairs or pay bills while
you are abroad for a period. You may appoint a professional to do these things
and pay for the service â€“ this is not an agency arrangement but is a contract
for services.

If you are physically incapacitated, your bank may allow you to carry out a
third-party mandate. This authorises your agent to perform certain functions,
for example, to write cheques on your behalf.

You may only make an agency arrangement while you are mentally competent and
the arrangement usually only lasts while you remain mentally competent. The
arrangement does not have to be in writing unless the agent is required to
sell property on your behalf. It is advisable to put the arrangement in
writing so that both you and the agent are clear about what is intended and
what powers the agent has.
