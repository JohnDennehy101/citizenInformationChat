###  **If you are not able to manage your financial affairs**

If you are not able to manage your financial affairs, an agent may be
appointed to collect your payment and act on your behalf. In this case a
medical practitioner must certify that you do not have the capacity to manage
your financial affairs. There is a section for this certification on the [
Authority to Appoint an Agent form (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/44370/a606cd22a6ca4d9d927222e349dc4a11.pdf) .

The agent nominated is often a family member, a care representative or a
representative of a nursing home or hospital.

The payment is made electronically to a nominated bank account. It is
recommended that a separate account be set up for this purpose.

In the case of a Ward of Court or an attorney appointed under an enduring
power of attorney (see below), the DSP will make payments directly to the
Committee of the Ward or to the attorney by nominating them as agent for the
social welfare recipient. All such payments will be made electronically to a
nominated bank account.

Appointed agents have a legal duty to ensure the money is used for your
benefit and they must also deal with other aspects of your social welfare
payment. This includes notifying the DSP of changes to your circumstances.
