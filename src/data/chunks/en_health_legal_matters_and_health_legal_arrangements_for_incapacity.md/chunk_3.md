##  Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015

The [ Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 ](/en/health/legal-matters-
and-health/assisted-decision-making-act/) creates new decision-making
arrangements to help people make decisions about their welfare and their
property and affairs. This assistance and support is required where the person
lacks, or may lack, the capacity to make the decision unaided.

The new arrangements include [ decision making assistance ](/en/health/legal-
matters-and-health/decision-making-assistance-agreement/) and [ co-decision-
making ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/co-decision-making-agreement/)
and a process is also set out for a court to appoint a [ decision-making
representative ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/decision-making-
assistance-agreement/) for an individual.

As well as introducing new decision-making procedures, the Act sets out new
arrangements for [ wards of court ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/wards-
of-court/) and for people who wish to make an [ enduring power of attorney
](/en/death/before-a-death/power-of-attorney/) .

The [ Decision Support Service ](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/) has been
set up to provide a range of functions when the new arrangements come into
effect.
