##  Your right to cancel

You have a right to cancel within 14 days when a product is not bought in a
physical shop. This is also known as a _‘withdrawal’_ or _‘cooling off’_
period.

This means you can cancel the contract up to 14 days from when the contract
was agreed and get a full refund.

You do not have to give you a reason for cancelling. The 14 days starts once
you physically receive the goods.

If the seller does not give you information on your cancellation rights, your
right to cancel is extended by 12 months. If the seller gives you information
on your right to cancel within this 12-month period, the cooling-off period
ends 14 days from the date you get the information.

You can read more about cooling off periods for services or digital content or
