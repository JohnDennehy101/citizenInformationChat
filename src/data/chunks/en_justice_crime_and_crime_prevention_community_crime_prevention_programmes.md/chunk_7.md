###  Community alert groups

The Community Alert programme operates through a network of community alert
groups, each of which is responsible for a particular area. A group may be set
up in response to community demand or as a result of Garda contact. There are
over 1,250 groups throughout the country.

Each group has an elected Community Alert Committee which manages the group
and a Community Alert Area Coordinator who keeps contact with a Garda Liaison
Officer. Resource materials are [ provided by the Garda Síochána
