##  Neighbourhood Watch

Neighbourhood Watch is a crime prevention programme aimed at getting local
communities in urban areas to observe and report suspicious activities to the
Gardaí.

The programme is a partnership between the Gardaí and representatives of the
community to prevent crime and create a safer social environment.
