##  How does the presidential election work?

The election must take place within the 60 days before the current President's
term of office expires. If the current President resigns, becomes
incapacitated, is removed or dies, then an election must be held within the
following 60 days.

Voting is by secret ballot and based on [ proportional representation
](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/proportional-
representation/) by the single transferable vote.

Most people will vote in person at their local polling station. [ Postal
voting ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-referenda/voting/registering-
to-vote/) is available to certain people who may be unable to vote in person.

If only one candidate is nominated for the office of President, an election is
not needed. This happened in November 2004, when Mary McAleese was inaugurated
as President for a second term without an election, as she was the only
candidate.
