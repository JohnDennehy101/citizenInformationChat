####  **Disposable capital calculation**

This applies only if your disposable capital is more than €4,000.

Disposable capital is the value of assets you own, such as a car or shares in
a company. Your family home and tools you use for work are not included when
calculating your disposable capital.

If your **disposable capital is between €4,000 and €54,000** , your maximum
contribution is 2.5% of the difference between €4,000 and your disposable
capital.

If your **disposable capital is more than €54,000** , your maximum
contribution is €1,250 plus 5% of the difference between €54,000 and your
disposable capital.
