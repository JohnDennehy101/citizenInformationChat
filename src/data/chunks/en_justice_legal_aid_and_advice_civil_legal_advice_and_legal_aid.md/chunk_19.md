##  Merit test for civil legal aid

If you need to go to court, the Legal Aid Board will look at the merits of
your case to make sure that it is legitimate.

The merit test checks:

  * Whether a reasonable person would take the case, if paying for it with their own money 
  * Whether a solicitor or barrister acting for you would recommend going to court, based on the facts of your case and knowing that you were paying for it yourself 
  * Whether you have grounds for taking the case, or defending the case being taken against you 
  * If this is the best way for you to resolve your dispute 
  * Whether you are likely to win your case 
  * The cost to the taxpayer against the benefit you might receive if you win 

If the case is about the welfare of a child – such as child custody or the
State trying to take your child into care – whether you are likely to win and
the taxpayer cost are not considered in the merit test.
