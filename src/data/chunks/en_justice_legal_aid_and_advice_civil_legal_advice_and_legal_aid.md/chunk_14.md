If you are facing significant financial hardship and cannot afford to pay a

Aid Board to have the contribution waived
](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/our-services/legal-aid-services/apply-for-a-
waiver-of-contribution/applying-for-a-waiver-of-contribution.html) . If you
want to apply for a waiver, you should speak to a member of staff in the Legal
Aid Board Law Centre (see ‘Further information’ below).

It is not guaranteed that the contribution will be waived and the Legal Aid
Board will only do this if they feel that paying the contribution would cause
you undue hardship.
