##  How to appeal if I am refused legal aid or advice?

If your application for legal aid or legal advice is refused, you can ask for
a review, or you can appeal the decision.

You must ask for a review or appeal within one month of the decision.

You do not need to ask for a review before making an appeal. If you ask for a
review and you are still unhappy with the decision, you can appeal that
decision.
