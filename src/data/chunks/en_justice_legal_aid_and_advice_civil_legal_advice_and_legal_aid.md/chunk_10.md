####  **Disposable income calculation**

If your disposable income is **less than €11,500** , you pay a maximum
contribution of €130.

If your disposable income is **more than €11,500 and less than €18,000** , you
pay a maximum contribution of €130 plus one-quarter of the difference between
€11,500 and your disposable income.
