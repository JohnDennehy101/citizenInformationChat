###  **If your application is accepted**

If your application is accepted, you will be asked to make a minimum
contribution (see ‘Do I have to pay for civil legal aid and advice?’ above).

If legal aid is necessary, you will be issued with a legal aid certificate.

There may be a [ waiting time for an appointment with a solicitor
](https://www.legalaidboard.ie/en/our-services/legal-aid-services/waiting-
times/) .

Some cases are given priority such as:

  * Domestic violence 
  * Childcare 
  * Child abduction 

Cases will also be prioritised if there is a danger that the time limits for
issuing proceedings will expire.

If both parties to a dispute are eligible for legal aid (for example, a
marriage or cohabitation breakdown), they will generally be represented by
different law centres.
