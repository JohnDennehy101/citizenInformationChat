###  Appealing a decision

If Tusla decides that you are not providing a certain minimum education for
your child, it can refuse to register or remove your child’s name from the
register. It must inform you of its decision in writing.

You have 21 days to appeal against the decision. The Minister will appoint a
committee to hear the appeal and decide on the case.

An appeal committee is made up of a District Court judge, an inspector and
another person. You and the assessor are invited to make submissions.
Depending on their decision, the committee will:

  * Uphold the decision of Tusla to remove or refuse to add your child’s name to the register 
  * Require Tusla to add your child’s name to the register 
  * Require Tusla to add your child’s name to the register if you agree to comply with any requirements the appeal committee considers appropriate.
