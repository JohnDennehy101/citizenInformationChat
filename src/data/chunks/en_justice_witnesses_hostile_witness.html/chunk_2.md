##  Introduction

A hostile witness is a [ witness ](/en/justice/witnesses/types-of-witnesses/)
who appears to be refusing to fully testify in support of the person who
called them or testifies in a way that significantly differs from their pre-
trial statement.

The person who calls you as a witness expects you to provide the court with
evidence similar to what you may have said in a pre-trial statement. If you
refuse to answer questions or contradict what you said before, the person who
called you can apply to the [ judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) to have
you declared a hostile witness.

A hostile witness can have their credibility called into question and can be
cross-examined and asked leading questions by the person who called them. The
person who called you may also use the process in an attempt to persuade you
to give evidence that agrees with your previous statement.
