##  Procedure followed when a witness is declared hostile

While the jury is not present the solicitor or barrister applies to the judge
to have the witness declared hostile. If they are making the application on
the basis of a pre-trial statement then they show that to the judge.

If the judge rules that the witness can be treated as a hostile witness
because of a prior inconsistent statement, then the jury is brought back in
and it is put to the witness that any pre-trial statement is significantly
different from, or contradicts the evidence they have given in the witness
box.

If the witness denies this, then the Garda who took the statement normally
goes into the witness box and proves to the judge that the statement was made
(without revealing the contents of the statement).

After this, if the witness continues to deny the contradiction, then the pre-
trial statement is read into evidence. It is read to the jury as proof that
the witness made a contradictory or different statement to the evidence they
offered while in the witness-box. The judge must make it clear to the jury
that what the witness has said in the prior statement is not evidence of the
facts in the statement, but only evidence relating to the credibility of the
witness, unless [ section 16 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2006/act/26/section/16/enacted/en/html)
is also being invoked. Section 16 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 gives a
judge the power to admit a pre-trial statement as evidence of the facts
contained in that statement, even though the witness later refuses to give
evidence, denies making the statement, or contradicts it.

The [ statement can only be admitted ](/en/justice/witnesses/admissibility-of-
witness-statements-in-a-criminal-trial/) if the court is satisfied that:

  * The witness made it 
  * It was made voluntarily 
  * It is reliable 
  * The facts would be admissible if the witness gave testimony about them in court 
  * The witness signed an affirmation that the statement was the truth (e.g. a statutory declaration), or the court is satisfied that the witness understood that they must tell the truth
