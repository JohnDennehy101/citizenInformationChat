##  What happens if I am declared a hostile witness?

Normally, if a solicitor or barrister calls you as a witness, they cannot
attack your credibility or cross-examine you as if you were a witness for the
other side. They also cannot generally ask questions about, or introduce
evidence of any prior inconsistent statements. The calling barrister cannot
ask leading questions either in an attempt to get you to say what they want.

If the judge decides you are a hostile witness, the barrister calling you can:

  * Cross-examine you on the statement you made before the trial 
  * Ask leading questions in an effort to get you to say what they want 

If you are cross-examined on your previous statement, that statement is
generally only used as evidence of your inconsistency, it is not automatically
evidence of the facts contained in the statement. However, it may be possible
for the person who called you to have that statement allowed as evidence of
the facts contained in it.

For more detailed information you should seek legal advice.
