###  Part-time employees

Generally, annual leave for part-time workers is calculated using **Method 3**
above. This means you can get 8% of your hours worked.

If you work full time for some months and part-time for the rest of the year,
you should calculate the leave for the full-time and the part-time periods of
work separately.
