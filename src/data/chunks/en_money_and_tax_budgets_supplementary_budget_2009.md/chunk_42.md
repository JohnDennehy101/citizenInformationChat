**Mortgage Interest Relief**

Mortgage interest relief for private residences will only be available for the
first 7 years of the mortgage. Anyone who has been receiving interest relief
for the past 7 years will no longer be eligible after 1 May 2009. However
interest relief will be allowed on a pro-rata basis for the first 4 months of
2009. This means a maximum relief amount for 2009 of €1,000 for single people
/€2,000 for married couples for people who have over 7 years on their mortgage
(1 May 2009).

**Stamp duty “trade-in” scheme**

A new stamp duty “trade-in” scheme has been announced. Under the scheme no
stamp duty is payable by a person who accepts a traded-in property in exchange
or part exchange for a new house or apartment. Stamp duty will apply when the
person subsequently sells on the ‘swapped’ or traded-in house. Full details
will be outlined in the Finance Bill.

**Rent Supplement**

Rent Supplement will be reduced to reflect the fall in rents. There will also
be other changes to the Rent Supplement eligibility and payment regime.
