##  What is the new mortgage interest tax credit scheme?

A new temporary mortgage interest tax credit was announced in Budget 2024 for
certain homeowners. This tax credit only applies to tax assessments for 2023.

The tax relief is available to taxpayers with mortgage balances of between
€80,000 and €500,000 as of 31 December 2022. The credit is available for the
2023 tax year only and is based on the increase in interest paid in 2023
compared with the interest paid in 2022.
