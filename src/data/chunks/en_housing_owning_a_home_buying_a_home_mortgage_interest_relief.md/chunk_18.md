###  **How much is the Homeowner’s Once-Off Payment?**

If you qualify for payment, you’ll get the same amount as if you’d qualified
for the mortgage interest tax credit. This is because the payment and the
credit are calculated in the same way. So, you get 20% of the amount that your
mortgage interest increased between 2022 and 2023. And the payment is capped
at €1,250.
