##  What if I don’t qualify for the mortgage interest tax credit?

If you applied for the mortgage interest tax credit, but didn’t get it because
you hadn’t paid enough income tax, you may qualify for the [ Homeowner’s Once-
Off Payment ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5157e-homeowners-once-off-
payment/) instead. The Homeowner’s Once-Off Payment is paid by the Department
of Social Protection to certain people who didn’t qualify for the mortgage
interest tax credit.
