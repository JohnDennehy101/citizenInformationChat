####  **Senior Cycle book rental scheme**

Post-primary schools in the Free Education Scheme can help Senior Cycle
students (those in Transition Year, fifth year, and sixth year) with the cost
of schoolbooks.

The scheme allows schools to support students from low-income families or
families experiencing financial hardship. Under the scheme, schools can
either:

  * Set up a book rental scheme within the school, or 
  * Help individual students buy books 

You must pay a small rental fee.

You can contact your childâ€™s school to see if they have a book rental scheme.
If not, you can suggest it to the school principal. You can also read the [
Guide for Parents: Textbook rental schemes (pdf) ](https://s3-eu-

To apply for assistance under the scheme, contact the school principal. The
principal has full discretion in deciding which students are most in need.
