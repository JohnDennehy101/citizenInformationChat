####  **Remote Area Grant**

If a student qualifies for the school transport scheme but there is no
transport service available, a Remote Area Grant may be paid to contribute
towards private transport arrangements.

These grants may also be paid to students who live 3.2 km or more from the
nearest pick-up point for school transport.
