####  **Free books for Junior Cycle students**

From September 2024, schools in the Free Education Scheme will provide free
schoolbooks and core classroom resources to all Junior Cycle students (those
in the first 3 years of post-primary school).

Core classroom resources include things like copybooks, journals, calculators
and dictionaries.

The school will provide the free books on loan. You must return the books at
the end of the school year, or if your child leaves the school. If you must
buy additional items for your child, the school will let you know. While the
scheme includes eBooks, it does not cover the purchase of digital devices.

If your child already started in first year of post-primary school, you may
already have their Junior Cycle books. If your child needs additional books
before starting second or third year in September 2024, the school will
provide them for free.
