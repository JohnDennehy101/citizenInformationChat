###  **Remote Area Boarding Grant**

The Remote Area Boarding Grant provides funding for students to get boarding
or lodging so they can attend a free second-level school.

To qualify for a boarding grant, you must:

  * Live at least 4.8km from a free second-level school 
  * Live more than 3.2 km from a pick-up point on a transport service to a free second-level school 
  * Be unable to get a place in a suitable second-level school within 25km of where you live 
  * Be proposing to attend a second-level school that provides free education 

Students living on offshore islands which do not have a school providing
suitable free second-level education may also qualify.

The maximum grant available is €4,947 per year. This is paid to the school, or
to the parent or guardian, after each school term once the school has verified
the student’s attendance during the year. You may need to provide a statement
of the boarding or lodging fees paid.

Applications for children starting in September of each year should be
submitted before 30 April of that year. Applications received after this time
may not be processed by September. You cannot apply online.
