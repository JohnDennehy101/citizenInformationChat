###  **Free primary schoolbooks**

Since September 2023, parents of children in primary school and special
schools do not have to pay for [ schoolbooks, workbooks and copybooks (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/250812/c0e12161-a64b-4dce-88d8-c7e6a6ed4a68.pdf#page=null)
.

The school provides the free books on loan. You must return the books at the
end of the school year, or if your child leaves the school. You should make
sure the books are kept in good condition so they can be re-used.

If you must buy additional items for your child, the school will let you know.
