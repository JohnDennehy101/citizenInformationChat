##  What is a payslip?

Your _payslip_ is a written statement from your employer, showing your _gross
pay_ (that means your total earnings before tax), PRSI and other deductions.

Your employer must give you a payslip every time they pay you, either when you
get paid or shortly after.

Your employer can choose whether they give printed or electronic (online)
payslips.

Your payslip can be used as proof of your earnings, tax paid and any pension
contributions.

Your right to a payslip is in [ Section 4
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1991/en/act/pub/0025/sec0004.html) of the
Payment of Wages Act 1991.
