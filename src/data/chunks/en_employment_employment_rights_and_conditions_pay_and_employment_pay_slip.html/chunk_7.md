##  How to make a complaint

If you have a complaint about your payslip that you cannot sort out with your
employer, you can make a complaint to the [ Workplace Relations Commission
(WRC) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/workplace-relations-commission/) using their [ online complaint form.
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)

You must make your complaint **within 6 months** of the date of the deduction.
The time limit can be extended for a further 6 months, but only if there is a
reasonable cause for the delay.
