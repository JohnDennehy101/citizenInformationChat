###  Partnership

A partnership is where you set up your business with 1 or more people (known
as ‘partners’). Each partner is jointly responsible for running the business,
and each partner must pay income tax, PRSI and USC on their share of the
profits.

If the business fails, all partners are jointly responsible for the debt.

Your partnership agreement should be drawn up by a solicitor.
