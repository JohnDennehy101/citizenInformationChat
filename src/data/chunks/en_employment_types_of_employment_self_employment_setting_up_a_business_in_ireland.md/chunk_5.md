###  Sole trader

If you choose to be a sole trader, you are ‘self-employed’ and you do not have
a business partner. You are personally responsible for the business.

Your main legal duty is to register as a self-employed person with Revenue
(see the section on ‘Tax and PRSI’ below). If you want to use a business name,
you must [ register your business name with the Companies Registration Office
(CRO) ](https://www.cro.ie/Registration/Business-Name) .

While it is relatively simple to set up as a sole trader, your personal assets
could be used to pay your creditors if your business fails.
