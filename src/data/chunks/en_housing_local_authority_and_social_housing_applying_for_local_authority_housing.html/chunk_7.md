####  **What is the income criteria for social housing?**

The [ Household Means Policy ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/fb1f2-social-
housing-support-household-means-policy/) provides details of how your
household income is assessed by local authorities for social housing support.
It includes information about what income is taken into account and what
income is disregarded (not taken into account). For example, certain social
welfare payments are not considered in these assessments.

There are 3 maximum income limits that apply to different housing authorities.

**Basic maximum income limits per area** **Areas** |  **Maximum net income limits for a single person**  
---|---  
Cork City, Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, Galway City, Co Meath, South Dublin, Co Kildare, Co Wicklow  |  €40,000   
Co Carlow, Co Clare, Co Cork, Co Galway, Co Kerry, Co Kilkenny, Co Laois, Limerick City and County, Co Louth, Waterford City and County, Co Westmeath, Co Wexford  |  €35,000   
Co Cavan, Co Donegal, Co Leitrim, Co Longford, Co Mayo, Co Monaghan, Co Offaly, Co Roscommon, Co Sligo, Co Tipperary  |  €30,000   
  
These are the maximum net income limits for a single person. These limits are
increased if there are other members of your household. You get an additional:

  * 5% of the basic maximum income limit for every adult member of the household. This is up to a maximum of 10% or 2 additional adults. 
  * 2.5% of the basic maximum income limit for every child in the household 

The local authority looks at your household’s average net income for the 12
months before they received your application when assessing if your household
meets the income criteria. Net income is the amount you are left with once

and PRSI are deducted from your income.

The Department provide guidance notes to local authorities with further
details about assessing income for social housing support. For example, these
guidance notes state that savings are only relevant to the income assessment
if they generate an income for applicants, by way of dividend or interest.

If you are looking for information about any income you have that is not
included in the Household Means Policy you should contact your local
authority.
