##  What is social housing?

Social housing is housing provided by local authorities and [ approved housing
bodies (AHBs) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-
and-social-housing/approved-housing-bodies/) for people who cannot afford to
buy a home or rent accommodation privately. Social housing is allocated
according to your eligibility and need. The rent you pay is based on your
householdâ€™s ability to pay.
