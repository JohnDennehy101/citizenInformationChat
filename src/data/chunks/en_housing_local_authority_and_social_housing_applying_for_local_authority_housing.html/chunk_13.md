###  Applying for AHB or accessible social housing

If you want to be considered for accommodation provided by a [ housing
association ](http://icsh.ie/content/search-for-members) or other approved
housing body, tick the box marked 'approved housing body' on the application
form. Some housing associations may accept direct applications.

If you are a wheelchair user or need accessible accommodation you should tick
the box marked ‘wheelchair liveable accommodation’ in the section of the form
that asks about your housing requirements. There is a supporting Disability or
Medical Information Form (HMD Form) for people applying for social housing
with a medical or disability need.
