##  What are the main rules when applying for social housing?

There are rules about how local authorities manage social housing
applications. They include a number of important elements, such as:

  * You can only apply to one housing authority 
  * You must already be living in the area covered by that housing authority, or have a [ local connection ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/si/84/made/en/print) with the area (though a housing authority may agree to waive this requirement) 
  * You will only be considered for social housing if your household income is less than the threshold that applies in the housing authorityâ€™s area 

These rules are set-out in the [ Social Housing Assessment Regulations
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/ResultsSITitle.html?q=Social+Housing+Assessment+Regulations+&=&=)
