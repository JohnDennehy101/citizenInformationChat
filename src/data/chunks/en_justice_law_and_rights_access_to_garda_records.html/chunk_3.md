##  Can I access any data being held on me by the Gardaí?

You can access any data being held but there are a number of restrictions on
the data you can access. In certain circumstances the Gardaí can refuse
access.

You can make a request to the Garda Síochána for a copy of any personal data
that it has about you. You are entitled to:

  * Get a copy of the personal data being kept about you 
  * Know why the data is being kept 
  * Know the identity of anyone that the Gardaí share the data with 
  * Know how the Gardaí obtained the data (unless it would be against public interest) 

You also have other rights under data protection law, including the right to
have any inaccurate personal information about you corrected or erased and the
right to complain to [ the Data Protection Commission
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/exercising-your-rights/raising-
concern-commission) .

Once the Gardaí receive a valid request from you, they must reply to you
within 1 month. This is the case even if they do not hold any of your personal
data or they are refusing the request.

If the Gardaí decide to provide the information to you, they must:

  * Supply the information to you within 1 month of receiving your request. (If your request is complicated or involves a large amount of data, the Gardaí can extend this period to 3 months. They must tell you they are doing this within 1 month of getting your request). 
  * Provide the information in a way that is clear. 

If you request a copy of your criminal record, personal data relating to [
spent convictions ](/en/justice/criminal-law/spent-convictions/) (if any) is
provided separately to other personal data relating to criminal records or
court outcomes.

You can authorise someone else to request your data, you will have to confirm
in writing that you are authorising this person to make the request. The
Gardaí will need to be satisfied as to the identity of your representative.
