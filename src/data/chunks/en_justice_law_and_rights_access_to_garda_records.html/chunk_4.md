###  Can the Gardaí refuse my request?

In certain circumstances, the Gardaí can refuse your request for personal data
and withhold that information. These include where:

  * Your request for data would identify someone else. This also applies to the Gardaí's obligation to provide details of the source of the information. If the source or origin of the information identifies a third party, then it can be withheld. 
  * It would interfere in the prevention, detection or investigation of a crime, or interfere with arresting or prosecuting offenders.
