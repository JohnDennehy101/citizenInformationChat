##  Equality and discrimination

There are 2 distinct pieces of legislation in place which set out equality
rights for people and specifically outlaw discrimination when it occurs. The [
Employment Equality Acts 1998–2015
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/1998/act/21/revised/en/html) and the [
Equal Status Acts 2000–2015
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2000/act/8/revised/en/html) outlaw
discrimination in employment, vocational training, advertising, collective
agreements, the provision of goods and services. Specifically, goods and
services include professional or trade services; health services; access to
accommodation and education; facilities for banking, transport and cultural
activities.

Under equality legislation discrimination based on any one of the following
distinct grounds is unlawful. These grounds are:

  * Gender 
  * Civil status 
  * Family status 
  * Sexual orientation 
  * Religion 
  * Age (does not apply to a person under 18) 
  * Disability 
  * Race 
  * Membership of the Traveller community 

Since 1 January 2016, under the Equal Status Acts 2000–2015, you cannot be
discriminated against when renting because you are getting Rent Supplement or
any other social welfare payment, or a Housing Assistance Payment. This is
known as the housing assistance ground.
