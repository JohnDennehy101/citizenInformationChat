If you have a visual impairment, you may use a white cane or stick. There are
different types of canes and sticks and they have different uses. Some are
designed to help with mobility while others are used to let people know you
have a visual impairment.

  * A **white walking stick** gives you some physical support and lets other people know that you have a visual impairment. It is not a mobility aid. 
  * A **symbol cane** is used to let others know that you have a visual impairment and that you might need assistance. It is not a mobility aid and does not provide physical support. 
  * A **long cane** is a mobility aid designed to help you get around. You sweep the cane from side to side on the ground in front of your body. This helps you locate potential hazards and changes in the texture and level of the ground. You will need training on how to use a long cane. 
  * A **guide cane** is a mobility aid. It is shorter than a long cane and has more limited use. The guide cane can be used in 2 ways, you can hold it in a diagonal position across your lower body for protection, or you can use it to scan for kerbs and steps. It does not give you physical support. You will need training on how to use a guide cane.
