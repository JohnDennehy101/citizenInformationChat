##  Introduction

If you have a visual impairment, you can get help to develop skills to make it
easier to move around safely. You can get training and advice on how to use a
white cane or learn how to work with a guide dog.

[ Vision Ireland ](https://www.ncbi.ie/) (formally National Council for the
Blind) and [ Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind ](https://guidedogs.ie/) offer
training. This page outlines some of these supports and how you can access
them.
