###  Pay instead of notice

You may be required to work the notice period or you may accept pay in lieu
(instead) of notice, if offered.

Pay in lieu of notice means that you will not have to work for the period
between receiving notice and the end of your employment. You still get the
same amount of wages that you would have received, had you worked. This
payment is not regarded as wages or salary but as [ compensation for loss of
employment ](/en/employment/retirement/income-tax-in-retirement/retirement-
lump-sum-taxation/) , which may qualify for tax relief.

However, if your contract of employment allows for a payment on termination of
the contract or if you work for the period of notice, you pay tax and PRSI in
the normal way.

If you get pay in lieu of notice you are considered to be unemployed and
available for work during this period. This means that you can claim a [
jobseeker’s payment ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/signing-on/) . You
cannot claim a jobseeker’s payment for any day that you are receiving holiday
pay (see below).

During your period of notice you should receive your normal pay. This also
applies if you are paid in lieu of notice.
