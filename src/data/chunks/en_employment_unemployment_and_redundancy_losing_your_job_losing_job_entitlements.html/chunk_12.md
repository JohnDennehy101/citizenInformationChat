###  **Public holiday**

If your employment ends during the week ending on the day before a public
holiday and you have worked for your employer for the previous 4 weeks, you
should get an additional day's pay for the public holiday. This also applies
to part-time employees who have a right to the public holiday by working at
least 40 hours in the previous 5 weeks.
