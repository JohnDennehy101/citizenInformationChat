####  **Non-dependent adult household members**

For each non-dependent adult member of the household, 20% of their gross
income is added to the household income.

For example, a household with:

  * A couple with a gross income of €85,000, and 
  * A non-dependent adult with an income of €20,000 

Will receive 100% of the amount allowable as the household income is less than
€90,000 (€85,000 + €4,000 [€20,000 x 20%] = €89,000).

**If you have no insurance**

If you had no insurance and you do not have reasonable grounds for not having
insurance:

  * You will be expected to contribute the first €2,000 toward the amount allowable, and 
  * Your personal contribution will be 2% for each whole €1,000 above the appropriate income level for your household
