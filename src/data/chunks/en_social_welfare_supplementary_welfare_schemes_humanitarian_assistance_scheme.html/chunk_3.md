##  What does the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme cover?

The scheme covers:

  * Emergency income support payments 
  * Damage to your home and its essential contents, such as carpets, flooring, furniture, household appliances and bedding 
  * Structural damage 

The scheme is usually only available to help people who have been impacted by
a severe weather event, but the Department of Social Protection can extend it
to cover other exceptional circumstances at their discretion.
