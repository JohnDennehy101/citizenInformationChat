##  How much can I get under the scheme?

How much is paid under the scheme depends on how severe the damage is and your
ability to meet these costs.

Where the cost of structural repairs is estimated to be more than â‚¬5,000, the
Department of Social Protection will appoint and get advice from a loss
adjudicator.

In assessing cases for humanitarian assistance, account will be taken of [
Additional Needs Payments ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/additional-needs-payment/) already paid out.
