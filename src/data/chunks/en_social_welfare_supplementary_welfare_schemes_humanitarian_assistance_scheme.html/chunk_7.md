####  **If you are single**

If you have a gross household income of €50,000 or less, you will get 100% of
the amount allowable.

For each whole €1,000 of household income above €50,000, you will be required
to make a 1% contribution to the amount allowable.

For example, if you are:

  * Single, and 
  * Have a gross household income of €55,000 

You will get 95% of the amount allowable (€5,000 over the income limit of
€50,000 = 5% personal contribution towards the loss).
