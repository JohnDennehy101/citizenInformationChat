##  What is the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme?

The Humanitarian Assistance Scheme is an income-tested scheme that provides
emergency financial assistance to households affected by a severe weather
event such as flooding.

It is administered by the Community Welfare Service.

The scheme provides financial support to people who have suffered damage to
their home. It is designed to help you meet the cost of essential needs and
repairs rather than provide full compensation for losses or damage.
