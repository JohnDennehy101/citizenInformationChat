###  Know about your equality rights when renting residential property

Landlords cannot discriminate against potential tenants on grounds of:

  * Gender 
  * Civil status 
  * Family status 
  * Sexual orientation 
  * Religion 
  * Age 
  * Disability 
  * Race 
  * Membership of the Traveller community 

You also cannot be discriminated against when renting because you are getting
a:

  * Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) 
  * Rent Supplement 
  * Any other social welfare payment 

This means that landlords cannot state when advertising accommodation that HAP
or Rent Supplement is not accepted, and they cannot refuse to rent you
accommodation because you are getting a social welfare payment. This is
outlined in the [ Equal Status Acts 2000â€“2015
](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_2000_0008.HTM)
.

If you feel you have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent,
you can find out more about [ making a complaint under the Equal Status Acts
