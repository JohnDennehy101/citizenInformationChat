##  How to find private rented accommodation

Most rooms, flats, apartments and houses to rent are advertised on
accommodation websites. You can search for a particular type of accommodation
and set up alerts for your specific requirements.

You may also find rented accommodation to let:

  * In the accommodation sections of newspapers 
  * In advertisements in shops 
  * On college notice boards 
  * At your student union, many of whom keep accommodation lists 
  * By word of mouth 
  * By seeing 'To Let' signs on properties 
  * Through social media pages dedicated to finding and renting accommodation 
  * By using an accommodation or letting agency 

**What are letting agencies?**

Accommodation agencies or letting agencies are commercial organisations that
help you find private rented accommodation. They may charge you a fee. Before
registering with an agency, you should find out:

  * Is the agency licensed? 
  * What services does it offer? 
  * If you pay a fee, in what circumstances will you get a refund? 
  * If you decide to register with the agency, make sure you get a receipt for any money you pay.
