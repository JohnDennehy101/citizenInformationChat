###  **How do I avoid getting scammed?**

There are a number of things you can do to try and avoid being scammed. You
should:

  * **Inspect the property in person.** Do not rely on online videos or photos when viewing a property. Take a picture of the landlord or letting agent’s ID where possible. 
  * **Use a secure payment method.** Avoid making cash payments or transferring money directly to someone without verifying their identity and visiting the property. Get a receipt for any payments you make and avoid using unsecure payment methods like wire transfers or cryptocurrency. 
  * **Ask for a contract.** Request a written contract, such as a tenancy or licence agreement. This will explain the terms and conditions of your tenancy. 
  * **Do your research.** Be familiar with current rental prices in the area you want to rent. If something appears too good to be true, investigate further before making a payment **.**
  * **Take your time.** Don’t rush into making a decision. Scammers will often try to rush you, but it is important to take your time and do your research before making a decision. 
  * **Look for advice.** If you are unsure about something and suspect it may be a scam, you can contact [ Threshold ](https://threshold.ie/) for advice.
