##  I want to learn skills for work

Another option when you leave school is a [ further education and training
(FET) course ](/en/education/further-education-and-training/training-courses/)
. FET courses can give school leavers the skills for work.

You can apply for an [ apprenticeship
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/vocational-education-and-
training/apprenticeships/) to be trained in a traditional craft apprenticeship
such as plumbing or carpentry or a new apprenticeship such as accounts
technician.

[ Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) courses ](/en/education/further-education-
and-training/post-leaving-certificate-courses/) can develop your technical and
practical skills for an industry-recognised qualification.

[ Youthreach ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/vocational-
education-and-training/youthreach/) also runs paid training courses for early
school-leavers.

The [ Right Course ](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/f205a-the-right-
course/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/therightcourse/) is an online portal with
information on further education and training places, higher education courses
and information if you are on a social welfare payment and want to begin a
course.

If you are planning to learn or work in Europe, you can use [ Europass
](/en/education/european-education-programmes/europass/) to search for
qualifications, courses and learning opportunities in other EU countries.
