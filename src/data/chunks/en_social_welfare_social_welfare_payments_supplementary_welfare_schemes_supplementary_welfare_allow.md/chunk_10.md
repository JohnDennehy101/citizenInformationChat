###  **Living with your parent**

If you are **24 years of age or under** and you are living with a parent or a
step-parent in the family home, some of your parents' income will also be
taken into account in the assessment for Supplementary Welfare Allowance.

The Department of Social Protection calls this an assessment of the 'benefit
and privilege' you get from living with your parents.
