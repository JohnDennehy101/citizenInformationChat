##  Can I appeal my Leaving Certificate results?

You can appeal your [ Leaving Certificate ](/en/education/state-
examinations/leaving-certificate/) results.

If you are not satisfied with the marks you get in one or more subjects of the
Leaving Certificate examination, you can appeal those results to the [ State
Examinations Commission (SEC)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/state-examinations/the-
state-examinations-commission/) .

If you appeal your mark in a written exam, your script will be sent to an
appeal examiner for re-marking.
