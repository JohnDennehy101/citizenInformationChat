##  How the Leaving Certificate appeal process works

Your script will be sent to an appeal examiner for re-marking. This will not
be the same person who originally marked your work. The same marking scheme is
used for re-marking. This means that appeal examiners apply the same standards
in re-marking as were applied to all candidates in the original examination.

For Leaving Certificate 2024, a post-marking adjustment was made to all
results. These are additional marks awarded to a candidate's component
results. Post-marking adjustments cannot be appealed. However, the post-
adjustment changes if your overall mark changes following the appeal.
