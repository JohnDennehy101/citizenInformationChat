###  Adjudication

If the two parties do not agree to the mediation process, or if the RTB
decides that mediation is not the best option, the case goes to adjudication.
This means that an adjudicator makes a decision, which may or may not reflect
any agreement reached between the parties. The parties then decide if they are
willing to accept this decision.

Adjudication hearings are held online, but you can request a face-to-face
hearing. The [ RTB’s Guide to Virtual Dispute Resolution Hearings (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/general/Guide_to_Virtual_Dispute_Resolution_Hearings_%284%29.pdf)
has useful information about the online process.

An adjudicator is appointed to investigate the case fully. You can send
documentary evidence to support your claim to the RTB. This should be sent at
least 5 days before your hearing. The [ RTB’s Guide to Evidence (pdf)
](https://www.rtb.ie/images/uploads/forms/RTB%E2%80%99s_Guide_to_Evidence_Stage_%28Revised_Oct_2022%29_2.pdf)
has useful information about types of evidence and how to submit them.

At the hearing both parties will have a chance to present their side of the
dispute using the documentary evidence they sent. Based on the evidence of the
two parties, the adjudicator decides how the dispute is to be resolved. The
adjudicator's report is sent to both parties in the case, along with letters
of acceptance and rejection, one of which must be filled out and returned to
the RTB within 10 days. If both parties accept the adjudication decision, it
becomes a legally binding determination order of the RTB. Read more about the
