##  What is the Ready to Build Scheme?

Under the Ready to Build Scheme, you can buy a site from a local authority to
build your own home on. The sites are sold in towns and villages at reduced
prices of up to €30,000 below the market value. These sites have all the
necessary infrastructure.

Local authorities can sell sites they already own for this scheme or they can
buy new sites. They make these sites available for people to build homes on by
providing access and services to the sites, such as electricity, water and
wastewater.

The discount you get when you buy the site depends on how much it costs the
local authority to provide services on the site before selling it to you. The
maximum discount is €30,000.

You must live in the home as your principal private residence when the home is
built.

The scheme is funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and
Heritage through the Croí Cónaithe (Towns) Fund and you apply to your local
authority. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has [
