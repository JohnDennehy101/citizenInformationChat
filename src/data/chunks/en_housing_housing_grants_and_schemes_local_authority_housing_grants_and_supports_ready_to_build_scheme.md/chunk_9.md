##  What happens if I want to sell my home or rent it out?

If you decide to sell your home or rent it out within 10 years of buying the
site, you will have to pay the local authority back. The amount you repay
depends on how long you’ve lived there. If you live there for:

  * Less than 5 years, you have to repay the full discount you got on the site 
  * Over 5 years but less than 10, you have to repay 75% of the discount on the site 
  * More than 10 years, you don’t have to pay back anything 

You must pay back some or all of the discount in any situation where the home
is no longer your primary residence within the first 10 years.
