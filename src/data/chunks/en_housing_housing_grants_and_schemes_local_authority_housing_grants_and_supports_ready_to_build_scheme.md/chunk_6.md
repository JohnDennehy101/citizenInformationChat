##  How do I apply for the Ready to Build Scheme?

The Ready to Build Scheme is new so there may not be sites available to buy
under the scheme yet.

When sites become available to buy under the scheme, they will be advertised
on your local authorityâ€™s website and in relevant local publications. The
advertisements will contain information about the sites and the closing date
for applications.

You complete the [ application form
](https://assets.gov.ie/234996/d715bb9e-c2a3-42fd-8e74-06cfa053a9ee.pdf) (pdf)
and send it to the [ local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) with your
supporting documents. The local authority will review your application and
documents and write to you to let you know if your application has been
successful.

You can contact the [ Vacant Homes Officer in your local authority
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/f59b3-vacant-homes-officer-contacts/) if
you have questions about the scheme.
