###  Providing information

You must complete a Prescribed Financial Statement (PFS), giving full and
honest information about your financial circumstances. You must act in good
faith and co-operate fully with the process.

You must allow access to certain personal data held by banks and other
financial institutions so that your financial situation can be verified.
Government departments and agencies will have the power to release certain
information about you.

The AI will help you to complete the Prescribed Financial Statement and will
then process your application if:

  * You meet the eligibility conditions 
  * The information in your PFS is complete and accurate in all material respects - you must confirm this by making a statutory declaration 

A statutory declaration is a solemn statement which must be signed in the
presence of someone who is authorised to witness statutory declarations â€“ such
as a practising solicitor, a Peace Commissioner, a notary public or a
Commissioner for Oaths.
