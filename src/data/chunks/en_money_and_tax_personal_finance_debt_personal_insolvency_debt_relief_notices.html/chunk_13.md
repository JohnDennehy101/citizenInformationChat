##  How do I get a Debt Relief Notice?

You must apply through an Approved Intermediary (AI) â€“ see [ How to apply
](debt_relief_notices.en.html#ld1a9a) below.

You must disclose all details of your financial affairs to the AI, who will
then advise you whether or not you meet the conditions for a DRN, the
consequences, and any alternative options.

If you decide go ahead and apply for a DRN, you must confirm your intention in
writing.
