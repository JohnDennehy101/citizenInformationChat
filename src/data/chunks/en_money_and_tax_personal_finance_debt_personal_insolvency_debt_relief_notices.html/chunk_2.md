##  What is a Debt Relief Notice?

A Debt Relief Notice (DRN) is one of [ 3 debt resolution arrangements
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/personal-
insolvency-options/) for people who cannot afford to pay their personal debts.
These arrangements offer different solutions to people in different
situations.

The Debt Relief Notice is for people who have very low disposable income or
assets. It allows for the write-off of qualifying debt up to â‚¬35,000 under a
3-year supervision period.

This page describes how to qualify for a DRN and how the process works.
