###  Extension or unsuccessful ending of a DRN

In certain circumstances, the Debt Relief Notice may be amended or terminated,
enforcement orders may be issued, or the supervision period may be extended.
The main situations in which this can happen are:

  * If you have failed to disclose an improvement in your financial position during the supervision period, the Circuit Court can make an order for enforcement, extend the period of the DRN, amend the DRN or make other orders or directions. 
  * If you or one of your creditors are aggrieved by something the Insolvency Service has done (or not done) and apply to the Circuit Court, the court may decide to revoke a decision of the ISI or make an order as above. 
  * If it turns out that you have given incomplete or false information, were not originally eligible for a DRN, have failed to surrender money to the ISI or are otherwise in breach of your DRN obligations, the court can make orders as above or can decide to terminate the DRN. 
  * In the 6 months before applying for the DRN, you had arranged your financial affairs so that you could get a DRN 

If your Debt Relief Notice is terminated by the Court, you will be liable to
pay all the unpaid debts that it had covered (unless the Court orders
otherwise) along with any arrears, charges and interest that built up during
the supervision period.
