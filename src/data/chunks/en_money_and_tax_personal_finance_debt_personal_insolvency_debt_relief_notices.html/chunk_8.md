###  Effects on your creditors

The issue of the DRN will usually be the first official notification to your
creditors that you have applied to have your debts written off. However,
creditors with excludable debts, will be consulted beforehand about having
their debts included as permitted debts. Your other creditors can object on
certain specified grounds when they receive the DRN – see ‘Objections’ below.

During the supervision period, your creditors will not be allowed to take any
action against you for the recovery of debts covered by the DRN. This means
that your creditors cannot:

  * Start of continue legal action or 
  * Seek to recover payment for a debt or recover goods or 
  * Execute or [ enforce a judgment ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/enforcement-of-debt-judgments/) in respect of a debt 
  * Contact you for payment 

However, if any of your debts were guaranteed by another person, the creditor
can take action against that person.

**Objections**

Any of your creditors may apply to the Circuit Court if they object to the
inclusion of the debts you owe them in the Debt Relief Notice.

They can only object on the following grounds:

  * You are not eligible for a DRN 
  * You provided inaccurate information 
  * You have failed to inform the Insolvency Service of changed circumstances or failed to surrender extra income as required 
  * You are an undischarged bankrupt 
  * You have committed an offence under the Personal Insolvency legislation since the DRN came into effect 
  * The procedural requirements were not followed 
  * In the 6 months before applying for the DRN, you had arranged your financial affairs so that you could get a DRN 

The Court has the power to make various decisions, including extending or
ending the DRN. The ISI may apply to the Court for withdrawal of the notice on
similar grounds and with similar consequences – see ‘Extension or unsuccessful
ending of a DRN’ below.
