###  Excluded and excludable debts

The [ Personal Insolvency Act 2012
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2012/act/44/revised/en/html) specifies
certain types of debt that **cannot** be written off by a Debt Relief Notice.
These are called _excluded_ debts.

The Act specifies certain other types of debt that are _excludable_ from a
DRN. This means that they can only be covered by the DRN if the creditor is
asked and agrees to let them be included. If they agree, they become
_permitted_ debts – debts that the creditor permits to be covered. Most types
of excludable debts are those owed to the State.

The types of debts that are _excluded_ are those that are due to:

  * Family law orders, such as [ maintenance orders ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) for spouses and children 
  * Court awards for personal injury or death 
  * A loan (or forbearance of a loan) obtained through fraud or similar wrongdoing 
  * Court orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Acts 
  * Fines imposed by the courts for criminal offences 

The types of debt that are _excludable_ are:

  * Taxes, duties or levies owed to the State, such as income tax, the [ Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) , [ VAT ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/duties-and-vat/value-added-tax/) or capital taxes 
  * Service charges owed to local authorities 
  * Rates 
  * Money owed for a [ Nursing Home Loan under the Fair Deal Scheme ](../../../../health/health_services/health_services_for_older_people/nursing_homes_support_scheme_1.en.html#ld1971)
  * Money owed to the Department of Social Protection 
  * Debts due to [ owners’ management companies ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/management-companies-for-apartment-blocks/) in respect of annual service charges or contributions due for multi-unit developments (this is the only non-State debt in this category)
