##  Can a development plan influence my application for planning permission?

All planning applications in your area are measured against the local
development plan for your area. Planning permission will normally only be
given if your application aligns with the development plan.

For example, the plan will contain different residential or industrial areas.
So, developments that fit with how these areas have been designated may get
planning permission.

If you want to apply for planning permission, especially to build a house, you
should look at the development plan in your area first.
