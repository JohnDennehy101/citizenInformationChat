###  **When can I give feedback about a development plan?**

When a new development plan is being prepared, your local authority will
inform the public that they intend to review the plan. They will do this
using:

  * Local or national media 
  * Social media 
  * Other web-based channels 

You can make observations, submissions and suggestions for the development
plan at this time.

The local authority then publishes a notice to say that a draft plan is
available. This plan is put on public display for at least 10 weeks. You can
make submissions on what the local authority is proposing at this stage. If
applicable, you can also participate at the amended draft plan stage.

Some organisations in your area are consulted and asked to give any specialist
advice and observations before the plan is finalised. For example, some state
agencies and voluntary and community organisations.

Local authorities may also hold public consultations about development plans.
They can do this [ online or in person
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2020/act/27/enacted/en/print.html) .

All submissions that are made within the specified timeframes must be
considered before the final development plan is adopted.
