##  What is a development plan?

A development plan describes how your local authority will develop and use
particular areas in your local authority area, for example:

  * Residential areas 
  * Commercial areas 
  * Industrial areas 
  * Recreational areas 
  * Agricultural areas 

It also sets out the development objectives for your local authority area,
such as plans to improve roads and local amenities.

A development plan is made up of a written statement and series of maps.
