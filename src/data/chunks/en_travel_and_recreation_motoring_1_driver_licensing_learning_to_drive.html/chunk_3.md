##  Step 1: Pass the driver theory test

The first step to learning to drive in Ireland is to pass the [ driver theory
test ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driver-theory-test/) .

The theory test is a computer-based examination of motoring rules and
practices appropriate to the [ category of vehicle ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring-1/driving-tests/driver-theory-test#lcfd4d#lcfd4d) (car,
work vehicle, bus, truck, motorcycle or moped) you want to be licenced to
drive.

The driver theory test checks your knowledge of:

  * The [ rules of the road ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/resources/rules-of-the-road)
  * Risk perception 
  * Eco-driving 
  * Hazard awareness 
  * Safe driving behaviour 

There are [ 3 things you must do ](https://theorytest.ie/book-your-theory-
test/driver-theory-test-car-bike-bus-or-truck/) to complete this step:

  1. **Revise official RSA material.** You should use the official revision materials to increase your chance of passing the test the first time. You can buy online learning subscriptions, books and CD-ROMs on the [ theory test website ](https://dttstore.prometric.com/) . You can also buy the [ official Learning App ](https://theorytest.ie/learning-app/) on the App Store (IOS devices) or on Google Play (Android). 
  2. **Book a test.** You can [ book and pay for your driver theory test online. ](http://www.theorytest.ie/driver-theory-test/schedule-test/) You can take the test at [ centres throughout Ireland (pdf) ](https://theorytest.ie/wp-content/uploads/theory-test-ireland-test-centre-location-map-051017.pdf) . The test is offered in many languages, including Sign Language (ISL) and candidates with special needs [ are catered for ](https://theorytest.ie/general-information/test-day-assistance-support/) . See the [ RSA driver theory test FAQs ](https://theorytest.ie/general-information/faqs/) for more information. 
  3. **Provide appropriate ID.** The RSA has published a list of [ acceptable forms of identification ](https://theorytest.ie/id-policy-update/) you must show on the day of your theory test to be able to take the exam. You will not be allowed to take your exam and you will lose your test fee if you do not have correct identification.
