###  **Work**

John's average assessable weekly earnings are €110.

First you must find out if John's weekly means disqualify him from getting JA.
€20 per day from casual work (up to a maximum of €60) will be deducted from
his average assessable weekly earnings and then 60% of the balance will be
assessed as his weekly means.

€110 – €40 (2 days worked) = €70 x 60% = €42

John's weekly means from employment of €42 is less than the maximum amount he
would be entitled to for his circumstances (€278).

Now you know he is entitled to a certain amount of Jobseeker's Allowance the
next step is to calculate the **actual amount** of Jobseeker's Allowance he is
entitled to. To do this you must calculate his **'assessable daily
earnings'.**

He is entitled to JA only for periods of unemployment. The minimum period a
person must be unemployed in order to receive JA is 4 days in a period of 7
consecutive days. John has 4 consecutive days of unemployment. He is employed
for 2 days.

John's average assessable daily earnings are (€110 ÷ 2 days work) = €55.

Less disregard for day worked €55 - €20 = €35

60% of his assessable daily earnings of €35 = €21

Weekly means is €21 x 2 (number of days worked) = €42

John's weekly means from employment is €42
