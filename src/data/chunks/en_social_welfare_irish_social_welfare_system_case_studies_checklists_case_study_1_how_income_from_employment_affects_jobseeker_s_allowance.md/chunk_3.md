###  **This case study shows the effect of work on Jobseeker's Allowance (2024
rates)**

John is living with his partner Mary and their 2 children. He recently lost
his job as a barman but has managed to get some part-time work in a local
restaurant. He is working 2 days a week.

His assessable earnings for social welfare purposes are €110 per week
(assessable earnings are gross earnings less deductions for [ PRSI
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) , superannuation and union
dues.)

Mary cares for her mother, who lives nearby, and is getting full-rate [
Carer's Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/carers/carers-allowance/) . She is also
getting [ Child Benefit ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/families-and-children/child-benefit/) for each
of their 2 children aged under 12.

John wants to go back to bar work and has applied to a number of local pubs
and hotels. He heard that he can get [ Jobseeker's Allowance (JA)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) for the days that he is not
working and wants to know how much JA he is entitled to.

Other than Mary's social welfare payments and John's part-time work they have
no other income. However, they have savings of €17,500.

He is entitled to JA only for periods of unemployment. The minimum period a
person must be unemployed to receive JA is 4 days in a period of 7 consecutive
days.
