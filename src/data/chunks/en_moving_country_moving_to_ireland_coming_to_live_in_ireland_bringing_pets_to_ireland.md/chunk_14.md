###  Step 5 â€“ Tapeworm treatment

If you are bringing a dog into Ireland from a non-EU country, it must be
treated for tapeworm (Echinococcus multilocularis) each time you travel to
Ireland. The treatment must be given by a vet between 1 and 5 days before you
come to arrive in Ireland, and recorded in the pet passport or EU health
certificate.
