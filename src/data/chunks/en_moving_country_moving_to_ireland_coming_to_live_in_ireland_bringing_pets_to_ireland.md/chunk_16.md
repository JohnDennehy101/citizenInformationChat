###  Step 7 â€“ Compliance check

Your pet must undergo a compliance check on arrival into Ireland from a non-EU
country. This is arranged using the email addresses above.

If your pet is travelling to another EU country first and you have a check
there, then your pet does not need another check on entry into Ireland. If
however, you entered another EU country and were unable to arrange a check to
be carried out there, you must arrange a compliance check on arrival into
Ireland.
