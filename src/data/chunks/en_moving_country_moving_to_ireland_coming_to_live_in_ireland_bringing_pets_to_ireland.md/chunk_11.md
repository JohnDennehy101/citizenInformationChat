###  Step 2 â€“ Vaccination

Your pet must be vaccinated against rabies. The vaccine must be given after
the microchip is inserted.

Your pet must be at least 12 weeks old when it is vaccinated. You must wait
until the appropriate immunity has developed before you can bring the dog, cat
or ferret to Ireland. This is the time as stated on the datasheet of the
vaccination given, and must be at least 21 days after the primary vaccination
is given.

The waiting period does not apply to booster vaccinations, provided they are
given BEFORE the date the previous rabies vaccine has run out.
