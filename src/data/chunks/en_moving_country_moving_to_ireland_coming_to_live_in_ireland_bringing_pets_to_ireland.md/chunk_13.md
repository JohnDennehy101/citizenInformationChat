###  Step 4 – Blood test

Your cat, dog or ferret must get a blood test called a Rabies serological
test, if they are from a country or territory that is not a [ listed country
or territory ](http://www.pettravel.gov.ie/) . If your country is **not**
listed in the drop down menu on the Pet Travel portal, your pet needs a rabies
blood test.

You must wait at least 30 days from the rabies vaccination before your pet
gets its blood tested. The sample must be sent to an EU approved laboratory.

The blood test must show that the vaccination was successful. If it is
successful, you must wait a further 3 months from the taking of the blood
sample before travelling to Ireland.

If your pet is starting it’s journey in the EU, (e.g. Ireland to Brazil and
back again), you do not have to wait 3 months in Brazil if the blood sample
was taken by a vet in the EU or one of the following countries, and entered
into an EU pet passport or EU health certificate **before** leaving Ireland:

  * Andorra 
  * Gibraltar 
  * Greenland 
  * Faroe Islands 
  * Iceland 
  * Lichtenstein 
  * Monaco 
  * Northern Ireland 
  * Norway 
  * San Marino 
  * Switzerland 
  * Vatican City State 

You must bring the original test certificate, or a copy received from the lab,
with you when you come to Ireland.

If the blood test is taken in a non-EU country, the three month waiting period
will always apply.
