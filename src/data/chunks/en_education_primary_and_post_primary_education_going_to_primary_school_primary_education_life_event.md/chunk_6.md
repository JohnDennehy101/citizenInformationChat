##  Absence or changing school

If your child cannot attend school you must tell the school the reason for the
absence. Write a short note to the school to explain why your child was out
and send it in with your child when they go back to school.

If you are changing school you should tell the school that your child is
leaving and will not be returning. You can ask the principal to give you a
report on your child's progress which can be given to the new school when you
are enrolling your child.
