##  How to make a complaint

If you have a complaint about a car that you have rented in Ireland, first go
to the company and ask them to fix the problem. If you are still not
satisfied, contact the [ Car Rental Council of Ireland
](http://www.carrentalcouncil.ie/) who have a complaints procedure for member
companies.

If you have a complaint with a car rental company in another EU member state,
contact the [ European Consumer Centre ](https://www.eccireland.ie/) for
advice on your rights and help with your complaint.
