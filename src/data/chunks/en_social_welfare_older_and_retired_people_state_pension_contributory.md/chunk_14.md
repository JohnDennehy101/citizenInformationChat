###  **If you reached pension age before 1 September 2012**

If you reached pension age **before 1 September 2012** , you must have a
yearly average number of PRSI contributions (paid or [ credited contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) ) from
the year you first started paying PRSI, to the end of the tax year before you
reach pension age.

This is probably the most complex aspect of qualifying for a State Pension
(Contributory). There is the ‘normal average rule _’_ and the ‘alternative
average rule’.
