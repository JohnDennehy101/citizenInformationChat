##  What is the State Pension (Contributory)?

You can get the State Pension (Contributory) from the age of 66 if you have
enough [ social insurance (PRSI) contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/social-insurance/) . It is sometimes called the
old-age pension.

The State Pension (Contributory) is not means tested. You can get it even if
you have other income, such as an occupational pension.

As the social insurance (PRSI) conditions are very complex, you should apply
for a State Pension (Contributory) if you have ever worked in Ireland and have
paid PRSI contributions (stamps) at any time.

If you [ retire early ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments/older-and-retired-people/early-retirement/) ,
make sure you continue [ paying PRSI contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/voluntary-prsi-contributions/) , or that you are
getting [ credited contributions
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) (if you
are eligible). This can help you get a contributory pension when you reach
pension age.
