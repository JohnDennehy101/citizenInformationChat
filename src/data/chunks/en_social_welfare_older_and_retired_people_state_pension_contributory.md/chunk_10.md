####  **Self-employed**

There are special rules on entry into insurance for self-employed people. PRSI
for self-employed people was introduced on 6 April 1988. If you started paying
self-employed PRSI on 6 April 1988 and had previously paid employee PRSI at
any time, then your date of entry into insurance can be either 6 April 1988,
or the date when you first paid employee PRSI, whichever would give you a
higher rate of pension.

If you started paying self-employed PRSI after 6 April 1988, your date of
entry into insurance will be the date your first contribution was paid.
