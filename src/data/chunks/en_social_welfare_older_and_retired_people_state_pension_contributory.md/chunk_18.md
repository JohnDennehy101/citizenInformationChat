####  **If you spent time working in the home (caring)**

The DSP can ‘disregard’ (not take into account) up to 20 years spent as a
homemaker when calculating your yearly average. This [ Homemakers’ Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-insurance-prsi/homemakers-scheme/) can only be used when
calculating your yearly average number of contributions. See ‘Carers and the
State Pension (Contributory)’ below.
