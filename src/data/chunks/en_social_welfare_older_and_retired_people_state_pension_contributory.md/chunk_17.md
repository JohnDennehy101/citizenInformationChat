####  **How your average is assessed**

The DSP assesses your pension application using both the normal average and
the alternative average.

The alternative average will probably be looked at first because it is easier
to assess. Most employed or formerly employed people will be able to meet the
alternative average rule of 48 contributions.

If you do not have an average of 48 contributions from 1979, then the DSP will
assess your application using the normal average rule. You may get a reduced
pension. If you do not meet the alternative average, it is almost impossible
for you to have an average of 48 using the normal average rule.
