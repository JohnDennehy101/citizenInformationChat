##  How to apply for a maintenance order

Most applications for maintenance are made in the District Court. In some
situations, an application can be made in the Circuit Court or the High Court.
Each court has its own rules on how to apply for a court order. Currently, in
the District Court:

  * A judge can only order a maximum of €500 per week be paid to a spouse and up to a maximum of €150 per week per child. The court order will specify how the maintenance is to be paid. 
  * The highest lump sum that can be paid is €15,000. The court may also specify how this sum is to be used. 

If you are making an application for maintenance in the District Court, you
can apply to the District Court office in the area you or the respondent is
working or living in.

The person making an application for maintenance to the court is called the
applicant. The person receiving an application is called the respondent.
