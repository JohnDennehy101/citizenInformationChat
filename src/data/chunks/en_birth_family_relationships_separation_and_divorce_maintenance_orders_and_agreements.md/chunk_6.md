###  Maintenance order

If you both cannot agree, either of you can apply for a maintenance order.
This is a court order made by a judge setting out the terms of financial
support for the applicant and/or any dependent children.

Maintenance can be awarded to a spouse/civil partner for their own benefit
and/or for the benefit of a dependent child. A dependent child is:

  * Under 18 years old, or 
  * Over 18 and under 23 years old but still in full-time education or who would be in full-time education if a maintenance order was made for their support, or 
  * A child of any age with a mental or physical disability that means that they cannot maintain themselves 

Both of you must disclose your finances to the court. When deciding on a
maintenance order, a judge will consider:

  * Income such as income from employment, social welfare benefits, or other sources 
  * Assets such as land, property, vehicles, or other assets 
  * Expenditure such as household bills, loan repayments, the costs of raising children, or other expenses you have 
  * Supports for other people such as maintenance payments for other dependent children 

If you are seeking a maintenance order, check to see if you are eligible for
legal aid, or contact a private solicitor to assess the cost of the
application. You can also choose to represent yourself.
