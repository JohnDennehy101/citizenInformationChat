##  What is maintenance?

Parents, whether married or not, must support their dependent children, and
spouses or civil partners must support each other according to their financial
ability.

A financially dependent qualified cohabitant may be able to apply to the
courts for a maintenance order if the relationship ends. For more information,
see our page on the [ Redress scheme for cohabiting couples ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/problems-in-marriages-and-other-relationships/redress-
scheme-for-cohabiting-couples/) .

A former spouse/civil partner who has since remarried cannot seek maintenance
for themselves. However, they can still seek maintenance for any dependent
children.
