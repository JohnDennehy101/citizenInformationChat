##  Enforcing a maintenance order

Sometimes, a parent/spouse/civil partner does not comply with a maintenance
order and does not pay the amount of maintenance awarded. In this case, you
can look for an attachment of earnings order from the court, if the person
refusing to pay is in employment or on a private pension. This order means the
maintenance is deducted from the source of the income, for example, the
personâ€™s wages or pension. If the person refusing to pay is self-employed, an
enforcement summons can be applied for in respect of unpaid money.

The [ Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 (pdf)
](http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=/documents/bills28/acts/2011/a2311.pdf)
gives the District Court the power to regard a failure by a person to comply
with a court order as contempt of court and to deal with it accordingly,
including the possibility of imprisonment.

The District Court, in making a maintenance order, can instruct that the
payment under the order is made to the District Court clerk if appropriate.
The District Court has a payments system for the receipt and transmission of
payments received.
