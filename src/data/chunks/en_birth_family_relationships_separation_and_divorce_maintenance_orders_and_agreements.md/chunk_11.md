##  Varying the amount of maintenance

It is advisable to review weekly maintenance payments every year. Where
maintenance orders have been made through the courts, either of you can, at a
later date, apply to the court to have the amount varied (varied means having
the amount increased or decreased) or discharged (discharged means the
maintenance obligation is ended). To do this, you will need a variation or
discharge order.
