####  **How their pension was calculated**

Their average is measured in the usual way, and if that average is 10 or more,
they get a pension in the normal way. However, if it is between 5 and 9, they
may get a special partial pension which is one quarter of the maximum pension.

Only people who had a broken insurance record and who re-entered insurance in
1974 because of the removal of the income limit, could apply for this pro-rata
pension. If you re-entered insurance in that year for any other reason (for
example, because you had previously been self-employed or out of the country),
you do not meet these specific terms and you would not be eligible for this
pro-rata pension.

If you qualified for this pro-rata pension, you could also get the appropriate
Increase for Qualified Adult for a dependent spouse, civil partner or
cohabitant, and an Increase for a Qualified Child.

This pro-rata pension is for [ State Pension (Contributory) ](/en/social-
welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) and [ Widow’s,
Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner’s Contributory Pension
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/death-related-benefits/widowed-persons-contrib-pension/) only.
Because it is easier to qualify for a Widow’s, Widower’s or Surviving Civil
Partner’s Contributory Pension, the numbers who need the pro-rata pensions are
very small.
