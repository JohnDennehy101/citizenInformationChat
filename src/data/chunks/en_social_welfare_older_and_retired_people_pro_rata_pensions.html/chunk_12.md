###  **Pro-rata pension for self-employed people**

Self-employed people have had to pay social insurance since 1988. Before that,
some self-employed people voluntarily paid insurance.

Some self-employed people were already over the minimum age when they first
started to pay contributions in 1988. In April 1999, a special pro-rata
pension was introduced for them.

Only people aged 56 or over on 6 April 1988 (born on or before 6 April 1932)
qualify for this pension.
