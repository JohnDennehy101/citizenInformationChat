###  What happens after I make a complaint?

If your complaint is accepted, the Press Ombudsman will send a copy to the
editor of the publication. It will then try to resolve the issue through
mediation. This may take up to 6 weeks.

If agreement cannot be reached, the Ombudsman will carry out a more detailed
investigation and make a decision. The decision will be sent to you and to the
publication concerned. The decision can be anonymised if you prefer.

If the Ombudsman reaches a decision in your favour, the publication concerned
must publish the decision, unless it has been appealed. The decision is also
published on the Press Ombudsmanâ€™s website.
