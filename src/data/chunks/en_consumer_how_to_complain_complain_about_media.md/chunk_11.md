###  Can I contact BAI instead of the broadcaster?

You can make a complaint directly to the BAI, without having to complain to
the broadcaster first, where any of the following applies:

  * The complaint relates to your privacy or the privacy of a person for whom you are responsible (for example, a child) 
  * The complaint relates to programmes or advertisement that mention you or your organisation 
  * A request for anonymity is granted by the BAI on your request 
  * You provide an acceptable reason why the complaint should be not be sent to the broadcaster first
