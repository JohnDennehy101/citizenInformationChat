###  How do I complain to the company?

If you want to complain about material that you have seen or heard on an Irish
broadcasting service, make a complaint directly with the broadcaster first.

Put your complaint in writing within 30 days of the broadcast. If you are
complaining about 2 or more related broadcasts you must send your complaint
within 30 days of the last programme. If you are complaining about 2 separate
and unrelated broadcasts, you must complain within 30 days of the first
broadcast.

When writing your complaint, you should provide:

  * The date and time of the broadcast and the channel it was broadcast on 
  * Relevant broadcasting codes or legislation (or both) 
  * A short detailed summary of what caused offence 

The broadcaster should have a set timeframe to provide you with a response
(for example, 20 days).

If you do not receive a reply, or you are not happy with the reply, you can
complain in writing to the BAI for free.
