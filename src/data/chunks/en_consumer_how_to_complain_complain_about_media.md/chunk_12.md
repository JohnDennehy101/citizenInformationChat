###  How do I complain to the BAI?

The types of complaints that the BAI investigate include:

  * Impartiality in news and current affairs 
  * Material that causes harm or offence 
  * Law and order 
  * Where you believe your right to privacy has been breached 
  * Codes of standards and practice in relation to advertising, teleshopping, sponsorship and commercial promotion 

You cannot complain to the BAI about broadcasts received in Ireland but
licensed in another country such as the United Kingdom. The BAI has more
information about the [ broadcasting codes and standards
](https://www.bai.ie/en/codes-standards/) .

Send your complaint within 14 days of the broadcaster’s decision or after a
reasonable amount of time has passed and you have not received a response.

If you send your complaint to the BAI after the 14 day deadline, it may still
consider the case (at its discretion) but you will have to give an explanation
for the delay.

When assessing your complaint the BAI will consider the following:

  * The matters identified in the complaint 
  * The relevant Code 
  * The provisions of the [ Broadcasting Act 2009 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/18/enacted/en/html)
  * The provisions of the [ Audiovisual Media Services Directive 2010/13/EU ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=CELEX:32010L0013&qid=1426782714365)
  * The procedures, practices and policies of the BAI 

The BAI will decide if the broadcaster has respected the relevant codes and
legislation. Both you and the broadcaster will be sent a copy of the decision.

The decision will be published on the BAI’s website and given to the media,
unless the BAI considers it inappropriate to do so. The publication will
include details of the decision and will include the name of the broadcaster,
the programme or advertisement complained about, and the name of the
complainant.

The BAI cannot award costs or expenses to any party.
