##  Introduction

If you care for a child on your own, you may be able to claim a tax credit
called the Single Person Child Carer Credit (SPCCC). [ Tax credits reduce the
amount of tax that you have to pay ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-
your-tax-is-calculated/) .

The SPCCC is given to the person who lives with the child for the whole or
greater part of the year (more than 6 months) â€“ called the _primary claimant_
.

If you are a primary claimant, you can give up your entitlement to the credit
to another person, called a _secondary claimant_ , if the child lives with
them for more than 100 days in a year and they meet all the other qualifying
conditions.
