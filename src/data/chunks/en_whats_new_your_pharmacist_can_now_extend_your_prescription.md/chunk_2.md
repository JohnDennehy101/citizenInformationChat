From 1 September 2024, if you have a 6-month prescription, you may be able to
get your pharmacist to extend your prescription for a 12-month period in
total.

Your 6-month prescription must be dated 1 March 2024 or later. Prescriptions
that are written after 1 March 2024 for other periods cannot be extended by a
pharmacist.

An extension will not be automatic and certain medications will not be
eligible.

The change means you wonâ€™t always need to see your GP to get your prescription
extended.
