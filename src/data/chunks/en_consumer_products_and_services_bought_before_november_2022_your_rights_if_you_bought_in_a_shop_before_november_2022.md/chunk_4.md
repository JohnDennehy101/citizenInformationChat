##  Returning something you do notwant

You have no automatic right to a refund if you change your mind about goods
you bought in a shop. If there is nothing wrong with the item, you have no
legal right to return it. Whether you can get your money back depends on the
sellerâ€™s returns policy.

Most sellers allow you to return or replace goods during a certain period. The
seller can offer a refund, exchange or credit note as a goodwill gesture.

If the seller accepts returns, you should:

  * Make sure the items are in good condition 
  * Keep the original labels and tags attached 
  * Have proof of purchase (for example, a receipt)
