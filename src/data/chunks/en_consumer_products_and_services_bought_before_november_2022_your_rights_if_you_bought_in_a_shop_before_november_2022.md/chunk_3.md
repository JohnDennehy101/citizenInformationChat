##  Your rights

When you bought the goods, you made a contract with the seller. Under the
contract, you and the seller have certain legal rights and obligations.

You have the same rights whether you bought at full price, reduced price (for
example, in a sale) or bought a second-hand good (if bought from a business).

In some cases, you are restricted by a seller’s shop policy or terms and
conditions, for example where you simply change your mind – see ‘Returning
products you do not want’ below.

**Quality, performance and durability**

Under the [ Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1980/act/16/enacted/en/html) , the goods
you bought must meet standards of quality, performance and durability.

Goods must be:

  * **Of satisfactory (merchantable) quality** taking into account durability and price 
  * **Fit for the purpose** you bought it 
  * **As described,** matching any description advertised or other information the seller gave you
