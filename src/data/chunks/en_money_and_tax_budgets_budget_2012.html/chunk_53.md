####  Mortgage Interest Supplement

The minimum contribution for the purposes of the Mortgage Interest Supplement
scheme will be increased to €30 per week for a single person (from €24 per
week). The minimum contribution payable by couples will be €35 per week.
(January 2012)

Payment of Mortgage Interest Supplement will be deferred for 12 months while
the person engages with the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process. This approach
is consistent with the reports of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Group
and the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears. (2012)

People getting Mortgage Interest Supplement will be granted a waiver from the
new €100 Household Charge.
