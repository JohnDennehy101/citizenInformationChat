The student contribution is increased by €250 per year from the academic year
2012/2013.

The student grant is reduced by 3%. This reduction applies to existing and new
grant-holders from January 2012. The value of certain capital assets will be
taken into account in the means test for student grants from 2013.

the special rate of student grant will now only get a fee grant. They will not
get a maintenance grant. A €2,000 fee grant will be paid to a further 4,000
students. Existing grant-holders will not be affected.

The allocation to the Fund for Students with Disabilities is reduced by 20%.

The 5 scholarship schemes for higher education will be replaced by a single
bursary-type, merit-based scheme, with awards of €2,000 per student.

Core funding for higher education is reduced by 2%.

The Technological Sector research programme will be terminated.
