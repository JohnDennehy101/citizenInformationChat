####  Action Plan for Jobs

The Government recently committed to deliver a multi-annual Action Plan for
Jobs, with quarterly targets for delivery every year and a monitoring group to
oversee implementation. The Action Plan for Jobs will address 7 principal
areas:

  * Improving competitiveness and intensifying competition in sheltered sectors 
  * Supporting indigenous start-ups 
  * Assisting indigenous business to grow 
  * Attracting inward entrepreneurial start-ups 
  * Developing and deepening the impact of Foreign Direct Investment 
  * Developing employment initiatives within the community 
  * Exploiting sectoral opportunities, identified as priorities 

A Micro Finance Loan Fund, to provide loans on a commercial basis for start-up
businesses and micro-enterprises will operate from early 2012. It is expected
that the businesses that will primarily benefit will be those at the margins
of commercial lending decisions.

The Temporary Partial Loan Guarantee Scheme is expected to be in place in the
first quarter of 2012. Under the Scheme, the Government will partially
guarantee loans by traditional lenders to viable businesses that are at the
margins of commercial lending decisions and have difficulties accessing
credit.
