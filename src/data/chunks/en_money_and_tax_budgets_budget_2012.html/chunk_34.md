####  Jobseekerâ€™s Benefit and Allowance

Where a Jobseeker's Benefit recipient is working for part of a week, the
payment entitlement will be based on a 5-day week rather than a 6-day week.
This means that for each day that a person is unemployed, one-fifth of the
normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit is payable and if they get part-time work
for 2 days, they will get three-fifths of the normal Jobseeker's Benefit for
that week. (July 2012)

Sunday working will be taken into account when calculating the amount of
Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance to be paid. (January 2013)
