####  Carbon tax

The carbon tax will be increased by €5 to €20 per tonne of CO2 emitted on
fossil fuels.

The increase will apply to petrol and auto-diesel from midnight, 6 December
2011\. Find out more about the impact of this change on page 21 of the [
Taxation Annexes document (pdf)
](http://budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2012/Documents/Taxation%20Annexes%20to%20the%20Summary%20of%202012%20Budget%20and%20Estimates%20Measures.pdf)
.

The increase will apply from 1 May 2012 to kerosene, Marked Gas Oil, Liquid
Petroleum Gas (LPG), fuel oil and natural gas. (This is to take account of the
effect the increase would have on home heating costs over the winter months.)

The carbon tax will not apply to solid fuels, so there will be no increases
for peat or coal.
