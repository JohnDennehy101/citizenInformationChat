####  Household charge

A household charge of â‚¬100 is being introduced in 2012. The charge is an
interim measure pending design and implementation of a full property tax in
2014\. Homeowners (not tenants) are liable for the household charge. The
charge does not apply to social housing or housing provided by a charity.
There will be a waiver for those on Mortgage Interest Supplement and for those
residing in certain categories of unfinished housing estates. Provision will
also be made to allow payment of the charge in instalments. This charge will
fund local services, in line with the requirement in the EU/IMF Programme of
Financial Support for Ireland.
