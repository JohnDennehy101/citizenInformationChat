####  Betting duty

It is proposed to extend betting duty of 1% to remote betting and to introduce
a betting intermediariesâ€™ duty (Gross Profits Tax of 15%) to cover betting
exchanges. This provision is being legislated for in the Betting (Amendment)
Bill. Following publication of the Bill there is a legal requirement to notify
the EU Commission 3 months before enactment of the Bill. It is intended that
the new taxation regime will commence from the second quarter of 2012.
