####  Household charge

A household charge of €100 is being introduced in 2012. This charge will fund
local services, in line with the requirement in the EU/IMF Programme of
Financial Support for Ireland. The charge is an interim measure pending design
and implementation of a full property tax in 2014.

Homeowners (not tenants) will be liable for the household charge. The charge
does not apply to social housing or housing provided by a charity. There will
be a waiver for those on Mortgage Interest Supplement and for those residing
in certain categories of unfinished housing estates. Provision will also be
made to allow payment of the charge in instalments.
