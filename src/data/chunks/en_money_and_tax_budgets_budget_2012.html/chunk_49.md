####  Disability Allowance

The age of entitlement for Disability Allowance will increase to 18 years in
line with other social welfare payments. The age of entitlement for
Domiciliary Care Allowance will be extended from 16 years to 18 years of age.
**(This measure was announced on 6 December. On 7 December it was announced
that this measure is under review and may not be implemented.)**

For new claimants aged 18 to 24, the rates of payment for Disability Allowance
will be aligned with Jobseeker's Allowance rates for that age group (€100 per
week for people aged 18 to 21 and €144 per week for people aged 22 to 24).
**(This measure was announced on 6 December. On 7 December it was announced
that this measure is under review and may not be implemented.)**

People who are aged under 25 years and are already getting a full-rate
Disability Allowance payment will not be affected. If people under 25, who are
currently getting Disability Allowance, take up opportunities for education or
training (for example, by availing of the Back-to-Education scheme or
Community Employment) or leave the country and subsequently revert to
Disability Allowance, they will not be subject to the reduced rates.
