##  How do I take my complaint further?

If you have not received a response within the timeline set out by the
company, or you are not satisfied with the response, you can bring your
complaint to the CRU.

The CRU’s customer care teams can help you with issues you have with your
energy supplier or network operator, or with Uisce Éireann (previously called
Irish Water). The CRU is an approved body for [ alternative dispute resolution
](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/alternative-dispute-resolution/) .

The CRU will only investigate a complaint after you have gone through the
normal complaints process of the energy supplier or network, or Uisce Éireann
(previously called Irish Water), and the issue is not resolved or you are not
satisfied with the supplier’s response.

To make a complaint with the CRU, you must [ fill out a complaint form
](https://www.cru.ie/home/complaint-form/energy/log-complaint-cru/#the-
complaint-resolution-process-step-by-step) and provide this to the customer
care team.
