##  Introduction

If you are not receiving the service you expect from your energy or water
supplier, or if something goes wrong, you may want to make a complaint. All
gas and electricity companies, as well as Uisce Éireann (previously called
Irish Water), must have a complaints handling process in place for their
customers.

If you have a problem with your gas or electricity service, you should first
discuss your problem with your gas or electricity supplier. If the problem is
with your water supply, and you are connected to the public mains, you should
contact Uisce Éireann (previously called Irish Water).

If you have followed the complaints process and you are not satisfied with the
response, you can refer the complaint to the [ Commission for Regulation of
Utilities (CRU) ](https://www.cru.ie/) . The CRU is a statutory body
responsible for regulation of the energy and water sector in Ireland and can
investigate your complaint.
