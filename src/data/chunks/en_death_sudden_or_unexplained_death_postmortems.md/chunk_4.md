###  Coronerâ€™s post-mortem

A coroner is an independent judicial office holder who investigates unexpected
deaths. They will ask for a post-mortem in the case of a violent, sudden or
unnatural death or as part of a criminal investigation, and may use its
findings at an [ inquest ](/en/death/sudden-or-unexplained-death/inquests-and-
inquest-reports/) .

If a coroner has ordered the post-mortem, they do not need to ask permission
from the next of kin, because they have a legal duty to investigate certain
types of death.
