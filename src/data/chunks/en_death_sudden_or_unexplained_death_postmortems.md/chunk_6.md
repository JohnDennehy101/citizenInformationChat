##  What happens in a post-mortem?

The pathologist examines the outside of the body and opens the body and
examines the organs. They will usually take tissue samples and more rarely may
remove organs for detailed examination to establish the cause of death. In
most cases they put the organs back, but may occasionally need to keep them
for more tests.

When the pathologist is done with the samples they will be respectfully
disposed of by the hospital. In most cases this will take place about four
months later. It is possible instead to have the tissues returned to you for
burial or cremation, and you should say that this is what you want to happen
when the post-mortem is arranged.

The HSE has published [ Standards and Recommended Practices for Post Mortem
Examination Services (pdf)
](https://www.lenus.ie/bitstream/handle/10147/628088/Standards%20and%20recommended%20practices%20for%20post%20mortem%20examination%20services.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
. This clarifies doctorsâ€™ responsibility to seek the consent of the family
before retaining organs and lays out standards of communication for doctors to
use with families.
