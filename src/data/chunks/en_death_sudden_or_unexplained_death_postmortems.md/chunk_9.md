##  Can organ donation go ahead after a post-mortem?

If someone is a registered organ donor, but their death has to be reported to
a coroner, the coroner and next of kin must give permission before organs can
be donated. The coroner will decide the matter after consulting the Garda√≠ and
doctors. Where the coroner grants permission for donation, the post-mortem
examination will be limited.

In general, the coroner will agree to requests for organ donation where
possible. Read more about [ body and organ donation in Ireland
