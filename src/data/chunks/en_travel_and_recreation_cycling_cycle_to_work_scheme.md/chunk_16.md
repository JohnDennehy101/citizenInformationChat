###  **Step 5: You repay your employer in instalments**

Your employer then sets up salary deductions over an agreed period of up to 12
months to recover the costs.

Depending on your salary arrangements, these deductions can be made weekly,
fortnightly or monthly.

**Do not pay for the bike directly**

Please note that your employer must pay for the bike. The tax exemption does
not apply if you pay for the bike and your employer reimburses you.
