##  What properties are not liable to Vacant Homes Tax?

VHT does not apply to properties that have been lived in for 30 days in the
chargeable period.

Even if the property has not been lived in for 30 days, VHT does not apply
(and you do not need to make a return or payment) if the property:

  * Changed ownership during the chargeable period 
  * Was [ exempt from Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax-exemptions/)
  * Was rented for at least 30 days to a [ registered tenant ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/landlords-rights-and-responsibilities/registering-a-tenancy/) who is not related to the owner or a [ connected person ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/39/section/10/enacted/en/html#sec10)

**Connected person**

If you are the owner, a connected person is:

  * Your spouse or civil partner or 
  * A relative of you or your spouse or civil partner or 
    * That relativeâ€™s spouse or civil partner 

_Relative_ means a:

  * Brother or sister 
  * Ancestor (someone you are descended from) 
  * Lineal descendant (someone descended from you)
