##  Who must pay Vacant Homes Tax?

If a property is liable to VHT, it is paid by the [ person who pays Local
Property Tax ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/#l58249) on the property.
This is usually the owner.

If there are joint owners, they should nominate one owner who will be
responsible for making VHT returns and payments.

If you do not think your property is liable, Revenue may ask you to confirm
that it is not liable and may ask you to make a VHT return. You should keep [
records to show the use of the property
