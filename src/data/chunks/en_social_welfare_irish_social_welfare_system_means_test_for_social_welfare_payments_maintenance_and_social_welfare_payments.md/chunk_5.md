####  **Rent or mortgage costs**

If you have housing costs, your rent or mortgage repayment up to a maximum of
â‚¬95.23 per week can be offset against maintenance payments. Half the balance
is then assessed as means. You must show proof of rent or mortgage payments.

If you do not have any housing costs, half of your means from maintenance is
assessed.
