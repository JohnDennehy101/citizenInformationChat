##  What maintenance is assessed as means?

If you are applying for a [ social assistance payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/social-assistance-payments/social-assistance-in-ireland/) , you must
pass a means test. The Department of Social Protection (DSP) looks at all your
sources of income, such as:

  * Wages from employment 
  * Capital (savings and investments) 
  * Other cash income 
  * Maintenance (excluding child maintenance) 

If you are getting maintenance from more than one person, it will be added
together, and the total will be assessed as means. The DSP also takes
maintenance paid to your spouse, civil partner, or cohabitant is into account.
