##  How maintenance is assessed for Working Family Payment

Only one [ Working Family Payment ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-
children/working-family-payment/) (WFP) can be made for any family.

This means that if you are applying for WFP, the parent from whom you are
getting maintenance must not be getting WFP.

You cannot offset your housing costs against maintenance payments for WFP, if
you have already done so in the means test for another social welfare payment.
