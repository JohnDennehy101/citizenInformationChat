##  What is maintenance?

Parents, whether married or not, must support their dependent children.
Similarly, spouses and civil partners must support each other according to
their financial ability. If partners separate, one person may pay maintenance
to the other person, to help them with living costs.

Maintenance can be paid voluntarily, or as a result of a ‘maintenance order’
granted by the courts. You can read more about [ how to apply for maintenance
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-
and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) .

This page explains how maintenance is assessed in the [ means test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/means-test-for-social-welfare-payments/means-test/) for a social
assistance payment.
