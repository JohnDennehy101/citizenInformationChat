####  Example of how maintenance is assessed

**Example of how maintenance is assessed in a calculation of means**  
---  
A single parent with one child is getting maintenance of €300. The
_maintenance order_ specifies €100 for the parent and €200 for the child (the
€200 for the child is not included in the means test). Rent is €150 per week
(€95.23 of which is offset against maintenance payments).  Maintenance:
€300.00  
Minus child maintenance: €200  Minus rent: €95.23  
Total: €4.77  
(Only half assessed as means)  
**Total means from maintenance: €2.38**
