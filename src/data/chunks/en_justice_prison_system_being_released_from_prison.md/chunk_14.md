###  **The Parole Board**

[ The Parole Board ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation/parole-board/) reviews
parole applications from prisoners serving life sentences. It is an
independent statutory body and the [ Board members
](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/f2b2e-who-we-are/) are
appointed by the Minister for Justice.

The Parole Board must notify you when you become eligible for parole. You can
apply for parole once you become eligible. The Irish Prison Service keeps the
Parole Board updated on which prisoners are eligible to apply for parole.

You must meet the following criteria for parole:

  * You must have served at least 10 and a half years of your sentence before you can apply for parole 
  * You must have served at least 12 years of your life sentence before you can be granted parole 

Some offences, such as capital murder, certain sexual offences, drug and
gangland related offences are subject to minimum terms of imprisonment. You
will not be eligible for parole in these cases until that minimum sentence is
served.

When considering your application, the Parole Board may request reports from
relevant services, including:

  * [ The Irish Prison Service ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/prison-system/prison-system-in-ireland/)
  * The Irish Prison Service Psychology Service 
  * The Probation Service 
  * [ An Garda Síochána ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-siochana-national-police-force/)
  * A psychiatrist and/or a psychologist 
  * Any other source relevant to your case
