####  **The ‘Gaining Access to Training and Employment’ (GATE) Service**

The GATE Service can provide guidance counselling and help you with finding
training or employment after your release from prison.

You need to have less than 18 months left on your sentence and you need to be
referred to the service by someone from the prison, such as the Governor,
Chief Officer, Chaplain, etc.
