###  Eligibility for temporary release

When assessing an application for temporary release, the Minister will
consider several factors, including:

  * The nature and circumstances of the crime you committed 
  * Your behaviour in custody and on any previous period of temporary release 
  * The length of sentence served 
  * Whether you pose a threat to anyone, if released 
  * The risk of you not returning at the end of the temporary release 
  * Whether temporary release would help you reintegrate into society 

If you are granted temporary release, you must:

  * Keep the peace and maintain good behaviour 
  * Maintain sober habits 
  * Return to prison before the temporary release period expires 
  * Comply with any other condition imposed 

You will sign a release form acknowledging that:

  * You are aware of the terms and conditions of your release 
  * Those terms have been explained to you 
  * You are aware of the time when your period of release ends 

While you are outside the prison, you may be considered to be unlawfully at
large and may be arrested if your period of release has ended, or you break a
condition of your release.
