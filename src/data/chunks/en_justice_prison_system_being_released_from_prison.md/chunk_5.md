###  Enhanced remission

You can apply to the Minister for Justice for enhanced remission to reduce
your sentence by one third.

For example, if you are sentenced to 3 years in prison and you are granted
enhanced remission of one third of your sentence, you may be released after 2
years.

To be eligible for enhanced remission:

  * You must be able to demonstrate good behaviour (for example, by engaging in authorised structured activities in prison) 
  * The Minister for Justice must be satisfied that you are unlikely to reoffend and that you can reintegrate into the community upon release
