##  Remission

Remission is the complete ending of a sentence before the full term of your
sentence has been completed.

If you are in prison and part of your sentence is remitted (reduced), you are
released into the community without any further supervision or restrictions.

For example, if you were sentenced to 8 years in prison, you may be released
after 6 years because the remaining 2 years of your sentence have been
remitted.

Remission does not apply if you are:

  * Serving a life sentence (see ‘Parole’ below) 
  * In prison as a debtor or because of contempt of court 

There are 2 forms of remission set out under [ Article 59 of the Prison Rules
2007 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2007/si/252/made/en/print#article59)
: standard remission and enhanced remission.
