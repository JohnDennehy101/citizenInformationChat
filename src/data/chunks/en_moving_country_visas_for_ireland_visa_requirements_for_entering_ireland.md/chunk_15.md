##  Do I need preclearance?

If you do not need a visa to come to Ireland, you may still have to apply for
preclearance. Preclearance is permission to enter Ireland to apply to reside
for certain reasons. You have to apply for preclearance if you want to come to
Ireland:

  * To [ volunteer ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-work-in-ireland/what-are-my-options-for-working-in-ireland/coming-to-work-for-more-than-90-days/volunteer/)
  * As a [ minister of religion ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-work-in-ireland/what-are-my-options-for-working-in-ireland/coming-to-work-for-more-than-90-days/minister-of-religion/)
  * As the [ de facto partner of a Critical Skills Employment Permit or Hosting Agreement holder ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-eea-or-swiss-national/de-facto-partner-of-a-critical-skills-employment-permit-holder-csep-or-hosting-agreement-holder-ha/)
  * As the [ de facto partner of an Irish citizen ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-an-irish-national/de-facto-partner-of-an-irish-national/)
  * As the [ family member of a UK citizen ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-your-uk-national-family-member/)

A de facto partnership is when you are in a relationship with someone that is
like a marriage.

You can apply for pre-clearance online. If you are approved, and you intend to
stay in Ireland for more than 3 months, you have to register for an Irish
Residence Permit after you arrive in Ireland.
