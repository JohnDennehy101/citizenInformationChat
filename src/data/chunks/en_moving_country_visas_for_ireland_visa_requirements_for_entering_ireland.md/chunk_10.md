###  Re-entry multiple entry visas

The first visa issued to you is valid for a single entry to the State. If you
leave Ireland, you must apply for another visa to travel to Ireland again.

If you have had single entry visas in the past and you have obeyed the
conditions of those visas, you can apply for a multiple entry visa. You can
also apply if you need to come to Ireland frequently for business. A multiple
entry visa allows you to travel to Ireland on more than one occasion during
the period that the visa is valid.
