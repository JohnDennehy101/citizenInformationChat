##  School Student Visa Waiver

School students who are citizens of a country that would normally need a visa
to enter Ireland can apply for a waiver if they live in an EU or EEA country
and are travelling as part of a school trip.

The principal of the school must complete an [ application form
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Visa-Waiver-for-
non-EEA-and-EU-School-Students-v2.pdf) and present this form to immigration
