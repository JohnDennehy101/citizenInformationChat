###  Who does not pay the fee?

[ Some applicants are not required to pay a fee
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/preclearance-and-entry-visas-fees/) . This
includes visa-required spouses and certain family members of EEA citizens
(including Irish nationals) provided that proof of the relationship is
provided with the application. In addition, applicants from some countries are
not required to pay a fee. As this can change from time to time, you should
check with your local Irish embassy or consulate, or with the Visa Office.
