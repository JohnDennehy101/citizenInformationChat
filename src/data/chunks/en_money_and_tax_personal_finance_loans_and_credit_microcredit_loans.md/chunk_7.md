##  Repaying the loan

You must repay your loan each week from your social welfare payment through
the Household Budget Scheme or, if your credit union agrees, by direct debit
or standing order from your bank or credit union account.

The maximum deduction from your payment that is allowed under the Household
Budget Scheme is 25% of your weekly social welfare payment. This includes any
other deductions that you may already have under the Household Budget Scheme
(for example, for rent or for household bills).
