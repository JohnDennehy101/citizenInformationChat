##  Who can apply?

You can apply for an _It Makes Sense_ loan if you:

  * Are aged over 18 
  * Are getting a social welfare payment 
  * Agree to repay the loan through the [ Household Budget Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/household-budget-scheme/) if you get your social welfare payment at a post office 

If your social welfare payment is paid into a bank or credit union account,
you must repay the loan by standing order or direct debit. Check with your
credit union whether it provides this option.

You can apply for a loan for any purpose, including to repay an outstanding
debt.
