##  What is homelessness?

There are many different reasons why people become homeless. Perhaps you have
lost your rented accommodation, or had to move out of your home because your
relationship has broken down. You may be staying with family or couch surfing
with friends. Or you may be homeless for more complex reasons and have
additional needs due to addiction or mental health issues.

**What is the definition of homelessness?**

You are considered homeless if one of the following applies to you:

  * There is no accommodation available that you and any other person who normally lives with you, can reasonably stay in. This is in your local authority's opinion. 
  * You are living in a hospital, county home, night shelter or other such institution, and you are living there because you have no suitable accommodation 
  * You are unable to provide accommodation from your own resources. This is in your local authority's opinion. 

This definition of homelessness is outlined in the [ Housing Act 1988
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1988/en/act/pub/0028/index.html) .

In general, you may be considered homeless if you are:

  * Sleeping rough 
  * Staying in an emergency hostel or refuge 
  * Staying in bed and breakfast or hotel accommodation on a temporary basis 
  * Staying temporarily with friends or family because you have nowhere else to go 
  * Squatting (occupying a building illegally)
