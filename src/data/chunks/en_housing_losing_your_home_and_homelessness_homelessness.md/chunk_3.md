##  The right to housing

There is no legal right to housing in Ireland. However, local authorities have
a responsibility to provide housing for adults who cannot afford it
themselves, and [ Tusla ](/en/birth-family-relationships/services-and-
supports-for-children/tusla-the-child-and-family-agency/) must provide
accommodation for children who are homeless or in need of care.

In December 2022, the Government committed to a referendum on the right to
housing in the [ Programme for Government
](https://merrionstreet.ie/en/about/programme-for-government/) .

[ The Housing Commission ](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/2ae5e-the-housing-
commission/) was set-up to work on housing policy issues, including developing
proposals for the wording for a constitutional referendum on the right to
housing.

In late 2023, the Housing Commission completed their report. The Government is
now reviewing the report and considering the next steps.
