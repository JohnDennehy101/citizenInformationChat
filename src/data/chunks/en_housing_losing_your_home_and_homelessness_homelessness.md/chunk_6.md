##  Who monitors homelessness levels?

The number of people who are homeless is monitored to make sure there are
enough homeless services and to help develop housing policy. This is done in a
number of ways:

  * Local authorities carry out assessments of housing needs every year. The homeless people included in this assessment are those who are registered with the local authority and have been assessed as being in need of housing. The most recent [ housing need assessment ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/862a4-summary-of-social-housing-assessments-2022-key-findings/) was carried out in 2022. 
  * The Census of Population counts everyone living in Ireland every 5 years. It provides comprehensive information about the number of homeless people. 
  * The Dublin Region Homeless Executive conducts a [ rough sleeper count in the Dublin region ](https://www.homelessdublin.ie/info/figures?type=rough-sleeper-count&year=) every 6 months. 
  * The Government publish [ monthly reports on levels of homelessness ](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/80ea8-homelessness-data/) based on information gathered by local authorities.
