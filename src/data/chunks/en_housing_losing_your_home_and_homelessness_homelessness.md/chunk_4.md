##  Who is responsible for housing homeless people?

**Local authorities’ responsibilities**

Local authorities do not have a statutory obligation to house people, but they
do have general responsibility under the Housing Act 1988 to provide housing
for adults who cannot afford it for themselves. They may help with
accommodation either:

  * By providing housing directly 
  * Through arrangements with approved housing bodies and other voluntary bodies 

They may also provide funding to voluntary bodies for emergency accommodation
and for long-term housing for homeless people.

**The HSE’s responsibilities**

The [ Health Service Executive (HSE) ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/) has general
responsibility for the health and in-house care needs of homeless people. This
means that local authorities are responsible for the costs of providing
accommodation while the HSE provides funding for the care and welfare needs of
homeless people, including in-house care.

**Tusla’s responsibilities**

[ Tusla ](http://tusla.ie/) is responsible for providing accommodation for
children under 18 who are homeless or in need of care. This is outlined in the
Child Care Act 1991. They may also provide aftercare facilities for young
people aged over 18. Read more on our page on [ youth homelessness
