###  **How does it work?**

To qualify for the State Pension (Contributory), you may need a certain number
of [ yearly average PRSI contributions

people/state-pension-
contributory/#89a956:~:text=3.%20Yearly%20average%20or%20total%20number%20of%20contributions)
between starting work and reaching pension age.

But, with the Homemaker’s Scheme, the Department of Social Protection (DSP)
can ignore up to 20 years you spent as a homemaker after 6 April 1994. The DSP
calls these your ‘Homemaking years’.

This can help you to qualify for a State Pension (Contributory) or get a
higher rate of pension.

You must have 520 paid contributions when you reach pension age to use the
Homemaker's Scheme to calculate your State Pension (Contributory).
