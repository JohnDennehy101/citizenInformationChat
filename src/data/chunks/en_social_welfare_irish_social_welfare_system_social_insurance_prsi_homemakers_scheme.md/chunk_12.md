###  **Example of a person’s insurance record using the Homemaker’s Scheme**

Mary left the workforce in 1997 to care for her newborn child.

The child:

  * Was born on 10 November 1997, and 
  * Had their 12th birthday on 10 November 2009. 

So, Mary’s homemaking period is from 10 November 1997 until 10 November 2009.
