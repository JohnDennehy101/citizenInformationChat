###  **Can I swap my ‘homemaker’ status with my spouse?**

Only one person in the home can be a homemaker at a time.

If you stop being a homemaker and your spouse or civil partner takes up
homemaking duties, you should tell the Department of Social Protection (DSP)
immediately. This is to make sure there is no loss of entitlements under the
Homemaker's Scheme.
