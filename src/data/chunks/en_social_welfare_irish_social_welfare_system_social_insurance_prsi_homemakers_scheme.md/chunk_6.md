###  **Caring for someone aged 12 or over**

Before 26 October 2000, you had to live with the person you were caring for.

Now, you donâ€™t have to live with the person you care for if:

  * You have a direct system of communication with them, for example, a phone or alarm system _,_ **and**
  * The person does not get full-time care and attention within their own home from anyone else. 

To qualify for the scheme, the person you care for must be so disabled or
incapacitated that they need either:

  * Continuous supervision to avoid danger to themself, **or**
  * Continuous supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with their normal personal needs (such as getting around, eating, drinking, or dressing).
