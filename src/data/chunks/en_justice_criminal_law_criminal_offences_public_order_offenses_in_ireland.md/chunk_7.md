###  Begging in an intimidating or threatening manner

Begging in an aggressive, intimidating or threatening manner is a public order
offence. A person found guilty of this offence is liable on summary conviction
to a class E fine or up to one month in prison, or both.

The Garda√≠ can direct people begging in certain areas to leave that area, for
example, people begging at an ATM, a night safe, a vending machine or a shop
entrance. If the person does not follow the request to move they can be
charged with an offence and get a class E fine on summary conviction.

It is also an offence to organise or direct someone else to beg. On summary
conviction for this offence, you are liable to a class A fine, or up to 12
months in prison, or both.
