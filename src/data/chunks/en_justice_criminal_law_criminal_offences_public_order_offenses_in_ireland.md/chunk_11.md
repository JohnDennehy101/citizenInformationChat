##  Failure to comply with the direction of a member of An Garda Síochána

It is an offence if you do not comply with a Garda’s request to stop behaving
in a way that they believe is endangering people’s safety, property, or the
public peace.

If you are behaving in this way, the Garda can also ask you to “move on” to
avert any potential trouble. This means that they do not have to apply the
full force of criminal law by arresting you, charging you and bringing you
before the courts.

It is an offence to not follow these Garda directions, unless you have a
reasonable excuse or lawful authority to do so. Any person convicted of
failing to comply with a Garda direction in this way, is liable on summary
conviction to a class D fine, or to a maximum term of 6 months in prison, or
both.
