##  Wilful obstruction

It is an offence to deliberately prevent or interrupt a person or vehicle from
passing freely in a public place, unless you have the legal authority or a
reasonable excuse to do this. The penalty for this offence is a fine of up to
€400.

This offence was created to protect the constitutional rights of the
individual to pass on a public highway. While the Gardaí have no power to
arrest for this offence, they can direct the person to stop the obstruction.
Failure to comply with that direction is an offence.
