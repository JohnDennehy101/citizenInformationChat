##  Introduction

The law on public order offences is mainly set down in the [ Criminal Justice
(Public Order) Act 1994
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0002/index.html) . It deals
with how people behave in public places, for example, being drunk in a public
place, and also provides for [ crowd control at public events
](/en/justice/law-enforcement/crowd-control-at-public-events-in-ireland/) .
Under the law, a ‘public place’ includes roads, public parks or recreational
areas, cemeteries, churchyards, trains, buses and other public transport
vehicles.

If a Garda suspects you have committed a public order offence under this Act,
you must give them your name and address if you are asked for them. In fact,
it is an offence if you fail to give your name and address in this situation,
and you can be arrested without warrant for this.

The [ Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0016/index.html) provides
that, if you are convicted of certain offences under the 1994 Act, you can be
excluded from a premises for up to a year. This is in addition to the penalty
under the 1994 Act.
