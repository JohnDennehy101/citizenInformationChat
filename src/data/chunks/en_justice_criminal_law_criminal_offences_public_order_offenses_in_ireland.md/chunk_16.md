##  Violent disorder

Violent disorder is a public order offence which is similar to the offence of
riot. However, it is a lesser version of that offence.

Violent disorder is when 3 or more people are together at a place, and they
use or threaten to use violence, and their conduct would cause someone of
reasonable firmness, who was present at that place to fear for their or
someone elseâ€™s safety.

For the offence of riot, the accused person must have used violence, whereas
for violent disorder the accused person only needs to threaten to use
violence. For the offence of violent disorder, the group do not have to share
a common purpose, whereas this is a requirement for riot.

The maximum penalty for violent disorder is an unlimited fine, or a prison
sentence of up to 10 years, or both.
