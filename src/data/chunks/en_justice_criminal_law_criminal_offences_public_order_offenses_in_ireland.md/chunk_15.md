##  Riot

Riot is one of the major and most serious public order offences. It is defined
as when 12 or more people are together at one place and use, or threaten to
use, unlawful violence for a common purpose, and their conduct would cause
someone of reasonable firmness who was present at that place to fear for their
or someone else’s safety. Anyone using unlawful violence for the common
purpose in this way is guilty of the offence of riot.

The important parts of this offence are:

  * That at least 12 people must use or threaten to use violence 
  * They must have a common purpose in doing so 
  * Their conduct would cause a reasonable observer to fear for their safety or the safety of some other person 
  * The accused used unlawful violence 

This offence can be committed in a public or private place. The offence of
riot can be used by the Gardaí in situations where large groups of people
assemble in [ protest ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-
ireland/human-rights/right-to-protest/) and the protest turns into unlawful
violence.

The maximum penalty for the offence of riot is an unlimited fine, a prison
sentence of up to 10 years, or both.
