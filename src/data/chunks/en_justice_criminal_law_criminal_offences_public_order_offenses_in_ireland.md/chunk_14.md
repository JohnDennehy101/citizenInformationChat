##  Trespass

It is an offence to trespass in a way that is likely to cause fear in another
person. This offence does not include any intent to commit a crime or to
interfere with property. If you are found guilty of this offence, you are
liable on summary conviction to a Class C fine, or up to 12 months in prison,

If the Garda find you trespassing in a way that causes, or is likely to cause,
fear in another person, they can direct you to:

  * Stop acting in that way, and 
  * Immediately leave the area in a peaceable and orderly manner 

If you fail to comply with this direction, you are guilty of an offence,
unless you have a reasonable excuse or lawful authority not to comply. If you
are found guilty of this offence, you are liable to a class D fine, or up to 6
months in prison, or both.
