##  Disorderly conduct in a public place

It is an offence to engage in offensive conduct in a public place:

  * Between the hours of midnight and 7am, or 
  * At any time, if a Garda has asked you to stop 

Offensive conduct is unreasonable behaviour which is likely to cause serious
offence or serious annoyance to other people. This public order offence aims
to deal with disorderly behaviour which falls short of threatening behaviour
but could still adversely affect the quality of people’s lives. For example,
people shouting late at night after leaving a nightclub where this would cause
serious annoyance to local residents.

The penalty for this offence is either:

  * A fixed charge fine of €140 , or 
  * The maximum class D fine if the Gardaí decide to prosecute you for the offence, and you are convicted 

You must give your name and address to the Garda, if you want this offence
treated as a fixed charge offence. If you don’t give your name and address,
you can be arrested without warrant for this and convicted of a summary
offence for which the maximum penalty is a class C fine.
