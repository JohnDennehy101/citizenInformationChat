##  Introduction

After a bereavement you may need financial support. The Department of Social
Protection (DSP) provides certain once-off payments to help out families
during this difficult time. Your [ local Community Welfare Officer
](https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/cb07d7-supplementary-welfare-allowance-swa-
list-of-offices-administering-swa/) deals with some of these payments.

You must have made a certain number of [ PRSI contributions ](/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/paying-social-
insurance/) to be eligible for some social welfare payments. You may be
eligible for other payments, if you pass a means test or if you are in urgent
need. Time limits apply for many payments, so apply as early as is possible.

You cannot be expected to do everything right away, but if the deceased was
getting a social welfare payment or you were claiming for them as a dependant
or you were getting a Carer's Allowance to look after them, it's important
that you notify the Department within the first few days of the death.

Notifying the Department does not mean the payment will be taken back
immediately. In many cases, the spouse, civil partner, cohabitant, parent or
carer may continue to receive a [ payment for 6 weeks following the death
](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/social-welfare-payments-following-
a-death/) .
