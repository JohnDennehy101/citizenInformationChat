##  What types of problems does SOLVIT helpwith?

The [ free movement ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-
union/freedom-of-movement-in-the-eu/) of people, goods, services and capital
are known as the four freedoms of the EU. If a public body in an EU country
interferes with free movement, the body may be in breach of EU law. For
example, if a business needs a special licence to operate in another EU
country, and that licence is not required by local businesses, this could be
against the principal of free movement.

SOLVIT tries to resolve disputes informally where EU rights are infringed.
This includes problems about:

  * [ Residence permission ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-eu-national/)
  * Employment rights 
  * [ Recognition of professional qualifications ](/en/returning-to-ireland/starting-work/Recognition-of-professional-qualifications-in-ireland/) : (for example, doctors, nurses or engineers) 
  * [ Social security ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/migrant-workers/eu-citizens-and-social-welfare/) and pension rights 
  * Border controls 
  * Motor vehicle registration 
  * Access to education 

Cases where SOLVIT cannot help

  * If you have taken your complaint to court 
  * [ Consumer problems ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-rights/) â€“ you should contact the European Consumer Centre instead 
  * If you are seeking compensation for damages 
  * Where a business is having problems with another business
