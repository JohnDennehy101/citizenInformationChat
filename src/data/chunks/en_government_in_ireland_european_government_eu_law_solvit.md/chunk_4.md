##  How to complain to SOLVIT

You should submit your complaint to the [ SOLVIT service online
](https://ec.europa.eu/eu-rights/enquiry-complaint-
form/home?languageCode=en&origin=solvit-web) . You should include as much
detail as possible. Your local SOLVIT Centre will contact you within 1 week.
If you have a valid cause for complaint, your local SOLVIT Centre will forward
it to the SOLVIT Centre in the other member state where the problem has
occurred.

The two SOLVIT Centres will liaise with each other during the period of
investigation and your home SOLVIT Centre will keep you informed of progress,
and the proposed solution.
