##  Check-in and boarding (flight overbooked)

If the flight is overbooked and you are told you cannot board the aircraft,
you will be entitled to compensation under EU law.

However this only applies if:

  * You have a valid ticket and you have confirmed your reservation 
  * You have presented yourself at check-in at the airport within the time specified by the airline 

You can read more about [ compensation for overbooked, cancelled and delayed
flights in the EU ](/en/travel-and-recreation/air-travel/compensation-for-
