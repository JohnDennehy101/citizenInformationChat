##  Passengers with reduced mobility

You have the right to assistance, free of charge.

This can include:

  * Help with your luggage 
  * Getting on and off the plane 
  * During the flight 
  * In airports before and after your flight 

You should contact your airline at least 48 hours before your trip and explain
what assistance you need.

Airlines and tour operators cannot refuse to carry passengers (or take
bookings), on the basis of reduced mobility. However, this only applies to
flights from airports in the EU.

Under [ Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006
](http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/transport/mobility_and_passenger_rights/l24132_en.htm)
, a reservation or boarding can only be refused for justified safety reasons.
This also includes if the boarding or transport of a person with a disability
or reduced mobility is physically impossible, either due to the size of the
aircraft or its doors. If a person is refused a reservation, an acceptable
alternative must be offered. If boarding is refused, the person must be
offered either a refund or an alternative flight. Airport authorities must
provide assistance without extra cost to the person concerned, but it may levy
a charge on all passengers.

Other provisions under this Regulation include the following:

  * On flights from EU airports, airlines must provide certain services, such as carrying wheelchairs or guide dogs, free of charge. 
  * Both airport authorities and airlines must provide training to their staff, so that those providing direct assistance to people with disabilities and reduced mobility should know how to meet their needs. All staff working at the airport should be provided with disability equality and awareness training.
