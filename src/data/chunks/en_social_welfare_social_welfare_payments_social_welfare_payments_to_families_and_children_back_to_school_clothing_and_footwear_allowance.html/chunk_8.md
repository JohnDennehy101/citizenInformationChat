###  **Calculating your total household income**

Your total household income includes:

  * Your weekly social welfare or Health Service Executive (HSE) payments, and 
  * Any other income you may have, including wages 
  * Capital (such as savings, investments, and any property you have excluding your own home) 

However, some social welfare payments are not included in the means test (see
list below).

When assessing your income from wages, the DSP looks at your income **before**
tax. However, they don’t include PRSI and a standard travel allowance of up to
€20 per week.
