##  Where can I fly my drone?

You should not fly a drone:

  * In a way that could cause a hazard to another aircraft 
  * Near moving aircraft or in an aerodrome traffic circuit 
  * In a manner that poses a risk to people, the environment or property 

Flying drones is separated into 3 categories based on the risk attached:

  * Open category 
  * Specific category 
  * Certified category 

If you are flying a drone that weighs under 25 kilograms within the limits of
the ‘open’ category you do not need a prior permission for the flight. There
are 3 subcategories in the ‘open’ category – A1, A2 and A3.

To fly a drone that weighs more than 25 kilograms, or to fly your drone
outside the ‘open’ category limits, you must apply for an [ Operational
Authorisation ](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/civil-drones-
rpas/specific-category-civil-drones/operational-authorisation) from the Irish
Aviation Authority.

Make sure to always look at the [ UAS geographical zone map
](https://www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/drones/uas-geographic-zones) before you
fly your drone. There are specific places where you are not allowed to fly
your drone, or you might need permission to fly. Some areas may have certain
restrictions or limitations on flying your drone. The [ IAA website
](https://www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/drones/faqs/geographical-zones) has more
information.

The Irish Aviation Authority or the Gardaí can take away your drone if they
believe it is likely that you will use your drone in breach of the
regulations.
