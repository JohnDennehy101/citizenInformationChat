##  Drones and data protection

If you operate a drone that has a camera or listening device which is capable
of recording images or video of persons who could be identified (with or
without zooming in), you could be a [ data controller ](/en/government-in-
ireland/data-protection/controlling-and-processing-personal-data/) under the
General Data Protection Regulations.

Any [ processing of personal data ](/en/government-in-ireland/data-
protection/controlling-and-processing-personal-data/) , including gathering,
exchanging or transmitting digital recordings must be done in accordance with
data protection law. You must have a legal basis to process that personal
data. This could be that you have:

  * The person’s consent, or 
  * A legitimate interest in processing the personal data, and there is only a minimal impact on the person’s rights. 

You may be required to prepare a [ Data Protection Impact Assessment
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/organisations/know-your-obligations/data-
protection-impact-assessments) .

You can minimise the impact on the person’s data protection rights by using
blurring software, or some other method of making the person less
identifiable.

Using a drone to take pictures or video as a recreational activity may be
exempt from data protection law, but only if you do not publish the images or
video to an unrestricted audience.

You can read more in the [ Data Protection Commission’s Guidance on the Use of
Drones
](https://www.dataprotection.ie/sites/default/files/uploads/2022-05/Guidance
on the use of drones - May 2022 Final.pdf) .
