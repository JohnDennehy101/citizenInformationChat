##  Registering as a drone operator

Drone-owners must register with the [ Irish Aviation Authority
](https://www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/drones/drone-register) to fly drones
that weigh 250 grams or more. Registration costs €30 and is valid for 2 years.
If you live in the European Union, you only need to register in the country
where you live, and not in each country where you want to fly your drone.

Even if your drone weighs less than 250 grams, you must register if it has a
camera or sensor unless it complies with the [ ‘toy’ directive
](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/faq/119218) .

To register, you must:

  * Be 16 or over 
  * Set up an account and verify your identity 
  * Take an online training course that lasts about 15 minutes 

If your drone is above 4 kilograms, or if you are planning on doing certain
activities with your drone, you must do [ extra training
](https://www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/drones/rpas-training-facilities/drone-
training---remote-pilot-competency) .

Once you are registered, you must label your drone with your drone operator
ID.
