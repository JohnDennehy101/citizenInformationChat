##  Incidents involving drones

If your drone is involved in an accident that involves serious injury or death
to a person you must inform:

  * The UAS Division of the Irish Aviation Authority 
  * The Gardaí 
  * The [ Air Accident Investigation Unit ](http://www.aaiu.ie/)

You must also inform the organisations listed above if your drone is involved
in a serious incident that could have resulted in injury or death to someone.

The Gardaí can detain the drone if they suspect there has been a breach of the
law.

A licenced [ aerodrome ](https://www.iaa.ie/general-aviation/aerodromes-5)
operator may use a counter UAS system to disable, disrupt or seize control of
an unmanned aircraft to ensure the safety of civil aviation and the public.

The Irish Aviation Authority can direct a drone operator to get insurance to
cover third parties.
