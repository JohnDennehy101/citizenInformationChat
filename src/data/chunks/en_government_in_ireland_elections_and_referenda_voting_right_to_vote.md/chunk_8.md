##  What happens if my citizenship changes?

If your citizenship changes, you should update your details on the Register of
Electors.

If you become an Irish citizen, and you are already registered to vote, you
should complete [ form ERF1 ](https://www.checktheregister.ie/en-IE/forms) to
add your new citizenship details to the Register of Electors. You will need to
supply proof that you are now an Irish citizen (either a copy of your
naturalisation certificate, or a copy of the photo page of your Irish
passport).
