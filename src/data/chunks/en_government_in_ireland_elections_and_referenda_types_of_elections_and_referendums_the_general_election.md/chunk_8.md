###  Posters and leaflets

There are rules governing posters and leaflets, and other forms of advertising
during an election campaign:

  * Posters can only be hung on poles with the permission of the pole owner 
  * Leaflets cannot be left under windscreen wipers 
  * Posters must carry the name and address of the printer 
  * Posters should not cause any disruption to road users 

Laws on election posters and leaflets do not cover:

  * Posters erected on private land (with the ownerâ€™s permission) 
  * Billboard advertisements, which come under regular planning laws 
  * Cars or trucks with election signage or pictures, so long as the signage is secured 

Local authorities have powers to remove posters where it is in the public
interest to do so.
