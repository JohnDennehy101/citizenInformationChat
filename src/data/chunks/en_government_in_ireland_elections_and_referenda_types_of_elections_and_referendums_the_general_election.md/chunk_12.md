##  Forming a government

Once all the seats have been filled, the Dáil votes on who will serve as
Taoiseach and [ lead a government ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/national-government/government-of-ireland/) . If one party has a
majority, or has the support of other parties and/or independents, it will be
clear who will lead the country into the new Dáil session.

If there is no clear majority, there may be a period of negotiation, where
groups of parties and/or independent TDs try to build a majority.

If there is no clear winner, and T.D.s are unable to decide who should form a
government, the Taoiseach (from the previous government) may have to ask the
President to dissolve the Dáil again.
