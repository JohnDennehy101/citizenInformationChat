##  What happens if I cannot attend the polling station?

Ireland only allows for postal voting in limited circumstances, and you must
be registered on either the postal voters list or the special voters list in
advance of the election.

If you cannot attend on the day of the election and do not qualify as a
special or postal voter, you will be unable to vote.
