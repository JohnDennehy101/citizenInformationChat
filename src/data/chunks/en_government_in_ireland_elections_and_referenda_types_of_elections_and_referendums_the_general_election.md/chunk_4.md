##  How often are general elections held?

A Dáil cannot continue for longer than 5 years. This is set out in the [
Electoral (Amendment) Act 1927
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1927/act/21/section/7/enacted/en/html#sec7)
.

The Taoiseach can ask the President to dissolve the Dáil at any time. The
President can only refuse to do this if the government does not have a
majority in the Dáil (a _minority government_ ).

A general election may also be called if:

  * The Taoiseach and government have lost a vote of no confidence in the Dáil. Under the [ Constitution of Ireland ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) , the Taoiseach and government must resign once a new government is formed. 
  * A _coalition partner_ (a smaller party that joins a larger party to form a government) has withdrawn its support for the government. 

In both situations, opposition parties may be able to form a government and
elect a new Taoiseach without a general election taking place.

The act of ending a Dáil is known as _dissolution_ . A general election must
be held within 30 days of the [ dissolution of the Dáil ](/en/government-in-
ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/dail-eireann/) . Once the President proclaims
that the Dáil is dissolved, the Clerk of the Dáil directs the returning
officer in each constituency to prepare for an election. The polling day is
set by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.
