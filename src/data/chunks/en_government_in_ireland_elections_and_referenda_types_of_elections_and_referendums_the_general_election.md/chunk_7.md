###  How much can candidates spend on their campaign?

The legal limit that can be spent by candidates depends on the number of seats
that are being contested in the constituency.

The maximum that a candidate can spend on a Dáil election is:

  * €45,200 per candidate in a five-seat constituency 
  * €37,650 per candidate in a four-seat constituency 
  * €30,150 per candidate in a three-seat constituency 

If a candidate receives at least one quarter of the quota of votes for the
constituency, they can claim back up to €8,700 in election expenses. You can
