####  Enduring power of attorney made before 26 April 2023

If your enduring power of attorney was made before 26 April 2023, the personal
welfare decisions to be made by the attorney must be made in your best
interests, must be in accordance with what you would have been likely to do,
and the attorney must consult family members and carers in making these
decisions. The attorney is considered to be acting in your best interests if
they reasonably believe that what they decide is in your best interests.
