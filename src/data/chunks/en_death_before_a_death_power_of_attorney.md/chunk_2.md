##  What is an enduring power of attorney?

An enduring power of attorney (EPA) is a legal device that can be set up by a
person (the donor) to allow another person (an attorney), to look after their
financial or personal affairs, in the event that they no longer have the
capacity to do so themselves.

Having an EPA is a good way of planning for the possibility that you may not
be able to make certain decisions for yourself at some stage. A person can
lose their decision-making abilities at any age. An enduring power of attorney
is just one of the [ legal arrangements you can make in the event you become
incapacitated ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/assisted-decision-making-
act/) or unable to deal with your affairs.

EPAs do not cover decisions about medical treatment. You can make an [ Advance
Healthcare Directive ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/legal-
matters-and-health/advance-care-directives/) if you want to make decisions
about the medical treatment you get in the event that you lose your capacity.

**EPA made on or after 26 April 2023**

An EPA that was made on or after 26 April 2023 only takes effect when each of
the following has occurred:

  * The EPA has been registered with the [ Decision Support Service ](https://www.decisionsupportservice.ie/)
  * The donor lacks decision-making capacity 
  * The Decision Support Service has been notified of the incapacity and it accepts the fact 

**EPA made before 26 April 2023**

An EPA made before 26 April 2023 only takes effect if registered with the [
Office of the Ward of Courts
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/wards-
of-court/) . An attorney can register the EPA when the donor becomes incapable
of managing their affairs.
