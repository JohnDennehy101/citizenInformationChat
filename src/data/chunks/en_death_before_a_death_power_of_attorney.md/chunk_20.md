###  Termination of an enduring power of attorney

An EPA ceases on the death of the donor.

However, there are other circumstances in which an attorney can become
disqualified. For example, where a spouse or civil partner is the attorney,
the attorney becomes disqualified, unless the EPA provides otherwise, where:

  * The marriage or civil partnership no longer exists due to annulment, divorce or dissolution 
  * A judicial separation is granted or the couple enter into a separation agreement 

An attorney will also be disqualified in other circumstances, including if:

  * The attorney is convicted of an offence against you, your property or your child or their property 
  * A protection or barring order is made against the attorney in relation to the donor or the donorâ€™s child 
  * The attorney is a dissolved trust corporation 

When an EPA has been registered and a notification of lack of capacity has
been accepted by the DSS, an attorney must apply to court for consent to
resign.
