##  Creating an enduring power of attorney

Because the enduring power of attorney (EPA) involves the transfer of
considerable powers from you to another person, there are a number of legal
safeguards to protect you from abuses.

The procedure for executing the EPA is complex and you have to use a solicitor
and a doctor or healthcare professional. The enduring power can only come into
effect when certain procedures have been gone through.

The document creating the EPA must be in a particular format and must include
the following:

  * A statement from you that you understood the effect of creating the power 
  * A statement by a doctor or healthcare professional verifying that in their opinion you had the capacity at the time that the document was executed to understand the effect of creating the power 
  * A statement from a [ solicitor ](/en/justice/courtroom/solicitors/) or [ barrister ](/en/justice/courtroom/barristers/) that they are satisfied that you understood the effect of creating the power of attorney 
  * A statement from a solicitor or barrister that you were not acting under undue influence 
  * A statement by the chosen attorney or attorneys that they understand their obligations and agree to be an attorney 

The making of the EPA must be witnessed by 2 people.
