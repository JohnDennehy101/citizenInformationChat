###  Rescinding an EPA if you regain your capacity

Once a notification of lack of capacity has been accepted by the Decision
Support Service, the effect of an EPA can be rescinded if you regain your
decision making capacity. In this case, you (or the attorney, or a close
family member acting on your behalf) can write to the Decision Support
Service. This will have the effect of cancelling the EPA.

Your application for the EPA to be rescinded must include:

  * A statement that you understand the implications of your request 
  * A statement by a solicitor that you understand the implications of your request, and that they are satisfied that you are not acting under any pressure from another person 
  * A statement by 2 people who are doctors or healthcare professionals that you no longer lack capacity in relation to the relevant decisions set out in the EPA 

For EPAs created before the 26 April 2023, you must apply to the High Court to
revoke the power.
