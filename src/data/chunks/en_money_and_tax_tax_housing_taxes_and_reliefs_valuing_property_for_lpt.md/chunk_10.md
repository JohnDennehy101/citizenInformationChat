###  Self-contained units and bedsits

If part of a building is used as a dwelling, or is suitable for use as a
dwelling, it is generally treated as a separate residential property. For
example, a self-contained ‘granny flat’ that adjoins the main property is
liable for LPT.

However, where the 'granny flat' and the adjoining property is owned by the
same person, it may be possible to value them as a single property. If you
wish to do this, you should submit details of the layout of the property and
its ownership to [ Revenue LPT Branch ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/contact-
us/customer-service-contact/lpt-vht.aspx) for approval.

If a building contains units that are not suitable for use as self-contained
dwellings, such as a bedsit, the building as a whole should be valued for LPT
purposes in the same LPT Return.
