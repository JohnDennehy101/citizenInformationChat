##  Introduction

If you are the owner of a residential property on 1 November, you have to pay
[ Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-
property-tax/) (LPT).

The tax is based on the value of your property. The value of your property on
1 November 2021 is used to decide how much LPT you pay each year for the years
2022 to 2025.

If you have a property that is newly built or renovated, you should [ assess
the value it would have had on 1 November 2021
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/valuing-your-
property/newly-liable-properties.aspx) if it had been completed then.

You must tell Revenue what the market value of your property is. Revenue
provides guidance on how you can assess the value of your property and also
has an online valuation tool you can use.

If you have a [ property that is exempt from LPT ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax-exemptions/) , you must
still value your property and submit your Local Property Tax return to claim
an exemption.

If you have submitted your return, you can [ correct your property valuation
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/submitting-your-local-
property-tax-return/correct-lpt-return.aspx) if the value you assessed was too
high or too low.
