##  Properties adapted for a person with a disability

If your property has been adapted to make it more suitable for a person with
disability, you may be eligible to reduce the property valuation. If you are
eligible for this relief, you can reduce your valuation by â‚¬87,500, which is
the width of most the LPT valuation bands. This will move your valuation into
a lower valuation band and reduce your LPT Charge.

You are eligible for this relief if:

  * You adapt your property to make it suitable for a person with a disability and 
  * The value of your property is increased because of the adaptation work and 
  * A person with a disability lives in your property and it is their sole or main residence and 
  * You get a local authority grant towards the cost of the adaption work or you got approval from Revenue for the relief 

The person with a disability who lives in the adapted property does not have
to be the owner of the property.

To claim relief for an adapted property, you should complete [ Form LPT6A
(pdf) ](https://revenue.ie/en/property/documents/lpt/form-lpt6a.pdf) and
submit it to Revenue.
