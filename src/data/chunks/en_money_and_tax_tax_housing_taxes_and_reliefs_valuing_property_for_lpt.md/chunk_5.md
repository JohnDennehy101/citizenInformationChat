###  Residential Property Price Register

You can use the [ Residential Property Price Register
](https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/website/npsra/pprweb.nsf/PPR?OpenForm)
to see the price of properties that have been sold in your area. You can see
the sale price of properties that are a similar type, age and size to yours.
You should use a number of relevant sales to help you make your valuation. To
get the value for new properties sold, you have to add 13.5% VAT to the sales
price shown on the register.
