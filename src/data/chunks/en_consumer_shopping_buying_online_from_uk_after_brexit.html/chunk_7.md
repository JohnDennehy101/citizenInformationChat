##  If things go wrong

When you buy online, you have [ additional protections under EU law if things
go wrong ](/en/consumer/consumer-laws/your-consumer-rights/) . These rights do
not apply if you buy from a trader based outside the EU.

From 1 January 2021, you should be especially careful when buying from a UK
seller. It is very important to carefully check the terms and conditions on
the sellerâ€™s website.

You should be aware that:

  * Your 14-day cancellation period under EU law may no longer apply if you try to cancel your order after 31 December 2020. However, UK law may set down similar rights. A business based in the UK may still accept a return under its general terms and conditions. 
  * If the product becomes faulty after 31 December 2020 you may not be able to [ use the European Small Claims procedure ](/en/consumer/how-to-complain/how-to-make-a-complaint#l54118) . You can still complain to the business directly.
