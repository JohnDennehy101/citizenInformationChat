###  How you will pay VAT and customs charges

There are two ways VAT and customs charges are applied to eligible purchases
from the UK:

  1. The business can register with Revenue and collect Irish VAT and any duties payable **when you are making your purchase online** . You should not have to pay any UK VAT on your purchase. You will not have to pay further Revenue charges on delivery. 
  2. If the business is not registered with Revenue, then **your package may be subject to VAT and other charges on arrival into Ireland from the UK** . The postal service or courier company delivering the package will complete the relevant customs declarations, including where the product is manufactured. You will get a bill from the courier or postal company before your package is delivered. The company usually have an administration charge. Charges vary and there may be a minimum charge (between €10 to €15).
