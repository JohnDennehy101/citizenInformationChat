##  Introduction

The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020. The transition period that
was in place ended on 31 December 2020.

As a result of Brexit, there are changes to your consumer rights when buying
online from businesses in the UK. This is the case even though the EU and UK
have agreed a [ Trade and Cooperation Agreement
](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/relations-non-eu-
countries/relations-united-kingdom/eu-uk-trade-and-cooperation-agreement_en) .

From 1 January 2021, you should be aware of the following changes:

  * Additional import charges and Value Added Tax (VAT) apply when you buy from websites in the UK (depending on the value of the items and where the product is manufactured) 
  * EU consumer protection legislation may no longer apply, instead your consumer rights will be set down in UK law 
  * It may be more difficult to resolve a dispute with a UK business
