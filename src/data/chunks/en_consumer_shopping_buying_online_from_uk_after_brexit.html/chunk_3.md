##  Shopping online from a UK business

When you buy online, you have [ additional protections under EU law

apply if you buy from a trader based outside the EU.

from UK retailers. However, these rights will be set down in UK law and not EU
law. The legal guarantees you have under EU law may no longer apply.

Before you buy, check if the business has included any Irish VAT or customs
charges in the final price. If not, then you may have to cover the costs on
delivery of your items – see ‘Taxes and other charges’.

checklist.pdf) of things to note when shopping online.
