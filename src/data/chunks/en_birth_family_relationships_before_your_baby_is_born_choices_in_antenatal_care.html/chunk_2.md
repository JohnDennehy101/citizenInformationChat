##  Introduction

Antenatal care is the care you receive during your pregnancy from healthcare
professionals (before your baby is born).

It is sometimes called maternity care or pregnancy care. [ Postnatal care
](/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/postnatal-care/) is
the care you and your baby receive after the birth.

There are 3 different types of antenatal care in Ireland:

  * Public care 
  * Semi-private care (this is only available in Dublin maternity hospitals) 
  * Private care 

If you think you are pregnant, the first step is to visit your GP or contact
your local maternity unit or hospital. They will confirm your pregnancy with a
[ pregnancy test ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/pregnancy-
tests.html) and discuss your antenatal care options.
