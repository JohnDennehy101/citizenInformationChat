##  Public care

You can get free public maternity care through the [ Maternity and Infant Care
Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-
services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-services/) .

The number of appointments you have will depend on your needs, the needs of
the baby, and any potential risk of complications.

If your pregnancy is uncomplicated or ‘normal’, you can have your baby in a
hospital or [ at home ](/en/birth-family-relationships/before-your-baby-is-
born/home-birth/) . Your antenatal care will be provided by midwives (as well
as your GP if you have chosen shared care). In many hospitals, you will not
see a doctor unless there are complications. Your labour and delivery will be
attended by the midwives, and if needed, the hospital doctors on duty at the
time.

After the birth, you will be moved to the public ward for the rest of your
stay. This is generally for about 3 days, though some hospitals will allow you
to go home early with follow-up care. For example, a 'Domino' scheme is
available in some hospitals for women with normal risk pregnancies. The Domino
scheme means your care will be provided by a team of midwives during
pregnancy, labour and birth. After you leave the hospital, a midwife will
visit you in your home.

If you have a ‘medium risk’ or ‘higher risk’ pregnancy, your antenatal care
will be provided by an obstetrician (a doctor who specialises in pregnancy,
labour and birth) and a team of midwives. The birth will take place in a
hospital setting, rather than at home. You will also have appointments with
your GP if you have chosen shared or combined care.
