###  Carbon tax

**Carbon tax** will increase by €7.50 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted,
from €41.00 to €48.50. This applies from 12 October 2022 for auto fuels but
will be offset by a levy reduction so that it will not result in a price
increase.

The carbon tax increase will apply to all other fuels (including household
fuels) from 1 May 2023.

The tables below show the estimated price increases on commonly-used household
fuels:
