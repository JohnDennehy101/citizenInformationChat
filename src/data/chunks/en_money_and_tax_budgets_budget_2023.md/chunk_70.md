####  Carbon tax

**Carbon tax** will increase by €7.50 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted,
from €41.00 to €48.50. This applies from 12 October 2022 for auto fuels but
will be offset by a levy reduction so that it will not result in a price
increase. For all other fuels, the carbon tax will increase from 1 May 2023.
