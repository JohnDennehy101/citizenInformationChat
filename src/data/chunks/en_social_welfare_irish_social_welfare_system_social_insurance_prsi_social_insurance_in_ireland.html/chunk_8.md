##  Unearned income and social insurance

Unearned income from rents, investments, dividends and interest on deposits
and savings is liable to PRSI at 4% since 1 January 2014. People aged under 16
and over 70 are exempt from PRSI and are not liable for the new charge. (In
2013 people paying modified rate contributions (mainly civil and public
servants recruited before April 1995) became liable to PRSI of 4% (paid at
Class K) on earned self-employed income and any unearned income (from 1
January 2013) and on self-employed income which comes under PAYE (from 28 June
2013).

Anyone with unearned income of over €5,000 is considered to be a 'chargeable
person' and is liable to pay the PRSI charge at 4% on all their unearned
income. They pay the charge under Revenue's self-assessment system (Pay and
File). The new PRSI charge is paid at Class K and does not entitle the person
to any social insurance benefits.

PAYE tax payers who are not considered 'chargeable persons' by Revenue are not
liable for the new PRSI charge. A person is not a 'chargeable person' if their
income from non-PAYE sources is less than €5,000 and this income is taxed
under the PAYE system. (Generally such income is taxed by reducing a person’s
tax credits to account for tax payable. However if you have paid [ Deposit
Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/tax-on-savings-and-
investments/deposit-interest-retention-tax/) on your non-PAYE income you are
not required to pay further income tax on this income.)
