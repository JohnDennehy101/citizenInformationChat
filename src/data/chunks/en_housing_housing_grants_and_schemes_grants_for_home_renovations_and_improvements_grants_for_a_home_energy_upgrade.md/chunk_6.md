##  How much are the grants?

The table below shows the grant amount available for each energy upgrade. The
grant amounts for approved housing bodies (AHBs) are different to those for
homeowners and landlords. The amount you get for each upgrade can also depend
on the type of property you have. For example, the grant you get to insulate a
detached house is more than the grant you get to insulate an apartment.

The One-Stop-Shop will assess your home and recommend the work needed to get
your home up to a BER B2 rating.
