##  Introduction

The National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme provides grants to upgrade the energy
efficiency of your property. When the work is completed your property should
have an energy efficiency rating of B2 or above. The scheme is available to
homeowners, private landlords and [ approved housing bodies
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) .

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers the grants and
a private company manages the work for you. These companies are called [ One
Stop Shops ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/one-stop-
shop/registered-providers/) , and the scheme is also known as the [ One Stop
Shop Service ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/one-stop-shop/) .

The SEAI also provides [ individual energy upgrade grants
](/en/housing/housing-grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-
improvements/better-energy-homes-scheme/) , if you only want to do certain
home energy upgrades.

You may be able to get a [ Home Energy Upgrade Loan ](/en/housing/housing-
grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/home-energy-
upgrade-loan-scheme/) to help with the additional costs of the upgrades that
arenâ€™t covered by the grant. These loans are subsidised by the Government so
have lower interest rates than normal personal loans. You only qualify for the
loan if you are getting a [ home energy upgrade grant
](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/home-energy-upgrade-loan/)
from the SEAI.

There is also a [ free home energy upgrade scheme ](/en/housing/housing-
grants-and-schemes/grants-for-home-renovations-and-improvements/warmer-homes-
scheme/) for people on low incomes.
