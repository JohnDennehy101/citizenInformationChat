###  Registration of marriages abroad

Marriages of Irish citizens abroad are registered in the country where they
occur. The Irish [ General Register Office
](https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/af7893-general-register-office/) has no role
in advising on or the registering of marriages of Irish citizens that take
place abroad.

Marriages that take place outside the State are not normally registered in
Ireland.

**Note:** A church marriage abroad is often a purely religious ceremony with
no legal effect. As it is not recognised in law, it cannot be recognised as a
legal marriage when you return to Ireland. This is the case even though a
marriage in the same denomination in Ireland can be legally binding.

Your marriage will only be recognised in Ireland if:

  * It is entered on the civil register of the country where the wedding took place 
  * All legal formalities have been followed
