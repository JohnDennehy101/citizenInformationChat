##  Introduction

If either you or your partner is an Irish citizen and you plan to get married
abroad, you will need to meet certain legal requirements to ensure your
marriage is _legally valid_ (legally recognised) when you return to Ireland.
You may also need to bring certain documentation with you.

When you get married abroad, you must meet all the legal requirements of the
country you are marrying in. These legal formalities are usually different to
those in Ireland.

Whether you are an Irish citizen, an EU/EEA citizen, or a foreign national,
you should contact the civil registration office **in the country you are
marrying in** to find out exactly what document you require. Ireland’s General
Register Office has no involvement in marriages abroad. Read ‘ _Ensuring your
marriage is recognised in Ireland_ ’ below.
