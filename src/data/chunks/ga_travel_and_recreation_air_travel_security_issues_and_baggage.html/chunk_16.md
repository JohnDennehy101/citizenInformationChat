###  Restricted items with special precautions

Your airline may carry some items of baggage with special precautions. There
may be an additional charge to carry these items and it is always advisable to
check with the airline in advance regarding special arrangements. For example,
the following may be considered restricted items:

  * Sports equipment (for example, golf clubs, surfboards, snowboards, skis, and bicycles) are allowed as checked baggage only. 
  * Mobility aids (such as electric wheelchairs and walking frames). 
  * Musical instruments. 
  * Guide dogs (some airlines will allow visually impaired passengers to travel with their guide dog once the animal is securely fastened and complies with quarantine requirements at your destination).
