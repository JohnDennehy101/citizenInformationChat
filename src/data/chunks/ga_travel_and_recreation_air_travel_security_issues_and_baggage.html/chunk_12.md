##  Planning and packing your luggage

  * Ensure your bag is securely closed and locked if possible. 
  * Tie up loose straps and ensure no items are hanging from the bag - they may get caught in the baggage system. 
  * Do not pack medication, important documents, valuable items, or cash in your checked luggage - carry them in your unchecked hand luggage. 
  * You should label each bag on the inside with your name and full destination address and on the outside with your name and destination city. 
  * Airlines can set their own limits for the weight and dimensions (width, length, and depth) of checked and unchecked hand luggage. You may have to pay additional charges if your luggage exceeds these limits. You can check the limits with the customer service department of the airline in advance of travel.
