###  **Can I burn wood in my garden?**

It is illegal to burn any waste in your garden, including wood. Many wood
products are treated with toxic chemicals to prevent them from rotting.
Burning them can release harmful chemicals into the atmosphere and damage the
environment.

You can get rid of wood at a [ civic amenity site
](https://www.mywaste.ie/waste-service-locator/) .
