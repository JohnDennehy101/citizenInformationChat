###  Monitoring compliance and enforcement

ComReg has a role as the regulator to:

  * Make sure providers follow the rules through enforcement 
  * Investigate complaints received from the wider industry and consumers 
  * Prevent fraud and misuse of Irish numbers to protect both end-users and operators 
  * Make sure network incidents (breach of security or loss of integrity that has a significant impact on the operation of networks and services) are properly managed by network operators. ComReg must be told about network incidents.
