###  Handles complaints

You should be treated fairly and get the service that you pay for and is
stated in your contract. ComReg has a Consumer Care Team who can help you with
queries about service or contract issues. They can also help you fix a problem
with a service provider.

Electronic Communication Services (ECS) providers must have a code of practice
in place for handling complaints. Your service provider must:

  * Make it easy for you to make a complaint 
  * Not transfer you to another section of the business if the call will cost more than the call to a landline or mobile number 
  * Acknowledge your complaint within 2 working days and give details of the link to the code of practice and a unique reference number so you can track your complaint 
  * Respond to and try to resolve your complaint within 10 working days and if this is not possible, you must be told about the escalation process 
  * Record and track your complaint
