###  Basic telecommunication services

You are entitled to affordable quality basic communications, including
connection for a phone line and internet access at a fixed location.

There should be at least one telecoms provider who can provide this service
for you. This is known as the principle of Universal Service.

The universal service provider is Eir (previously known as Telecom Ã‰ireann).

You can find out more about the Universal Service Obligation on [ ComRegs

The rules are set out in the [ Universal Service Directive ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32002L0022&from=EN) , which
was brought into law in Ireland by the [ European Communities (Electronic
Communications Networks and Services) (Universal Service and Users' Rights)
Regulations 2011
