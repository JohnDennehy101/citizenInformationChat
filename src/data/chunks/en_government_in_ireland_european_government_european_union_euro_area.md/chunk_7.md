##  The European Stability Mechanism

The [ European Stability Mechanism (ESM) ](https://www.esm.europa.eu/)
provides assistance to countries in the euro area that are having severe
financial problems. It gives assistance if the financial problems of the
country concerned threaten to damage the financial stability of the euro area
as a whole.

Countries can only receive help from the ESM if they have ratified the [
Fiscal Stability Treaty
](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/mb201203_focus12.en.pdf) .

Ireland received financial assistance from the EU and others in 2010. This was
referred to as ‘the bailout’, EU financial assistance was provided by the
European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the European Financial
Stability Mechanism (EFSM). The ETSF has been replaced by the ESM.
