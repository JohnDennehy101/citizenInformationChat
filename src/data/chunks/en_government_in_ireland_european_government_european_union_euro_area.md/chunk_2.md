##  Introduction

Nineteen [ European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/european-union/european-union/) member states are part of the euro

They are:

**Countries that use the euro** Austria  |  Germany  |  Luxemburg

Belgium  |  Greece  |  Malta

Estonia  |  Latvia  |  Slovakia   
Finland  |  Lithuania  |  Slovenia

Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City also use the euro as their
national currency, although these small countries are not part of the EU or
euro area.

The euro currency was physically launched in 2002, but the idea of the
monetary union of the member states of the EU was agreed earlier in the [
Treaty of Maastricht ](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/in-
the-past/the-parliament-and-the-treaties/maastricht-treaty) in 1992.

This document explains how the euro area works, the role of the [ European
Central Bank ](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) and the
other mechanisms that are in place to protect the currency.
