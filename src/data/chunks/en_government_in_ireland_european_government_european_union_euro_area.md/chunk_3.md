##  Economic and Monetary Union

The Maastricht Treaty set the EU on the path to a single currency when it
enshrined the [ Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)
](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-
coordination/economic-and-monetary-union/what-economic-and-monetary-union-
emu_en) .

EMU applies to all member states of the EU, including the countries that are
not part of the euro area. This means that monetary policy in the EU is co-
ordinated. EU countries decide their own economic policies and set their own
budgets, but they must follow the rules set out in the Stability and Growth
Pact.

In the euro area, monetary policy is managed by the European Central Bank
(ECB). The ECB is independent of the EU. For the countries outside the euro
area, monetary policy is co-ordinated by the ECB through the central banks of
each member state.
