###  Your home

Your home will be removed from your financial assessment after you have been
in care for 3 years. You do not need to do anything.

If you sell your home while you are in care, the net proceeds of sale will
also qualify for the 3-year cap. You need to [ contact your local nursing
homes support scheme office ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/fair-deal-
scheme/contact-a-nursing-homes-support-office.html) if you sell your home.
