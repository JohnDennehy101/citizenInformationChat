###  When the assessments are complete

When the Care Needs and Financial Assessments have been completed, the HSE
will write to you about:

  * What you need to pay as your contribution to care 
  * Whether you qualify for State support and the Nursing Home Loan 
  * What nursing homes are part of the scheme 

You may choose any nursing home that is part of Fair Deal as along as:

  * The home has a place for you. 
  * The home can cater for your needs. The nursing home will have to carry out an assessment to decide if it can meet your needs. 

Your payment will be the same for voluntary, private or a public nursing home.

You can request another financial review 12 months after your first assessment
or your last review. However, the HSE may review a financial assessment at any
stage.
