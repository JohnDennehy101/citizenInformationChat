###  **How does the Fair Deal scheme work?**

When you apply, your care needs are assessed by the HSE to confirm that long-
term nursing home care is the most appropriate option for you.

The HSE also assesses your financial situation to see how much you can afford
to pay towards your nursing home care. The HSE then pays the balance between
what you can pay for your care and what the nursing home charges for providing
that care. Your assets, such as savings and property, are taken into account
when assessing your financial situation.
