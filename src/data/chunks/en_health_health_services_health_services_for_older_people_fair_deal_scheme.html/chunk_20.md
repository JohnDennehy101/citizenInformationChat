###  3-year cap

Some assets are only included in the financial assessment for the first 3
years you are in care. This is known as the ‘ [ 3-year cap
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/fair-deal-scheme/the-3-year-cap.html) '. It
means that you pay a 7.5% contribution based on the value of certain assets
for up to 3 years.

These assets can include:

  * Your home 
  * The proceeds of the sale of your home 
  * Your farm or business 

After 3 years, you will not give any further payment based on these assets,
even if you are still getting long-term nursing home care. The ‘3-year cap’
applies whether you choose to get the Nursing Home Loan or not.

All other assets will be taken into account for as long as you are in care.

If you have already been in a nursing home for 3 years when you apply for the
scheme, then you do not pay the 7.5% on your home.
