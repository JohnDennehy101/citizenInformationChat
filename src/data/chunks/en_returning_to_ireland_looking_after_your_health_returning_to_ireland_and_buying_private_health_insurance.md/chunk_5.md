##  How long do I have to wait to be covered?

When you take out health insurance for the first time in Ireland, you may have
to serve [ waiting periods ](https://www.hia.ie/consumer-information/waiting-
periods) before you are fully covered. However, some insurers will remove the
waiting period when you return if you have previously had health insurance in
Ireland or if you were covered by certain types of health insurance abroad.

There is no waiting period for accidents and injuries so they will be covered
immediately.

The maximum initial waiting period is 26 weeks for illnesses that start after
you join. For maternity claims, the waiting period is 52 weeks.

If you have a [ pre-existing condition ](https://www.hia.ie/consumer-
information/faq#:~:text=%22'Pre%2Dexisting%20condition',became%20insured%20under%20the%20contract.%E2%80%9D)
(an illness that existed in the 6 months before buying health insurance), the
maximum waiting period is 5 years before that condition will be covered by
your insurance.

If you need healthcare during your waiting period, you can still use public
healthcare services or pay in full for private healthcare services.
