###  Step 2: Your application is matched with a child

Your application is matched with a child in the child’s country of origin.

When a match is made, the Central Authority (or an accredited body) in the
child’s country of origin sends a ‘child-study report’ (also known as _an
Article 16 report_ ) to the Adoption Authority (or the Irish-based accredited
body).

The report will normally contain:

  * A background report on the child 
  * The birth-parents (if known) 
  * Medical history of the child 
  * Proof that consent, where applicable, was obtained in the required manner and format. 

If the Adoption Authority is satisfied with the suitability of the match, it
gives its consent to the placement of the child with you (known as _Article
17_ ).
