##  Who can adopt?

You must be at least 21 years of age to adopt a child under Irish law. There
is no Irish legal upper age limit for adopting parents but age is a factor in
determining suitability here.

You must also:

  * Have a valid 'declaration of eligibility and suitability' (see 'Being assessed for eligibility to adopt' below) 
  * Be ‘habitually resident in the State’, which means Ireland has become your home. Living in Ireland for at least one year before the date of the making of the adoption order would generally be sufficient. 

Your relationship status does not necessarily impact your eligibility to adopt
a child. This means you are eligible to adopt if you are:

  * A married couple 
  * A couple living together in a civil partnership 
  * A couple _cohabiting_ together in a relationship for at least 3 years (living together but not married or in a civil partnership) 
  * A sole applicant who is not in one of the categories listed above (only where the Adoption Authority is satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is desirable and in the best interests of the child) 

You may also be eligible to adopt if you are the mother, father or _relative_
of the child. ‘Relative’ means a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt
of the child (or the spouse of any such person), with the relationship to the
child being traced through either the mother or the father.

This is set out in [ the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017 (pdf)
