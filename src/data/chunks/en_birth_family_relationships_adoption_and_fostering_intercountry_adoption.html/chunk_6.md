##  Choosing a country to adopt from

As part of the assessment process, you will decide on a country from which you
want to adopt a child.

Irish residents can only adopt from countries that:

  * Have ratified the [ Hague Convention ](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&cid=69)
  * Have not ratified the Hague Convention but have a ‘bilateral agreement’ with Ireland (Ireland does not currently have any such agreements). 

This means that, at present, you can only adopt from the following countries:

  * Bulgaria 
  * China 
  * Haiti 
  * India 
  * Philippines 
  * Poland 
  * Thailand 
  * United Kingdom 
  * United States of America 
  * Vietnam 

Each country has its own requirements and restrictions in relation to
prospective adopters. You can [ get specific information about each country’s
requirements ](https://aai.gov.ie/en/who-we-are/inter-country/country-
information.html) from the accredited Irish agencies who carry out adoptions
from these countries.
