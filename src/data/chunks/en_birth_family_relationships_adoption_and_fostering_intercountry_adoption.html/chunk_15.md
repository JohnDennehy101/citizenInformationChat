###  Register the adoption in Ireland

If the child was adopted in the country of origin, the final step in the
intercountry adoption process is the registration of the adoption. This is the
formal, legal recognition of the adoption by the Irish State.

to the Adoption Authority **within 3 months** of re-entering Ireland following
the adoption.

The Adoption Authority can register the adoption in the ‘Register of
Intercountry Adoptions’, on the basis of an ‘Article 23 certificate’. An
_Article 23 certificate_ is a certificate of assurance from the child’s
country of origin that proves the adoption was carried out in compliance with
the Hague Convention.
