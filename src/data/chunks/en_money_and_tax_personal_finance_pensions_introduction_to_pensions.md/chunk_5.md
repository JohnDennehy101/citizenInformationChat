##  Link with social welfare pensions

Occupational and personal pensions are independent of the social welfare
pension system (which includes a [ contributory State Pension ](/en/social-
welfare/older-and-retired-people/state-pension-contributory/) and a [ non-
contributory State Pension ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-
people/state-pension-non-contributory/) ).

However, it is common for occupational pensions to take into account the
amount of the social welfare when calculating the level of benefit. For
example, some schemes provide for a benefit which, taken together with the
social welfare pension, will give you a half or two-thirds of your final
salary. These schemes are sometimes called integrated or co-ordinated schemes.
