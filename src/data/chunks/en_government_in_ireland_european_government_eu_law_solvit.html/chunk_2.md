##  Introduction

As a citizen of the [ European Union (EU) ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/european-union/european-union/) you have the right
to move freely within the EU and the EEA. The EEA is the EU plus Iceland,
Norway and Lichtenstein. If you are an EU citizen living in another country in
the EU, you have [ certain rights under EU law ](/en/government-in-
ireland/european-government/european-union/freedom-of-movement-in-the-eu/) .

[ SOLVIT ](http://ec.europa.eu/solvit/site/index_en.htm) is a free service
that can help EU citizens and businesses who are facing obstacles to having
their EU rights recognised by public authorities in another country in the EU.

SOLVIT works as part of the national Government of each member state, so there
is a [ network of SOLVIT centres
](http://ec.europa.eu/solvit/contact/index_en.htm) across the EU.
