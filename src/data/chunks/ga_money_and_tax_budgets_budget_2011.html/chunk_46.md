###  Retirement lump sums

The overall life-time limit on the amount of tax-free retirement lump sums
that an individual can draw down from pension arrangements is being reduced to
€200,000. Lump sums over €200,000 will be taxed at the standard income tax
rate (currently 20%) up to €575,000 (25% of the new Standard Fund Threshold).
Anything over this amount will be taxed at the taxpayer’s marginal rate of
income tax.

Tax-free retirement lump sums taken on or after 7 December 2005 will count
towards “using up” the new tax free amount so that if a person has already
taken tax free retirement lump sums of €200,000 or more since 7 December 2005,
any further retirement lump sums paid to them on or after 1 January 2011 will
be taxable. These earlier lump sums will also count towards determining how
much of a lump sum paid on or after Budget day is to be charged at the
standard or marginal tax rate. This change will apply with effect from 1
January 2011.
