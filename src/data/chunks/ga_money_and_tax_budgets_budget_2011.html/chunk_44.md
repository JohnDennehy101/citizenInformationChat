###  Maximum allowable pension funds

The maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes (known as
the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT)), is to be set at €2.3 million with effect
from 7 December 2010. A higher threshold may apply if, on 7 December 2010, the
capital value of an individual’s pension rights drawn down on or after 7
December 2005 (i.e. crystallised pension rights) when added to any
uncrystallised pension rights the individual may have, as valued on 7 December
2010, are greater than €2.3 million and lower than €5,418,085 which is the
current value of the SFT. This change will apply with effect from 1 January
2011\.
