###  Stamp duty

The rate of stamp duty for transfers of residential property will reduce to 1%
on properties valued up to €1 million. A rate of 2% will apply to amounts over
€1 million. The new rates will apply to property transfers on or after 8
December 2010.

All existing reliefs and exemptions for stamp duty on residential property are
being abolished in respect of instruments executed on or after 8 December
2010, as follows:

  * First-time buyer relief 
  * Exemption for new houses under 125 sq m in size 
  * Relief on new houses over 125 sq m in size 
  * Consanguinity relief for residential property transfers 
  * Exemption for residential property transfers valued under €127,000 
  * Site to child relief 

A transitional provision will be put in place to ensure that anyone who has
entered into a binding contract to purchase a residential property before 8
December 2010, and who executes the transfer of that property before 1 July
2011, will not lose out.
