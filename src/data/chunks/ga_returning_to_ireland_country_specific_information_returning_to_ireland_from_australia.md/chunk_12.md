###  **PPS numbers**

When you return to Ireland, you will need a [ Personal Public Service (PPS)
number ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) to access social welfare
benefits and many public services. A PPS number (sometimes called a ‘PPSN’) is
always 7 numbers followed by either one or 2 letters.

You already have a PPS number if you:

  * Were born in Ireland from 1971 onwards 
  * Started work in Ireland after 1979 
  * Are getting an Irish social welfare payment 

If you have never had one before, see which [ documents you’ll need to apply
for a PPS number ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-
ireland/applying-for-social-welfare/pps-numbers-for-returning-irish-emigrants-
and-families/#e98839) .
