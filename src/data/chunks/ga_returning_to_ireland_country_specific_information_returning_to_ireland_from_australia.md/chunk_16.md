##  Exchanging your driver’s licence

If you have an Australian driving licence, you can exchange it for an Irish
licence. To exchange the licence, you can:

  * [ Apply online ](https://www.ndls.ie/licensed-driver/exchange-my-foreign-driving-licence.html#to-apply-online-to-exchange-a-foreign-driving-licence-issued-by-a-recognised-state)
  * [ Apply in-person at a National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) centre ](https://www.ndls.ie/how-to-apply/applying-in-person.html#evidence-of-normal-residence)

All Australian licence exchange applications need to include a Letter of
Entitlement (sometimes called a ‘driver’s statement’). This Letter of
Entitlement is a record of your driving history. You can get this from the
road traffic authority of the State or Territory that issued your licence.

You can find a [ contact list for each driver licensing authority in Australia
](https://ireland.embassy.gov.au/dubl/DrivingLicenceInformation.html) on the
embassy website.

If you are exchanging an Australian licence from the following territories,
you will be restricted to driving automatic vehicles:

  * Australian Capital Territory 
  * New South Wales 
  * Northern Territory 
  * South Australia 
  * Tasmania 
  * Victoria (see below) 

Make sure that the Letter of Entitlement submitted in support of your
application indicates whether you took your driving test in a vehicle with
manual or automatic transmission. If your driving test was taken in an
automatic vehicle, you can only drive an automatic vehicle.

If the road traffic authority that issued your licence can provide
confirmation that you completed your test on a vehicle with manual
transmission, you will not be restricted to driving only automatic vehicles.
