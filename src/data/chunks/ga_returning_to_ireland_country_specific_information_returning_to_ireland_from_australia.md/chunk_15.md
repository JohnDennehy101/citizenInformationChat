###  **Australian social security payments in Ireland**

Ireland has a social security agreement with Australia that allows people to
move between the countries and protect their pension entitlements.

Where a person has worked in both Ireland and Australia, the rate of pension
is determined on a pro-rata basis. This means that each country pays a partial
pension, based on a formula that uses the contribution record from both
countries.

social-security-agreements/current-international-social-security-
agreements/australia-and-ireland-frequently-asked-questions) on the Australian
Department of Social Services website.

If you are receiving an Australian pension and return to Ireland, Services
Australia will pay it into your nominated Irish bank account every 4 weeks.
Payments to customers in Ireland are in Euros. Claims and questions about the
Agreement are handled by [ Centrelink International Services
