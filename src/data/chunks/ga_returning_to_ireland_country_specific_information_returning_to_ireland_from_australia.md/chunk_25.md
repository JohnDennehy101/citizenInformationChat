####  **Find out what you can afford**

Review your budget and find out how much you can afford in monthly mortgage
repayments. You should ensure that you have enough to cover all the [ costs
involved in buying a home
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-
home/costs-of-buying-a-home/) , for example, mortgage costs, legal fees,
insurance, and stamp duty.

The amount of money you can get as a mortgage loan, and the amount you need as
a deposit, are governed by Central Bank lending limits â€“ see our page on [
Taking out a mortgage ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-
a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/taking-out-a-mortgage/) for details of these
rules.

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has a [ budget
planner ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/tools-and-calculators/budget-planner/)
that you can use to see how much you can afford each month.
