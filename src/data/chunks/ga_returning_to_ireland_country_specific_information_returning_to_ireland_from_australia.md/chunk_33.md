####  **Finding a school**

To find a school, you can search primary and post-primary schools by type and
location using the Department of Educationâ€™s [ Find a School tool
](https://www.education.ie/en/Find-a-School/) .

You can filter your search results by ethos, language of instruction, and
gender. You will see a map showing schools that meet your selection.

Most schools have a website with information about their ethos, policies,
curriculum, and extra-curricular activities. You can also contact a school
directly for more information.
