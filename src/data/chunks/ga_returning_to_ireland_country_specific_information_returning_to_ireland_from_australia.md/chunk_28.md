###  **Renting a home in Ireland**

In Ireland, the term ‘renting’ is usually used in everyday conversation.
Sometimes, you might hear words like ‘letting’, ‘tenancy agreement’, and
‘lease’ used as well.

To make sure you find somewhere that suits you, consider these questions
before viewing places to rent:

  * How much can you afford in rent and bills? 
  * What is the standard of the accommodation? 
  * What is the [ Building Energy Rating (BER) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/getting-a-building-energy-rating-for-your-home/) of the property? 
  * What is the location of the property? Is it near to your work or college? 
  * How long do you plan to stay there? 
  * Do you want to share a bedroom, bathroom, or kitchen?
