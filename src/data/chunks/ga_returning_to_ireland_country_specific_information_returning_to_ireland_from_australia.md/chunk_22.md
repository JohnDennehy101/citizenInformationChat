###  **General practitioners (GPs)**

General practitioners (GPs) are family doctors. A GP is often the first doctor
people see about a health problem.

GPs provide referrals to more specialised doctors called consultants. You
cannot see a consultant for the first time without a referral from a GP.

You can [ find a GP in your area with HSE Service Finder Map
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/gp/) . Some GPs will also arrange
home visits.
