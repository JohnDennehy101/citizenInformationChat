####  **Taxes in Ireland**  

If you plan to work when you are back in Ireland, you should know how your
income will be taxed. Tax in Ireland is charged as a percentage of your
income. The percentage you pay depends on how much you earn.

The first part of your income, up to a certain amount, is taxed at 20%. This
is known as the _standard rate of tax,_ and the amount that it applies to is
known as the _standard rate tax band_ .

The rest of your income is taxed at 40% and is called the _higher rate of tax_
.

The amount you can earn before you start to pay the higher rate of tax is
known as your _standard rate cut-off point_ . You can see [ examples of how to
calculate income tax ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/case-study-calculating-your-income-tax-case-studies/) using
these tax rates and the standard rate cut-off point.

If you are married or in a [ civil partnership
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/civil-
partnerships/civil-partnerships/) and both of you plan to work in Ireland, it
may affect your tax bands and tax reliefs.
