##  Types of PRSA

There are two types of PRSA:

  * Standard PRSA 
  * Non-Standard PRSA 

The main differences are:

  * The charges are capped for standard PRSAs but not for non-standard PRSAs 
  * Types of investment are restricted in standard PRSAs but not in non-standard PRSAs 

You can read more about the differences between Standard and Non-Standard
PRSAs in [ A consumer and employer's guide to PRSAs (pdf)
](https://pensionsauthority.ie/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/prsas_-
_a_consumer_and_employers_guide.pdf) produced by the Pensions Authority.

Standard PRSAs are likely to meet the needs of most people. The level of
charges on your account is important to consider, as the charges imposed
reduce the fund you can build up. On your retirement, the size of your fund
will depend on your contributions and the investment performance less any
charges. It is not possible to predict investment performance.

Charges on Non-Standard PRSAs are not capped and in most cases, are higher
than Standard PRSAs. If you are considering a Non-Standard PRSA, ask for a
full explanation of the differences between this product and the Standard
product. You should beware of promises of better returns on Non-Standard PRSA
products as predicting investment performance is extremely difficult.
