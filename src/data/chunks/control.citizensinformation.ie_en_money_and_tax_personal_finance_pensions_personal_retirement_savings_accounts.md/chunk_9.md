##  Complaints

The [ Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/making-a-pension-complaint/) can investigate and decide on
complaints, concerning disputes of fact or law and errors in relation to
occupational pension schemes and PRSAs. The Ombudsman can give any directions
necessary to resolve the complaint or dispute and can give financial
compensation. This financial compensation cannot be more than the actual loss
of benefit under the complainantâ€™s occupational pension scheme or PRSA. The
Ombudsman does not have the power to award legal costs. All decisions made by
the Ombudsman are binding between the parties but can be appealed to the [
High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) .
