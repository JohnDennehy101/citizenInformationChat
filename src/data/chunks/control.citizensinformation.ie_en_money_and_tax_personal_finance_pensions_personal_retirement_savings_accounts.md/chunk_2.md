##  What is a PRSA?

A Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) is a type of long-term personal
pension plan. It is like an investment account that is designed to let you
save for retirement in a flexible way.

Your PRSA is a contract between you and a PRSA provider in the form of an
investment account. You can change employment and continue to use the same
PRSA and you can switch from one PRSA to another at any time, free of charge.

You can get [ tax relief ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/tax-
relief-on-pensions/) for the contributions you pay into your PRSA.

When you retire, you have the same options with a PRSA as with other personal
pensions â€“ read about [ options on retirement for personal pensions
