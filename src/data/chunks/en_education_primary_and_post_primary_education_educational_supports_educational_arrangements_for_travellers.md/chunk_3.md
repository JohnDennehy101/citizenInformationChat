###  Co-ordination of Traveller education

The Advisory Committee on Traveller Education published a [ Report and
Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy (pdf) ](https://s3-eu-
west-1.amazonaws.com/govieassets/24633/d2c07c84c48f4a6e9984f15ff6d34728.pdf) .
A key objective of the report was the phasing out of segregated Traveller
provision and the inclusion of Traveller children and young people in
mainstream education.

Guidelines on Traveller education in primary schools and post-primary schools
are available from the Department of Education.

The Department of Education is responsible for the [ co-ordination of
Traveller education ](https://www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/531ef5-co-
ordination-of-traveller-education/) at primary and post primary level.

The Department of Further and Higher Education is responsible for Traveller
education at further education and higher education.
