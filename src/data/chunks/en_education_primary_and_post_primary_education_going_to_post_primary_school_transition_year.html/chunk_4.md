Each school designs its own TY programme, to suit the needs and interests of
its students. Schools must design the TY programme within set [ guidelines for
schools ](https://ncca.ie/en/updates-and-events/latest-news/2022/may/ty-
guidelines-for-schools-are-being-updated/) .

Areas of study may include:

  * Environmental studies 
  * Chinese culture and language studies 
  * Global development issues 
  * Debating development 
  * Tourism studies 
  * Student safety in the workplace 
  * Soap operas and popular culture 
  * Food matters 
  * Legal studies 
  * Sports coaching 
  * Introduction to genetics and biotechnology

Students can sample a wide range of subject areas and can make more informed
choices about the kind of Leaving Certificate programme they want to take
after the Transition Year. Work experience is a core aspect of the Transition
Year programme. It aims to bring new kinds of learning opportunities to
students by experiencing adult and working life.
