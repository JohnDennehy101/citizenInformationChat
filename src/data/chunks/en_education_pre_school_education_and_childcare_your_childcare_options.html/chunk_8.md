###  **Full day care**

Full day care is a structured service for children attending more than 5 hours
per day.

The childcare provider offers your child food and sleeping facilities, as well
as access to a safe outdoor space.

Full day care includes day nurseries and crèches. It can sometimes include
sessional services for children who aren’t attending full-time (see ‘sessional
services’ below).
