##  Choosing childcare

Deciding on childcare is a big decision for any parent. There are a number of
factors you need to consider.

These include:

  * Your child’s age 
  * Whether you need full-time or part-time care 
  * The hours you need services (regular, daytime, evenings or weekends) 
  * Your budget 
  * Services available in your area 

It is important to discuss with the childcare service provider your child’s
needs and the service they can provide. You should check that staff are
qualified, and the provider has appropriate childcare policies and procedures
in place (for example, policies for child protection, behaviour management,
and accidents).
