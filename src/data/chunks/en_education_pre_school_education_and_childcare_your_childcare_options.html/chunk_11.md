###  **Childminders**

Childminders care for children in the minder’s own home. A childminder can
care for up to 5 children under 6 years of age (including the childminder’s
own).

The service is usually offered for the full working day, or for different
periods during the day. Parents and childminders arrange their own terms and
conditions.
