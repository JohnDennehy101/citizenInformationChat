###  **National Childcare Scheme**

The [ National Childcare Scheme (NCS)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/national-childcare-scheme/) helps parents to meet childcare costs.

Families with children aged over 6 months (24 weeks) and under 15 years can
get childcare subsidies.

Your childcare provider must be:

  * [ Registered with Tusla ](https://www.ncs.gov.ie/en/childcare-search/) , and 
  * Have a NCS contract with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY) 

You [ apply for the subsidy
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/national-childcare-scheme/#16f160) , but it is paid directly to your
childcare provider. Your provider will then subtract the subsidy from your
childcare bill.

There is a **universal subsidy** and an **income-assessed subsidy** . You
canâ€™t get both subsidies at the same time, but you can choose which one is
better for you.
