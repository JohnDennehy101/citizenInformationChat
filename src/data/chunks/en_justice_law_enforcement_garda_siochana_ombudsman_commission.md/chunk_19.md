###  **Garda Investigation** **under Garda Ombudsman supervision**

The Garda Ombudsman may decide to supervise the Garda disciplinary
investigation of your complaint if there is a public interest to do so.

The Garda Ombudsman and the Gardaí will agree how the investigation should be
handled. The Gardaí will provide progress updates to the Garda Ombudsman as
they investigate the complaint.

The Garda Ombudsman can:

  * Direct the Garda investigation
