####  **Review of complaints investigated by the Gardaí**

Where the investigation was completed by the Gardaí (and not under Garda
Ombudsman supervision), you can ask the Garda Ombudsman to review how it was
handled.

It is important to note that the Garda Ombudsman:

  * Does not investigate the complaint again 
  * Cannot overrule a decision 

If the Garda Ombudsman finds an issue with the investigation, they tell the
Garda Commissioner who decides how to proceed next.
