###  **Local intervention**

If your complaint is about a service issue, such as discourtesy or low-level
neglect, the Garda Ombudsman may decide it is suitable for [ local
intervention ](https://www.gardaombudsman.ie/make-a-complaint/before-you-
complain/how-we-deal-with-complaints/local-intervention/) .

You will be asked for your consent to deal with the complaint in this way. If
you consent, the Garda Ombudsman will send the complaint to a nominated Garda
Inspector who will try to resolve the complaint with you.

If you are happy with the outcome, the complaint will be closed.

If you are unhappy with the outcome, or if you do not consent to local
intervention, the Garda Ombudsman will decide if the case is admissible.
