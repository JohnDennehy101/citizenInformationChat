###  **Garda Ombudsman non-criminal investigation**

If a complaint is about non-criminal matters, the Garda Ombudsman may decide
to conduct the investigation itself.

These investigations are only concerned with finding out if there was a breach
of Garda regulations. These regulations are set out in [ Garda Síochána
(Discipline) Regulations 2007
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2007/si/214/made/en/print?q=Garda+S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na+Discipline+Regulations+2007)
.

You can read more about this type of investigation in the Garda Ombudsman’s [
non-criminal investigations leaflet (pdf)
