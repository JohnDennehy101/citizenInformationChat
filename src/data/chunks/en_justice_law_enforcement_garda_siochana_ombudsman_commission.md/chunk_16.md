###  **Garda Ombudsman criminal investigation**

If a complaint is about a possible [ criminal offence ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-offences/classification-of-crimes-in-criminal-cases/) , the Garda
Ombudsman will conduct the investigation itself.

The Garda Ombudsman always investigates where a complaint relates to somebody
who died or was harmed during a Garda operation, or while in Garda custody or
care.

You can read more about this type of investigation in the Garda Ombudsmanâ€™s [
criminal investigations leaflet (pdf) ](https://www.gardaombudsman.ie/make-a-
