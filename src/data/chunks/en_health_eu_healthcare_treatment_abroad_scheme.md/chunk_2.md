##  How does the Treatment Abroad Scheme work?

If you are a public healthcare patient and require treatment that is not
available to you in Ireland, you may be able to apply for the Treatment Abroad
Scheme (TAS). This allows you to get the medical treatment in another country
in the [ European Union (EU) ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/european-union/european-union/) , the European Economic Area (the
EEA also includes Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) or in Switzerland.

Before you travel for your treatment, the HSE must assess and approve your
application.

If the treatment is available in Ireland you can access it abroad using the [
Cross-Border Healthcare Directive ](/en/health/eu-healthcare/cross-border-
directive/) .
