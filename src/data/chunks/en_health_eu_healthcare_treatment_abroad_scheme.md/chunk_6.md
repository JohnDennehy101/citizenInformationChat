###  What happens after my TAS application is approved?

If your application is approved, this means the HSE will pay for some or all
of the cost of the treatment abroad. The HSE will issue you an approval letter
that tells you what to do next.

Your application must be approved by the HSE before you travel or start
treatment abroad. You must give the HSE information about every appointment
that you are due to attend.
