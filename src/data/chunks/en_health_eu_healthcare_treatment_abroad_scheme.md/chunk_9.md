###  Private patients

If you are a private patient, you cannot be referred for the scheme by a
private hospital consultant.

You should apply to your private health insurance provider to fund the
treatment abroad. If your private health insurance provider declines your
application and you have been refused on appeal, you can then apply to the
Treatment Abroad Scheme.

When applying for TAS as a private patient you need to show your:

  * Declined application from your insurance provider 
  * Documents to show you have tried to appeal the insurance providers decision
