##  How to qualify for the Treatment Abroad Scheme

You must be [ ordinarily resident ](/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-
public-health-services#l0b797) in Ireland to qualify for the Treatment Abroad
Scheme. This means you live in Ireland and intend to live here for at least
one year.

The medical treatment you need must be either:

  * Not available in Ireland **or**
  * Not available within the time normally necessary to get it in Ireland, taking into account your current health and the likely course of your condition or disease 

You cannot refer yourself for TAS. Only a public hospital consultant based in
Ireland can refer you for treatment abroad. A GP cannot refer you for this
scheme.
