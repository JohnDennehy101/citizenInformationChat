##  Moneylender loans

Moneylenders usually lend smaller amounts at a high interest rate for a short
time. Banks, building societies, insurance companies and credit unions are not
considered moneylenders.

Some shops may be registered as moneylenders if they offer credit at an
interest rate of 23%APR or higher.

You should always make sure that your moneylender is regulated. Check the
