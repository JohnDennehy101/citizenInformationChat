##  Using your account from another country

If you are returning to Ireland from another SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)
country, you can continue using your bank account from that country, for
payments and transfers in euro.

For example, your new employer in Ireland can pay your wages into your German
account.

You can also set up direct debits with Irish utility companies using your
International Bank Account Number (IBAN) from another SEPA country.

This means you do not need to open a new Irish bank account to be paid by your
employer or to pay for utilities.

If you make a euro payment to another EU country, your bank cannot charge you
more than it would to make the transaction within your country.

This applies to electronic transactions including:

  * Bank account transfers 
  * Debit or credit card payments 
  * Direct debits 
  * Cash machine (ATM) withdrawals
