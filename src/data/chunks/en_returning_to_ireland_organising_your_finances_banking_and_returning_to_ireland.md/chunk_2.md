##  Opening a bank account

If you are returning to Ireland, you may want to open an Irish bank account.

Before you [ open a bank account
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/banking/opening-a-bank-account/) , you must [ show proof of identity
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/banking/financial-institutions-and-identification/) (such as a valid
passport or driving licence) and proof of address (such a recent utility
bill). In general, this means you cannot open an Irish bank account until you
have arrived home.

You may not need to open a bank account in Ireland if you already have an
account in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) - see 'Using your account from
another country' below.

If you need a bank account in Ireland, some banks offer 'non-resident'
accounts, which you may be able to open before you return home - see more
below.

If you are resident in another European Union (EU) country and you do not have
a bank account in Ireland, you can open a 'basic bank account', which you can
use for everyday banking.
