####  **SEPA, the UK and Brexit**

Although the United Kingdom left the European Union in 2020 (often called
‘Brexit’), the UK continues to be part of SEPA.

This means you can continue to use your UK IBAN for payments and transfers in
euro. You may be asked to give additional information, such as the BIC code
and address of your bank.
