##  Non-resident bank accounts

Some banks in Ireland offer ‘non-resident’ accounts. This means you might be
able to set up an Irish bank account before you return home.

You still must prove your identity and address (this requirement is set out in
[ anti-money laundering legislation
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/banking/money-laundering-in-ireland/) ), but the bank may accept a
foreign utility bill, for example, if it has been certified by a solicitor or
police officer.

Different banks have their own requirements, so you should contact your
preferred bank directly for advice.
