###  **Do I have to own the property to qualify?**

You do not have to own the property to qualify for rent-a-room relief. You
could be a tenant and be sub-letting to someone else. In this case, you should
check with your landlord that sub-letting is allowed.

Since 1 December 2023, [ local authority tenants are able to rent out a room
to a third level student ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/35486-housing-

your local authority first.
