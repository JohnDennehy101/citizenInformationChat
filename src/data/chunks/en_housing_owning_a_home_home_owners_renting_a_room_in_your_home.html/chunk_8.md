###  Your expenses

You cannot deduct expenses from your rental income when claiming rent-a-room
relief.

In some circumstances, choosing not to claim the rent-a-room relief for a
specific year could be beneficial. In that year, you could instead deduct
expenses from the rental income and use wear and tear allowances. See [
revenue.ie ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-
exemptions/land-and-property/rent-a-room-relief/how-is-relief-granted.aspx)
for examples of when this can be beneficial.
