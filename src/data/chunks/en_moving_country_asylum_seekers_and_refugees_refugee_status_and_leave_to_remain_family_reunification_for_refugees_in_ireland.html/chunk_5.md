##  How to apply for family reunification

You must apply in writing to the Family Reunification Section of Immigration
Services Delivery - see 'Where to apply' below. Write a letter that says you
want to apply for family reunification and include:

  * Your name, your Person ID number (from your Irish Residence Permit IRP or previous letters from ISD) and address. 
  * The full name, date of birth, nationality and address for each family member you want to apply for. You must also say what relationship they have to you. 

ISD will then send you a questionnaire to complete. You must complete this
within 28 days and return it with the documents listed on the questionnaire.
