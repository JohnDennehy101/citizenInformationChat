##  Introduction

If you are granted international protection ( [ refugee status ](/en/moving-
country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/refugees-
asylum-seekers-introduction#lad40a) or [ subsidiary protection ](/en/moving-
country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/the-asylum-process-in-ireland/refugees-
asylum-seekers-introduction#l50016) ) in Ireland, you can apply to the
Minister for Justice for close family members to join you in Ireland. Your
right to _family reunification_ is set out in the [ International Protection
Act 2015 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/act/66/enacted/en/html) .

If you have another residence status, (for example, [ permission to remain
](/en/moving-country/asylum-seekers-and-refugees/refugee-status-and-leave-to-
remain/permission-to-remain/) ) you do not have a right to family
reunification. Your family can apply to join you in Ireland but must satisfy
the [ criteria for a join family visa ](/en/moving-country/moving-to-
ireland/rights-of-residence-in-ireland/residence-rights-of-family-members/) ,
which includes rules on how much income you must have to support them.

You apply for permission for your family member (s) either:

  * To enter and reside in the State if they are living outside the State or 
  * To reside in the State if they are already in the State on the date of your application
