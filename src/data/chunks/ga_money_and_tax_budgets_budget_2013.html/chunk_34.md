####  One-Parent Family Payment

The age reductions in the One-Parent Family Payment which were due to apply
from the beginning of 2013 and 2014 are being deferred to the beginning of
July in each of those years. In addition, the period over which the
transitional arrangements applying to existing recipients are to apply, will
be extended from the end of 2014 to the beginning of July 2015. This change
will provide more time for the creation of additional childcare places (see
also 'Children Plus Initiative' below). This provision requires legislation
and is not yet in effect. (This measure was not announced in Budget 2013 - it
was inserted into the Social Welfare Bill 2012.)
