##  Rules for direct marketing by email or text

A company can send you direct marketing emails or text messages if you have
given your _explicit consent_ within the last 12 months. Explicit consent
means you have been given a clear option to say yes or no to future contact.

They can also send you direct marketing emails or text messages if the
following conditions are met:

  * They got your personal contact details by selling you a product or service within the last 12 months 
  * They told you their identity, the purpose for collecting your contact details, who your data may be shared with and any other information needed for fair processing of your data 
  * They are only marketing products and services to you that are similar to the one you bought or subscribed to 
  * You were given the opportunity to opt out of marketing by email at the time your details were collected and each time you are contacted following that (for example, by providing an ‘unsubscribe’ option) 

A company can't send you direct marketing emails or text messages if:

  * You have not given your consent within the last 12 months in one of the ways described above 
  * You can't tell who the sender is because their identity has been disguised or hidden 
  * You are not given a valid address to send an opt-out request 

These rules are set out in the ePrivacy Regulations.
