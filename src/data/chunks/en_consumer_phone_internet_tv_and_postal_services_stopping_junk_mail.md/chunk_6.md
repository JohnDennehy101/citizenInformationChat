##  How to stop unsolicited email or text

You can stop an unsolicited email or text by sending an unsubscribe or opt-out
request to the company who sent you the email or text.

The company must give you a valid address to send your opt-out request. For
example, you should have the option to click ‘unsubscribe’ at the bottom of
the email or reply ‘STOP’ to a text.

If you tell the sender that you do not want to receive any more emails or
texts, they must stop. It is an offence for companies to send emails or texts
to you without your clear consent.
