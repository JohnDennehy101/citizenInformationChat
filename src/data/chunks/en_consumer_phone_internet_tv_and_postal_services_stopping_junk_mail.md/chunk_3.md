##  Rules for junk mail

It is legal for a company to send you direct mail such as advertisements and
special offers, however you have the right to have your details removed from a
direct marketing database.

The rules on direct marketing do not apply to:

  * Mail you get from overseas 
  * Promotional material with no address 
  * Material addressed to ‘the householder’, ‘the occupier’ or ‘the occupant’
