###  Employer eligibility review

You had to undertake a review of your eligibility for the scheme. This had to
be done on the last day of every month (other than the final month of the
scheme). Online monthly EWSS Eligibility Review Form had to be completed and
submitted through ROS.

You can get more information on eligibility reviews in [ Revenueâ€™s Guidelines
on eligibility for the EWSS from 1 July 2021 (pdf)
