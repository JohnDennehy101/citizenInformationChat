###  Proofs required

Applications for EWSS were based on self-assessment principles. This means you
did not have to provide proof of eligibility to Revenue at the registration
stage. Revenue will review eligibility in the future, based on risk criteria -
see ‘Compliance checks’ below.

You should keep proof of your eligibility for the scheme (evidence of
reduction in turnover and other evidence). You can read detailed information
on the supporting proofs in Appendix I of [ Revenue’s EWSS Guidelines (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/communications/documents/ewss-
guidelines.pdf) .
