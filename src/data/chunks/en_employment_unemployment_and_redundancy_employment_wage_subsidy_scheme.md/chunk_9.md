####  Reduction in turnover or customer orders test

You must self-declare to Revenue that you have experienced significant
negative economic disruption due to COVID-19, with a minimum of 30% decline in
turnover or customer orders over a 12 month period (extended from 6 months
under the Economic Recovery Plan). The review of turnover or orders should
look at the period as whole, not individual months. For new businesses, this
is based on a projected forward test.

If you are a charity that is getting special grant funding under the
Governmentâ€™s Charity Stability Scheme, the funding may be excluded from the
definition of turnover in assessing your eligibility for the EWSS. You can
contact the Revenue division or branch responsible for your tax affairs for
further guidance.

If you are a registered childcare provider, you do not need to meet the 30%
reduction in turnover or customer orders test.
