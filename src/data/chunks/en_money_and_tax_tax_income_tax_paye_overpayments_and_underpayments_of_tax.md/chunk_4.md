##  How to check if you are due a tax refund or owe tax for a previous year

You can use [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) to check
whether you have paid the correct amount of tax in the previous 4 years. You
can see a statement that shows if you have paid too much tax or too little
tax. This is called a Preliminary End of Year Statement. It is based on the
information Revenue has.

There may be other information that could affect how much you owe. For
example, you may have other income or you may be entitled to tax credits that
you have not claimed. To get a final statement, you must [ get a Statement of
Liability ](how_to_review_your_tax_for_PAYE_taxpayers.en.html#lab7df) .

For detailed information about how to get a preliminary and final statement,
see [ How to review your tax for PAYE taxpayers ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/how-to-review-your-paye-tax/) .
