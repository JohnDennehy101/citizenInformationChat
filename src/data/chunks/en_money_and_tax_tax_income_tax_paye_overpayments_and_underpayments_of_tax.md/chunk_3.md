##  How to check your tax credits for this year

Your tax credit certificate shows the [ tax credits ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-reliefs/introduction-to-income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/) that your employer is deducting from your tax bill this year. You
can view your tax certificate online using [ myAccount
](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) .

If you find out during the year that your tax credits are not correct, contact
Revenue so that any refund due can be paid to you by your employer. It is also
important to check that you are not claiming tax credits you are not entitled
to, as this will result in an underpayment of tax.
