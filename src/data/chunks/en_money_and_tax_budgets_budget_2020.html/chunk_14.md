###  Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT)

**VRT Environmental Health (NOx) Surcharge**

A nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions-based charge will replace the 1% diesel
surcharge introduced in Budget 2019. The charge will be based on emissions of
milligrams per kilometre and capped at a maximum of €4,850 for diesel vehicles
and €600 for other vehicles. It will apply to passenger cars and SUVs
registered for the first time from 1 January 2020.

**VRT relief**

Current VRT relief for hybrids and plug-in electric vehicles will be extended
until 31 December 2020.
