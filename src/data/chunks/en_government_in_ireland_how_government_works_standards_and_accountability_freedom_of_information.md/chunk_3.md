##  Organisations that are covered by FOI

FOI laws apply to public bodies unless they are exempt. FOI bodies include:

  * Government departments 
  * Bodies that were set up by an Act of the Oireachtas (for example, the Consumer and Competition Authority was set up by the Consumer and Competition Protection Act 2014), or established by a Minister or the Government 
  * A company where the majority of the shares are held by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government, or any of its subsidiaries 
  * A higher education institute that is publicly funded 
  * Some non-public bodies that get a lot of public funding 

A [ full list of FOI bodies ](https://foi.gov.ie/all-foi-bodies/) is on the
website of the FOI policy unit.

Some information, even if it is held by an FOI body, is exempt from FOI (see
‘Your rights under FOI’ below).

If you want to request information that is held on you by a company or
organisation that is not listed, you can [ make a subject access request under
data protection law ](/en/government-in-ireland/data-protection/rights-under-
general-data-protection-regulation/) (the GDPR).
