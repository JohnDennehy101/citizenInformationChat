###  Charges for search, retrieval and copying

You may also be charged for the time the body spends searching and retrieving
records, and for copying costs. If the cost is under €101, no charge applies.
If the cost is above this, you will be charged in full, up to a maximum of
€500.

It is unlikely that you will be charged for personal records unless there is a
very large quantity.

If the cost for the time and copying would be greater than €700, the FOI body
can refuse to process your request unless you revise your request to bring the
costs down below €700.
