####  Schengen Information System (SIS)

EU member states use the Schengen Information System (SIS) to share
information about security and border management. Countries can issue a SIS
alert about a person or object, which also includes information about what to
do if that person or object has been found.

Ireland is connected to SIS. This means that Ireland can send and receive
alerts on people and objects. These alerts are used to help trace missing
people, people who are wanted by the police in a member state, and/or objects
that are missing or stolen.
