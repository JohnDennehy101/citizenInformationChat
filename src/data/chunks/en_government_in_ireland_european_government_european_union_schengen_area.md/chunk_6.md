##  European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS)

The [ European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS)
](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias_en) is due to start in 2025. People
from countries outside the EU and EEA who **do not** need a visa to enter the
Schengen Area, will need to get an ETIAS before they travel. This system will
be similar to the ESTA system for travelling to the United States.

The [ European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS)
](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias_en) will cover travel to the Schengen
Area and Cyprus.

If approved, your ETIAS is valid for 3 years or until your passport expires.
You can move freely within the Schengen Area (and to the countries above)
after your arrival, for up to 90 days.

Applicants will need to pay a fee and apply online giving some basic personal
information.
