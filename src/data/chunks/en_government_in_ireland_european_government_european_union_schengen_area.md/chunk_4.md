###  Where do I apply for a Schengen visa?

You only need to make one visa application for your visit, even if you plan to
travel to more than one country in the Schengen Area. There are rules about
which countryâ€™s embassy you should make your visa application to:

  * If you are visiting one country in the Schengen Area, you should apply to the embassy of the country you plan to visit 
  * If you are visiting more than one country, you should make your application to the embassy of the country where you plan to spend the most time 
  * If you are spending the same amount of time in more than one country, you should apply to the embassy of the country where you are going first
