##  Introduction

The Schengen Area is the name given to a region of Europe without border
checks between countries.

Ireland is **not** part of the Schengen Area, which means that if you travel
to the Schengen Area from Ireland, you pass through an immigration checkpoint
and have to show your passport or national identity card.

The Schengen Area includes the [ member states of the EU ](https://european-
union.europa.eu/easy-read_en) except for Ireland and Cyprus.

It also includes:

  * Iceland 
  * Liechtenstein 
  * Norway 
  * Switzerland 

Bulgaria and Romania lifted checks at their internal air and sea borders from
31 March 2024. Checks at their internal land borders will be lifted at a time
to be decided by the Council of the European Union.

The Schengen Area was created following the Schengen Agreement, named after
the village in Luxemburg where it was signed in 1985. The Schengen Convention,
which followed in 1990, set out more details on the operation of the
borderless area.

Ireland takes part in some of the policing co-operation agreements that are
part of the Schengen Agreement - see ‘Policing and security’ below for more
information.
