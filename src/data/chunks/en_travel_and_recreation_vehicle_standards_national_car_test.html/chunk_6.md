##  NCT test results

All vehicles receive an NCT Vehicle Inspection Report after the test. The
report details test results and explains what faults (if any) have been found.
You will also receive a pass certificate if your car has passed the test.

There are 3 types of test results that you can get. A minor result, a major
result, or a dangerous result.
