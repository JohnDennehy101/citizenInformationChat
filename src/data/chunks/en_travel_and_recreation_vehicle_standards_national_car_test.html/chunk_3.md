###  Delays getting NCT certificates

There are delays with the NCT, which means you might not get your NCT
appointment on time. If you cannot get your NCT because of these delays, [ in
most cases your insurance cover will continue to be provided
](https://www.rsa.ie/services/alerts/driving-test-updates) . You must have
tried to book an appointment in the normal way for this to apply.

Insurance Ireland has stated that insurance companies should be understanding
if you canâ€™t get an NCT appointment, due to backlogs at NCT test centres.
However, you must always keep your vehicle in a roadworthy condition under
motor insurance and road traffic legislation, which is still the case. If you
want to know more about this, you should contact your insurance company about
your policy.
