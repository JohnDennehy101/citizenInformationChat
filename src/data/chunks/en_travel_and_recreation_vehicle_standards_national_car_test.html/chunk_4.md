##  Format of the NCT test

NCTS has a [ network of operating centres nationwide
](https://www.ncts.ie/1106) . You must bring your car to one of these test
centres to take the test.

The test looks at:

  * Brakes 
  * Exhaust emissions 
  * Wheels and tyres 
  * Lights 
  * Steering and suspension 
  * Chassis and underbody 
  * Electrical systems 
  * Glass and mirrors 
  * Transmission 
  * Interior 
  * Fuel system 

An [ on-board diagnostics testing system ](https://www.ncts.ie/1157/) (OBD) is
used during an NCT inspection. It scans your vehicle for its vehicle
identification number, the odometer reading, the electronic braking system and
the anti-lock braking system.

Since 20 May 2023, [ On-Board Fuel Consumption Monitoring (OBFCM) data has
been collected as part of the NCT test ](https://www.ncts.ie/1157/) . This
ensures that the car's CO2 emissions and fuel or energy consumption values
meet EU regulations. If you do not want this data stored, you can email your
name, address and car registration number to [ privacy@ncts.ie
](mailto:privacy@ncts.ie) . This only applies to the current test cycle and
not future tests. All data collected will be anonymized. Find out more on the
[ NCT website ](https://www.ncts.ie/1157/) .

The [ National Car Test (NCT) Manual (pdf)
](https://www.ncts.ie/media/aidher01/nct_manual_2023.pdf) is available on the
NCT website.
