##  Transferring an EU Roadworthiness Certificate to an NCT

If you are importing a car from another EU country and you have a current EU
Roadworthiness Certificate, you can continue to use it in Ireland until it
expires. You no longer transfer the unexpired portion of an EU certificate for
a mutual recognition cert. You should apply and pass the NCT before the expiry
of your EU Roadworthiness Certificate. See the [ FAQs on nct.ie
](https://www.ncts.ie/1123/) . Read more about [ importing a vehicle into
