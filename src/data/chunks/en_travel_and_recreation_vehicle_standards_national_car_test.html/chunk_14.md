##  Cost of NCT

The test costs €55 and takes between 40 minutes - 1 hour to conduct. It
involves [ approximately 60 different checks ](https://www.ncts.ie/1109/)
which will be carried out both by computer and manually.

According to the [ NCTS Customer Charter ](https://www.ncts.ie/customer-
charter/) if you request an NCT appointment within 4 weeks and it cannot be
provided, you are entitled to have the test carried out for free.

If your car fails the test, you must book a re-test within 21 days and the re-
test must be completed within 30 days of the original test. A re-test costs
€28. Re-tests that do not require the use of test equipment are free. (Free
re-tests include minor visual items such as the replacement of a windscreen
wiper).

If you cancel your confirmed appointment with less than 5 working days' notice
(Monday to Friday, not including the day of the test) or if you do not turn up
for your test, you will be charged an extra €22 (on top of the usual fee) when
you next bring your vehicle for testing.
