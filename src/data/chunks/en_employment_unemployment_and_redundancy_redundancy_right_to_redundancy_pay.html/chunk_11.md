##  If you are a seasonal worker

If you are a seasonal worker and have at least 2 yearsâ€™ service with your
employer you may qualify for redundancy.

The 2 years does not include the time you are off work. The question of
redundancy does not arise until the usual time when your seasonal work would
start. If you are not re-employed then, you may be entitled to a redundancy
payment.
