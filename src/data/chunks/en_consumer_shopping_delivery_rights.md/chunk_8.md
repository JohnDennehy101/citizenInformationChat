##  Getting your refund

If the seller fails to deliver your goods within 30 days or the specified
date, you can cancel the contract and get a refund of all the money you paid
(including delivery) without delay.

For goods bought at a _distance_ (that is online, by phone or away from the
business premises), you have the right to cancel your order within the
cooling-off period (14 days from delivery) without having to give a reason.
However, you may have to pay for the cost of returning the goods. Always check
the returns policy before buying.

Where you use your right to cancel, you must be refunded for the full amount
you paid, including the standard delivery costs to send the item to you. You
are only entitled to a refund for standard delivery. If you chose to pay more
for next day, express or nominated day delivery, the seller only has to refund
you for standard delivery.

The trader must give you your refund within 14 days. The refund must be in the
same form as the original payment unless you agree some other method. For
example, if you originally paid in cash, you can insist on any refund also
being in cash.
