##  Introduction

If you bought something from a business, to be delivered, the seller must
deliver the goods within 30 days. This applies unless:

  * You agree a different arrangement with the seller 
  * The seller is based outside the EU 

If you agree a specific date for delivery of the goods as part of the contract
and you do not get the goods on or before that date, you can cancel and get a
refund.

Because your contract is with the seller (and not the courier or delivery
service) it is the sellerâ€™s responsibility to make sure the item is delivered
to you.

This page explains your rights and some of the most common consumer problems
with late or non-delivery, items damaged or lost and additional costs.
