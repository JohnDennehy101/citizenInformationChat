###  Income liable for the USC

The Universal Social Charge is a tax you pay on gross income, including
notional pay (notional pay is a non-cash benefit, such as benefit-in-kind),
after any relief for certain capital allowances. The USC is payable on pension
contributions.

If your total income is €13,000 or less per year, you do not pay any USC. If
it is more than €13,000 per year, you pay USC on your full income.

For married couples or civil partners, each spouse or civil partner is treated
individually by their employer or pension provider throughout the year.

Liability for the USC depends on the date of the payment rather than when the
income was earned.

Although you may not have to pay income tax based on your entitlement to tax
credits or by use of losses or capital allowances, you may still have to pay
the Universal Social Charge on your income.

Some sources of income are exempt from income tax but are liable to the
Universal Social Charge. These include income from:

  * The occupation of certain woodlands 
  * Profits from stallion fees 
  * Stud greyhound services fees and farmland leasing 
  * Patent royalty income 
  * [ Earnings of certain writers, artists and composers ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/artists-exemption-from-income-tax/)
