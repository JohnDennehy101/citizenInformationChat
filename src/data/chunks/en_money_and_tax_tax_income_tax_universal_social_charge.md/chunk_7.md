###  Maintenance payments

How [ maintenance payments ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-
divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) are treated for Universal Social
Charge purposes depends on whether they are voluntary payments or legally
enforceable payments.

Voluntary maintenance payments (payments paid under an informal arrangement):

  * The spouse making the payments does not receive exemption from the Universal Social Charge on the portion of their income that they pay as maintenance. 
  * The spouse who receives the payments is not subject to the Universal Social Charge on the maintenance payments they receive. 

Legally enforceable maintenance payments (payable under legal obligation):

  * The spouse making the payments is entitled to receive an exemption from the Universal Social Charge on the portion of their income on the maintenance that they pay, either directly or indirectly, to their spouse. There is no exemption for any portion of the maintenance payments paid towards the maintenance of children. 
  * An employee wishing to claim Universal Social Charge exemption for legally enforceable maintenance payments throughout the year may either give the information required to their payroll office, or they can apply to Revenue at the end of the year to claim any refund of Universal Social Charge due. 
  * The spouse who receives the payments is subject to the Universal Social Charge on the portion of the maintenance payments that they receive in respect of themselves. Any portion of the maintenance payments paid towards the maintenance of children is not subject to the Universal Social Charge. 

In the case of a legally enforceable maintenance arrangement, where a
separated couple has jointly elected to be treated as a married couple for
income tax purposes, the spouse making the payments does not receive exemption
from the Universal Social Charge on the portion of their income that they pay
as maintenance. The spouse who receives the payments is not subject to the
Universal Social Charge on the maintenance payments that they receive.
