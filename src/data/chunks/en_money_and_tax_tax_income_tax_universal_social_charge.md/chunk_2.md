##  Introduction

The Universal Social Charge (USC) is a tax on income.

You pay the USC if your gross income is more than â‚¬13,000 per year. Once your
income is over this limit, you pay the relevant rate of USC on all of your
income. It is calculated on a weekly or monthly basis.

It does not apply to social welfare or similar payments, and there are certain
other exceptions: see 'Income exempt from the USC' below.
