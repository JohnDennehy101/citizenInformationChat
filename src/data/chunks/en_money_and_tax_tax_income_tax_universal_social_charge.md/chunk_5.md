###  Income exempt from the USC

You do not pay the USC if your total income for a year is €13,000 or less. (If
your income is €60,000 or less, there is a reduced rate if you are aged 70 or
over or a medical card holder.)

All Department of Social Protection payments, including [ Maternity Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/maternity-benefit/) , [ Paternity
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/paternity-benefit/) and [
State pensions ](/en/social-welfare/older-and-retired-people/) , are exempt
from the Universal Social Charge. Similar payments, such as payments made as
part of [ Community Employment schemes ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/) or the [
Back to Education Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-to-
education-allowance/) , are exempt. Social welfare or similar payments made
from abroad are exempt. Student grants and scholarships are also exempt.

Income where [ DIRT (Deposit Interest Retention Tax) ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/tax-on-savings-and-investments/deposit-interest-retention-tax/) has
already been paid is exempt from the USC.

There are a number of other exemptions. These include:

  * Certain salary sacrifice schemes, such as the [ TaxSaver Commuter Ticket Scheme ](/en/travel-and-recreation/public-transport/public-transport-commuter-tickets-and-tax/) and the [ Cycle to Work scheme ](/en/travel-and-recreation/cycling/cycle-to-work-scheme/)
  * [ Statutory redundancy payments ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-payments/)
  * [ Foster care payments ](/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-and-fostering/fostering/)
