##  Rates

If your income is €13,000 or less, you pay no Universal Social Charge (USC).
Once your income is over this limit, you pay the relevant rate of USC on _all_
of your income. For example, if you have income of €13,000 you will pay no
USC. If you have income of €13,001 you will pay 0.5% on income up to €12,012
and 2% on income between €12,012 and €13,001.

Reduced rates of USC apply to:

  * People aged 70 or over whose total income for the year is €60,000 or less 
  * Medical card holders aged under 70 whose total income for the year is €60,000 or less 

Total income for USC purposes does not include payments from the Department of
Social Protection.

You must hold a full medical card or a Health Amendment Act Card to qualify
for the reduced rate. People who hold a GP visit card, a Drugs Payment Scheme
Card, a European Health Insurance Card or a Long-term Illness Scheme Card do
not qualify for the reduced rate. If a person reaches 70 years at any stage
during the year, they will benefit from the maximum 2% rate for the whole
year.

If you hold Northern Ireland medical card, you are not treated as holding a
full medical card and will not qualify for a reduced rate.
