##  Family members

Free movement applies to certain family members, even if they are not EU, EEA
or Swiss citizens. This means that certain family members can live in another
EU, EEA member state or Switzerland if you can show that you are lawfully
resident there.

Free movement does not generally apply to EU, EEA or Swiss nationals, when
they are living in their own country of nationality. This means that family
members of EU, EEA or Swiss nationals may have stronger residence rights in a
particular country than a family member of a national of that country.

If you are an EU, EEA or Swiss national and you plan to move to Ireland with
your non-EU/EEA or Swiss family, you should check if they need a [ visa to
enter Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/visa-requirements-for-
entering-ireland/) . They can only apply for residence from within the State.
The application process for a visa and for residence depends on the
relationship between you and your family member.
