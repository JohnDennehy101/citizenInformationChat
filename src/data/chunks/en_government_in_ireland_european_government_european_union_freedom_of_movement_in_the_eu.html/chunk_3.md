##  Which EU and national laws apply to free movement?

[ Article 45 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union
](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A12008E045)
grants free movement to workers. [ The Maastricht Treaty 1992
](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/about-parliament/en/in-the-past/the-
parliament-and-the-treaties/maastricht-treaty) created  EU citizenship  and
widened the scope of free movement. EU treaties have direct effect in Ireland,
which means that the treaties are part of Irish law.

[ EU Directive 2004/38/EC ](https://eur-
lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0077:0123:en:PDF)
(known as the ‘Citizens’ Rights Directive’) sets out rules that member states
must follow, including how free movement applies to family members of EU
citizens, and what happens to the EU citizen’s residence rights if they lose
their job, or become ill. EU Directive 2004/38/EC was transposed (or was
entered into Irish law) by [ European Communities (Free Movement of Persons)
Regulations 2015
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/548/made/en/print) .
