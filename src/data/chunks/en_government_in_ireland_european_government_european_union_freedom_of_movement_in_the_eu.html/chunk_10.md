##  What to do if your free movemen trights are denied

Freedom of movement rights can be denied in a number of ways. For example:

  * You could be denied entry to another EU/EEA country or Switzerland 
  * You could face discrimination in another EU/EEA country or Switzerland that prevents you from accessing the labour market 
  * You could be removed from an EU/EEA country or Switzerland for reasons other than those that are allowed in EU law 
  * Your family could be denied the right to join you in the EU/EEA country or Switzerland where you live 
  * You have been denied healthcare, public housing, or another State service that is provided to nationals of the country 
  * Your qualifications have not been recognised in the new EU/EEA country or Switzerland
