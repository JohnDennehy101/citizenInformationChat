##  Introduction

Citizens of EU member states are automatically citizens of the [ European
Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/european-
union/) . This means that they can move freely around the countries of the EU,
and have the right to live in those other countries if they meet certain
conditions.

Freedom of movement applies to all EU member states, although restrictions can
be placed on new members to the EU. It also applies to Norway, Iceland and
Lichtenstein (who make up the EEA alongside the 27 EU member states) and
Switzerland.

UK citizens have the separate right to live and work in Ireland through the [
Common Travel Area ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/common-
travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/) . Irish citizens have the same rights
to live and work in the UK.
