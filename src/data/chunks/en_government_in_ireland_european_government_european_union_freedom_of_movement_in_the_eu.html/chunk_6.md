##  Staying in another EU state for over 90 days

If you want to remain in an EU, EEA state or Switzerland for more than 90
days, you may be asked to show that you are:

  * In employment 
  * Self-employed 
  * A full time student with health insurance and money to support yourself 
  * You have money to support yourself and health insurance (for you and your family) without state assistance 

Qualifying family members of EU citizens, EEA nationals and Swiss citizens
from these categories also have a right to live in another state for more than
90 days. See ‘ [ Family members ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/european-union/freedom-of-movement-in-the-eu#ld773b) ’ below for
more information.

If you stay in another EU or EEA state or Switzerland for over 90 days and are
not in any of the above categories, you could be given a Removal Order.

In Ireland, EU, EEA or Swiss citizens do not have to register their presence
in the State with the authorities. This means that you will not have to show
that you are in one of the above categories unless:

  * Your spouse, partner or dependent family member is not from the EU, EEA or Switzerland and is applying for residence 
  * You apply for a social assistance payment and must satisfy the [ Habitual Residence Condition ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/)
  * You apply for permanent residency for yourself, or your family (this is available after 5 years’ lawful residence)
