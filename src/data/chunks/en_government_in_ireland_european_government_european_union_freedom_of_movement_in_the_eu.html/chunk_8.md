###  Qualifying and permitted family members

Visas for qualified family members should be free of charge and fast-tracked,
and applications for residency should be free of charge and processed within 6
months. The following are **qualifying family members** :

  * Your spouse or civil partner 
  * Your child or the child of your spouse under the age of 21 
  * Your grandchild or your spouseâ€™s grandchild under the age of 21 
  * Your dependent parent, or dependent parent of your spouse 
  * Your dependent grandparent, or the dependent grandparent of your spouse 
  * Other direct, dependent descendants or direct, dependent relatives in the ascending line (for example, great grandparents or great grandchildren) of either you or your spouse 

Children over 21 are generally considered qualifying family members if they
are in education, or are dependent on you due to an illness or disability. You
will have to show that your parents or grandparents (or the parents or
grandparents of your spouse) were dependent on you **before** they came to
Ireland.

Other family members may also be given residence. They are **permitted family
members** and include:

  * Your partner 
  * Any relative who is part of your household 
  * Any relative who needs your personal care because of illness or disability 

Other family members have rights of residence based on decisions of the Court
of Justice of the European Union (for example, [ parents of EU citizens
](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-05/cp170048en.pdf)
and [ parents of Irish citizens
](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2011-03/cp110016en.pdf)
).

The residence rights of the non-EU/EEA/Swiss family members may continue
following the death of, or break-up in relationship with, the EU/EEA or Swiss
citizen if certain conditions have been met.

When lawfully resident, those family members are also entitled to work in the
host country. After 5 years of legal residence family members may apply for
permanent residence.
