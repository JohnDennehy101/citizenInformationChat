###  **Orders the court can make based on the reports**

Based on the findings of these reports, the court may decide not to impose a
fine or prison sentence on you.

To reduce the likelihood of you committing further drugs offences, the court
may do one of the following:

  * Place you under the supervision of a named person or body (such as the HSE) for a specified period 
  * Order you to get medical or other treatment that has been recommended for you 
  * Order you to complete education, instruction or training to improve your job prospects and help with your social rehabilitation 
  * Order you to attend a custodial treatment centre (see below) 

If you ignore an order of the court, you can be detained in a custodial
treatment centre or you can be given the usual penalties for your offence,
such as fines or a prison sentence.
