####  **How the system used to work**

Before 1 July 2023, you had to use your personal tax return to account for
your landlordâ€™s tax on rental payments. You could account for it by:

  * Reducing your tax credits and Standard Rate Cut-Off Point, if you paid tax under PAYE 
  * Including the details of your rent on your annual return, if you paid tax under self-assessment 

Then at the end of the year, you had to give your landlord a completed [
Certificate of Income Tax Deducted - Form R185 (pdf).
