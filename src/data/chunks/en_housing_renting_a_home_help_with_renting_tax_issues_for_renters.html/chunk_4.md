###  **Who can get the Rent Tax** **Credit?**

The tax credit is available for rent you have paid for:

  * Your home 
  * A second home you use to take part in an approved course or your work 
  * A property your child uses so they can take part in an approved course. This only applies if your child is under 23 at the start of their first year. 

To claim the credit your tenancy must be registered with the [ Residential
Tenancies Board (RTB) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-
a-home/resolving-disputes/residential-tenancies-board/) , unless you have a [
licence arrangement ](https://www.rtb.ie/register-a-tenancy/is-your-property-
exempt-from-registration-1) . For example, if you are renting a room in a home
that you share with the owner, you have a licence agreement and this does not
have to be registered with the RTB.

In Budget 2024, it was announced that payments made by parents for digs or
rent-a-room arrangements for their children to attend an approved course will
now also qualify for the Rent Tax Credit. This change will apply
retrospectively for the years 2022 and 2023.

The credit is not available if you are getting housing support, such as the [
Housing Assistance Payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-
renting/housing-assistance-payment/) or [ Rent Supplement
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) .
