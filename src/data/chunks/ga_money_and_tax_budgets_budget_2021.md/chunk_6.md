##  Brexit preparations

The Budget has been prepared on the assumption that there will be no bilateral
trade deal between the UK and EU. This would mean that the UK and the EU will
trade on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms in 2021.

The Budget provides €340 million for [ Brexit measures ](/ga/government-in-
ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/what-is-brexit/) .

Funding will be provided to put in place the controls and checks needed for
agri-food exports to, and imports from, Britain from **1 January 2021** .

Compliance funding will be available to carry out work at ports and airports.
An additional 500 staff will bring the total number of staff to 1,500 for
carrying out checks.

Expenditure of €100 million has been provided to departments for **Brexit
supports** including:

  * €8m for new market surveillance and certification 
  * €15m to help businesses respond to changes to customs and tariffs 
  * €7m to help the food processing industry adapt 
  * €11m for Local Enterprise Offices to work with local businesses 
  * €675,000 for InterTrade Ireland to provide practical help to businesses trading cross-border 

A **new Recovery Fund of €3.4 billion** will allow for specific measures in
response to Brexit and COVID-19 to be introduced as needed. It will focus on
three main areas: infrastructure development, reskilling and retraining,
supporting investment and jobs. This fund will be held in reserve and allows
for flexibility, especially for Brexit provisions where there is still
uncertainly around the outcome of negotiations
