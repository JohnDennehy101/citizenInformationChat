###  VRT

**VRT on category A vehicles** (cars and SUVs) will be calculated based on
their CO2 emissions. These will be measured according to the WLTP system. New
VRT rates will apply too and will be published by Revenue in the coming days.

The **nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions-based surcharge** introduced in Budget
2020 has been adjusted. The band has been changed to ensure that vehicles
emitting higher levels of NOx levels will pay more.

The **VRT relief for hybrid (and plug-in hybrid) vehicles** will expire on 31
December 2020 and there will be tapered relief for battery vehicles.

The €5,000 **relief for electric vehicles (EVs)** will be kept in full for all
EVs with an open market selling price of up to €40,000. Above €40,000, the
relief will be reduced and there will be no relief for vehicles with an open
market selling price over €50,000.
