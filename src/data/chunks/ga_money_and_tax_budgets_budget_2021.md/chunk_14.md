###  Debt warehousing for self-assessed taxpayers

The **tax debt warehousing scheme** will be extended to taxpayers who self-
assess for income tax that are adversely impacted by Covid-19. Impacted
taxpayers who cannot pay their 2019 balance and preliminary tax for 2020 can
defer payment for 12 months. If income for 2021 is also at least 25% lower
than income for 2019, the balance of 2020 balance and 2021 Preliminary Tax can
also be warehoused. Debts that are warehoused are subject to 0% interest for
12 months. After this 12-month period, a reduced interest rate of 3% per annum
will apply and no surcharge will apply.
