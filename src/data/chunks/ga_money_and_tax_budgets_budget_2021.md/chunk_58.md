###  Stamp duty

There will be changes to the **Stamp Duty Residential Development Refund
Scheme** , which is due to expire on 31 December 2021. The scheme allows for a
refund on a portion of the Stamp Duty you paid for non-residential
(agricultural) land, where you subsequently develop the land for residential
use.
