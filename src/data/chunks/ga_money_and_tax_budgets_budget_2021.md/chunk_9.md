###  Universal Social Charge (USC)

The ceiling of the 2% band will increase from €20,484 to €20,687, so that the
salary of a full-time worker on the minimum wage will remain outside the
higher rates of [ USC ](/ga/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-
charge/) .

The weekly income threshold for the **higher rate of employer’s PRSI** will
increase from €394 to €398 to ensure that there is no incentive to reduce the
working hours for a full-time employee on the increased minimum wage.

Medical card holders will continue to pay a reduced rate of USC until the end
of December 2021.
