###  If you have any additional income

If you have any additional income, for example, from part-time work, it will
not affect your CE payment. However, the rules on change of circumstances that
apply to your original social welfare payment also apply to your CE payment.
For example, if your qualified adult gets a job, their income will be assessed
as means and your CE payment may be reduced. However, your CE payment cannot
be reduced below the current minimum rate of â‚¬259.50

In order to avoid any possible overpayments, if there is any change in your
circumstances, you should immediately inform your CE supervisor and the local
DSP Community Development Officer responsible for your CE scheme. (Your CE
supervisor will give you contact details for the local DSP Community
Development Officer.) There is more information about change of circumstances
in section 3.2.6 of the [ Community Employment Procedures Manual (pdf)
