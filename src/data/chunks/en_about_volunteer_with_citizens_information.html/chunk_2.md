##  Volunteer with Citizens Information

Join the team of volunteers who support staff within the Citizens Information
Service to provide information, advice and advocacy to the public. Citizens
Information Services help thousands of people on a range of topics including
social welfare, employment rights, housing and immigration.

If you enjoy meeting people, would like to work as part of a team, and believe
that you can explain services and entitlements to the public in simple
language, then volunteering in your local CIS might be the right fit for you!
