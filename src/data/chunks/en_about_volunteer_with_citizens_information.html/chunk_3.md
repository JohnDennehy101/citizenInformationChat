##  What is the Citizens Information Service?

Citizens Information Services (CISs) provide face-to-face services to the
public. Through trained staff and volunteers, CISs provide free, impartial and
confidential information, advice and advocacy services to the public.

Each Citizens Information Service covers a geographical area and delivers the
service through a network of Citizen Information Centres (CICs). There are
eight individual regional Citizens Information Services which are companies
limited by guarantee and are registered charities.

They cover the following areas: North Dublin, Dublin South, North Connacht and
Ulster, North Leinster, North Munster, South Connacht, South Leinster and
South Munster facilitating both rural and urban areas.

CISs provide information on various topics, including;

  * Employment rights 
  * Income support 
  * Social welfare 
  * Family matters 
  * Health services 
  * Housing 
  * Education 
  * Immigration 

Data on the type of information and advice looked for, the range of queries
and concerns raised by the public, and the top information categories and
trends arising each year can be found on the Citizens Information Board's [
DataHub ](https://www.citizensinformationboard.ie/en/data-hub/) .
