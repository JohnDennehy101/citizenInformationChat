####  Mediation at the WRC

In some cases, the WRC may refer your equal pay claim for mediation. When this
happens, a mediation officer will speak to both parties involved and help you
come to an agreed resolution. The mediation officer will record the resolution
in writing, and give it to the Director General of the WRC. The terms of the
resolution are confidential and legally binding on you and the other person.
