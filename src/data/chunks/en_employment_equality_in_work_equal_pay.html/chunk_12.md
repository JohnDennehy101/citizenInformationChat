####  Bring a claim to the WRC

The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) investigates or mediates claims of
unlawful discrimination under equality legislation.

You can bring an equal pay claim using the WRC's [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint/)
. There is no time limit for equal pay claims under equality legislation, so
the general limitation period under the Statute of Limitation on breach of
contract applies. This means you must make a claim within 6 years of the
disparity in pay.

The WRC can award an order that you receive equal pay plus up to 3 years pay
arrears before the complaint was made.
