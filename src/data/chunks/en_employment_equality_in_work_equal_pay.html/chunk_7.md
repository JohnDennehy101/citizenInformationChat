###  Resolution of pay disputes

The Code sets out that you should raise a complaint if you think you are not
being paid equal pay for their like work. This should be done internally at
first before proceeding if necessary to the Workplace Relations Commission or
Courts. See more on ‘Making a claim for equal pay’ below.
