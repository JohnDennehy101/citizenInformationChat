##  What pay is covered?

The general phrase ‘pay’ is used to cover _remuneration_ , which is broader
than pay.

Remuneration is any payment, whether cash or otherwise, that you receive
either directly or indirectly from your employer in respect of your
employment.

Remuneration includes allowances, bonuses, performance payments and non-cash
benefits, for example cars and mobile phones.
