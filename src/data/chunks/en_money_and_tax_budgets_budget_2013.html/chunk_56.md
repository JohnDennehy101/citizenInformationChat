####  Credit initiatives and funding

The following credit specific initiatives have been announced:

  * Approval to the Credit Review Office (CRO) to extend the team of available reviewers so that SMEs seeking assistance from the CRO receive a considered and timely response to their application 
  * The publication by the CRO of specific guidance for SMEs on accessing credit from banks 
  * The National Pensions Reserve Fund is also developing a range of support funds to provide equity, finance and restructuring and recovery investment to the SME sector. The funds are expected to range in size from €100 million to €400 million 

Provision has been made within Enterprise Ireland for the development of a new
ten-year €175 million Venture Capital Fund to fund new and expanding Irish
companies.

County Enterprise Boards are being restructured to provide a One-Stop-Shop for
small businesses through the local authority system. This reform will be
supported with an allocation of over €26 million in 2013, which will
facilitate this transition and fund schemes to support small businesses across
the economy.
