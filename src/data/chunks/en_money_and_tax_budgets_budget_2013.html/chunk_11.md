####  Voluntary deferrals

People with gross incomes of up to €15,000 (single) and €25,000 (couples) can
defer the full LPT until their financial circumstances improve or the property
is sold.

Certain deferral arrangements are also available for people at higher levels
of income, and for people whose income is less than a certain percentage of
their annual mortgage interest.

Some owner-occupiers may be eligible to apply for marginal relief, which will
allow them to defer up to 50% of their LPT liability.

Interest will be charged on deferred amounts at a rate of 4% per annum.
