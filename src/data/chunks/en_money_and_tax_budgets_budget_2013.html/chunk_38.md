####  **State Pension (Contributory)**

There will be changes to the definition of ‘yearly average’ and ‘alternative
yearly average’ to enable rounding of figures. The increase in the number of
qualifying contributions required (from 260 to 520) will now also apply to
people getting reduced rate pensions on or after 1 January 2013.

Special pro-rata pensions for people with intermittent insurance (paid to
people who had problems meeting yearly average requirements because they were
not compulsorily insured before 1974) are being abolished.
