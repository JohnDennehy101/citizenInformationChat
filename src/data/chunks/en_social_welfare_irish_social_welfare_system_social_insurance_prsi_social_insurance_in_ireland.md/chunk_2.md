##  Introduction

Most employers and employees (over 16 years of age) pay social insurance
(PRSI) contributions into the national Social Insurance Fund. In general, the
payment of social insurance is compulsory. The term â€˜insurable employment is
used to describe employment that is liable for social insurance contributions.
Some people who have unearned income are also liable for PRSI.

The Social Insurance Fund is made up of a current account and an investment
account managed by the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for
Finance, respectively. The current account consists of monies collected from
people in employment. This money is then used to fund social insurance
payments. The investment account is a savings account that is managed by the
Minister for Finance. The [ Comptroller and Auditor General ](/en/government-
in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/comptroller-and-
auditor-general/) is responsible for ensuring that the accounts are kept in
order and reports are made to the [ Houses of the Oireachtas
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/houses_of_the_oireachtas/)
.
