##  Work and social insurance

If you are in employment, the amount of social insurance you pay depends on
your earnings and the type of work you do. Your social insurance contributions
in Ireland are referred to as PRSI (Pay Related Social Insurance). Sometimes,
you will hear people describe their PRSI contributions as stamps. This term
dated from before 1979 when employers would literally stamp a card each week
of employment. That card was then brought to a social welfare local office
when claiming social welfare payments.

If you are an employee, your PRSI contributions are deducted by your employer
and collected by Revenue under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system. In fact, the
law makes your employer responsible for PRSI, though you may have to pay an
'employee's share'. [ Find out more about paying social insurance

If you are self-employed, you pay [ Class S social insurance contributions
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/class-
s-prsi/) directly to the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners then
pay the money into the Social Insurance Fund. Revenue send a record of the
contributions you have paid to the Department of Social Protection.

You are not liable for PRSI contributions after the age of 70 - this is the
case whether or not you are employed or self-employed. If you do not have
enough contributions at age 70, you cannot add to them after that.
