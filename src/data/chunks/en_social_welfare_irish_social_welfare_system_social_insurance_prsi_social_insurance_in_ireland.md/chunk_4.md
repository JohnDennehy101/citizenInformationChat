###  COVID-19 payments

If you got a COVID-19 payment – either the [ COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment
Payment ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/covid19-pandemic-unemployment-
payment/) or Revenue’s wage subsidy schemes (including the [ Employment Wage
Subsidy Scheme ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-wage-
subsidy-scheme/) and the Employer COVID-19 Refund Scheme) – you will be
awarded PRSI contributions at the class you were paying immediately before you
were laid off, while you were getting the COVID-19 payment or scheme.
