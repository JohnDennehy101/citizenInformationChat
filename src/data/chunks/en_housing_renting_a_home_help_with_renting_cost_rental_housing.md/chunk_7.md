##  What happens if my application is successful?

If your application is successful, the organisation administering the scheme
will contact you to let you know.

You will be asked to pay a deposit of one month’s rent minus €50. You will
then be asked to sign Tenancy Agreement and will be given a move-in date.

Cost rental homes do not come furnished. So, you will have to get your own
furniture for your home. However, some items may be included already, such as:

  * White goods (like a fridge-freezer, dishwasher, oven and hob, microwave, washer-dryer) 
  * Blinds 
  * Flooring 

You will also need to set up utilities yourself, such as:

  * Electricity 
  * Internet 
  * Telephone
