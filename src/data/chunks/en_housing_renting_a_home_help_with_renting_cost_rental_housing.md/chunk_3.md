##  How does cost rental work?

In cost rental homes, the rent is based on how much building, managing and
maintaining the property will cost. This cost is calculated over a minimum of
40 years and the rents must be at least 25% below private market rents in the
area.

Rents are linked to annual inflation, so any rent increases will be in-line
with inflation.

Tenants have greater security of tenure in cost rental homes, making renting a
long-term option.

Cost rental homes are delivered by approved housing bodies (AHBâ€™s), local
authorities and the Land Development Agency (LDA). The local authorities and
approved housing bodies apply for government funding and grants to help cover
the cost of building or buying these homes.
