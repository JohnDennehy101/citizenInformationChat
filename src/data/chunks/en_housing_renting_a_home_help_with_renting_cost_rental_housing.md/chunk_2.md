##  What is cost rental housing?

Cost rental housing provides affordable rented accommodation to people on
middle incomes. It is aimed at people who are above the threshold for social
housing but have difficulty affording private rented accommodation.

It is called ‘cost rental’ because the rent you pay is based on the cost of
building, managing and maintaining the homes. It does not include any profit
for a developer. This makes the rent cheaper than standard rents. The rent for
cost rental homes must be at least 25% below regular market rents in an area.

Cost rental homes are delivered by approved housing bodies (AHB’s), local
authorities and the Land Development Agency (LDA). They provide long-term [
security of tenure ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-and-
responsibilities/types-of-tenancy/) , so people can rent the same home
indefinitely.

The Government aims to deliver 18,000 cost-rental homes by 2030. This is
outlined in the [ Housing for All ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ef5ec-
housing-for-all-a-new-housing-plan-for-ireland/) plan, which sets out the
housing plan for Ireland to 2030.
