Usually, if you receive a summons to court and you get legal advice, your
solicitor will check the dates on the [ summons ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/summons/) to make sure that the Garda applied for it within
the time limit allowed. If the Gardaí applied for was made outside the time
limit, then the prosecution will be dismissed in court.

**Date the Gardaí make** **a complaint or application**

The important date is when the Gardaí make the complaint to the District Court
judge or the date they make the application to the appropriate court clerk to
issue a [ summons ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/summons/) . The date the summons was issued on or the date
on which the summons was served on you are not important for this purpose.

**Date of the offence**

The other important date is what date the offence took place. In most cases
this is usually very clear, such as in a case of speeding or theft.

However, the dates for certain offences are slightly different.

For example, if you are stopped by the Gardaí while driving on 1 January and
you are asked to show your motor insurance certificate. If you do not show it
there and then, you have the next 10 days to show it at a Garda station of
your choice.

If you fail to show within 10 days, then you have committed an offence. The
offence date does not start until **after** the 10 days have expired and the
date you were stopped does not count as one of the 10 days. Therefore, in this
case, 12 January would be the date from which a prosecution can be brought.
