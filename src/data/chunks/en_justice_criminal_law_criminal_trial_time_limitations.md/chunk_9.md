###  Special time limits

The general time limit of 6 months for starting proceedings, applies to most
offences which are dealt with in the District Court. However, there are some
exceptions to this.

Because of the nature and difficulty of investigating some offences and of
gathering enough evidence to start proceedings, special time limits are
applied to them by law.

Examples of these offences include the following:

  * Getting car insurance by fraud or by knowingly making a false statement (any proceedings need not start until 3 months after the garda√≠ have sufficient evidence subject to a maximum time limit of 3 years) 
  * For offences under the Customs Acts, any proceedings must start within 2 years from the date of the offence. 
  * For offences under the Revenue Acts, any proceedings must start within 10 years from the date of the offence. This does not cover the actual repayment of any unpaid tax, which is a separate matter.
