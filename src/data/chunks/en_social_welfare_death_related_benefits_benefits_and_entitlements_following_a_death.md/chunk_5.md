###  Additional payments

Bereavement can cause financial difficulties. The [ Supplementary Welfare
Allowance Scheme ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/) provides
financial support to people with low incomes. You may qualify for a weekly
supplement payment under the scheme to meet certain special needs, for
example, help with rent and fuel costs. In addition, payments can also be made
for urgent or exceptional needs.

There are specific rules about taxation in the year of a person's death, for
example, a tax refund may be due. There are also extra credits for parents in
the years following the death of a spouse or civil partner. [ Find out more
