###  Help with funeral costs

You can get help with the cost of the funeral:

  * The [ Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner Grant ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/widowed-parents-bereavement-grant/) is a once-off payment to widows/widowers/surviving civil partners with dependent children.This payment was formerly called the Widowed Parent Grant. 
  * If someone dies from an accident at work, a [ Funeral Grant ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/special-funeral-grant/) is available. 

Whether you qualify or not for one of the above grants you may be eligible for
an Additional Needs Payment to [ help with funeral costs if you are on a low
income ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/additional-needs-
payment/) . Each case is decided on its merits. The Community Welfare Service
prefers if you apply before the funeral takes place, but in practice, most
people apply afterwards.

In many cases a payment or a grant cannot be paid until all the necessary
documentation is received. If you are claiming the grant, you are responsible
for the production of certificates, documents and any information required,
for example:

  * Death certificate 
  * Birth certificate 
  * Marriage or Civil Partnership certificate (to prove your relationship to the deceased) 
  * Funeral receipts 
  * The deceased person's [ Personal Public Service (PPS) number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/)
  * Your PPS number may also be required
