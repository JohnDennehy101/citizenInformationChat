##  Remote hearings in civil cases

The Act allows the President of the relevant Court to designate categories of
civil case for hearing remotely. In addition, a party can ask or the judge can
decide to hear part or all of any case remotely. However, where a remote
hearing is decided by a judge to be unfair to any of the parties or contrary
to the interests of justice, the decision to hear it remotely will not apply.

Those taking part in remote hearings will continue to benefit from the same
protections as if they were in physical attendance in court and the court will
have the same powers.

It is an offence to frustrate the participation of any person in a remote
hearing or to interfere with the technology being used. It is also an offence
to make any recording of the proceedings.

Penalties include a maximum fine of €5,000, 12 months’ imprisonment or both,
if convicted in the District Court, or a maximum fine of €50,000, 3 years’
imprisonment or both, if convicted in a higher court.
