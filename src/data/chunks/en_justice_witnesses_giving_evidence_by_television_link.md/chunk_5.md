##  Remote hearing of criminal appeals

The Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court now have the power to direct that
any criminal appeal before it be held remotely. Again, where a remote hearing
is unfair to any of the parties or contrary to the interests of justice, the
decision to hear it remotely will not apply.

Similarly, it is an offence to interfere with the participation of any person
in a remote appeal or to interfere with the technology being used. It is also
an offence to make any recording of the proceedings.

Penalties include a maximum fine of €5,000, 12 months’ imprisonment or both,
if convicted in the District Court or a maximum fine of €50,000, 3 years’
imprisonment or both, if convicted in a higher court.
