##  What is the Telephone Support Allowance?

The Telephone Support Allowance (TSA) is an extra weekly payment for people on
certain social welfare payments who are also getting both the Living Alone
Increase and the Fuel Allowance.

It can help people living alone with the cost of communications or a home
alert system.

You do not need to apply for Telephone Support Allowance because it is paid
automatically to people who qualify. It is paid with your main weekly social
welfare payment.
