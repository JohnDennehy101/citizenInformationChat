##  What happens to my income supports?

If you are unemployed you may be able to keep your medical card or Rent
Supplement when you take up employment - see below. If you have been
unemployed for some time and still have not found a job you may be eligible
for an [ employment scheme. ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/) There are also [ employment supports
for people with disabilities. ](/en/employment/employment-and-disability/)

**If you have children:**

  * If you are taking up a low-paid job, you may qualify for [ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/)
  * The [ Back to Work Family Dividend ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/back-to-work-family-dividend/) is available for lone parent and long-term jobseeker families with children return to work. It can be paid in addition to WFP. 
  * A number of [ affordable childcare schemes ](/en/education/pre-school-education-and-childcare/your-childcare-options/) provide childcare for families on lower incomes and aim to support parents to return to work or education.
