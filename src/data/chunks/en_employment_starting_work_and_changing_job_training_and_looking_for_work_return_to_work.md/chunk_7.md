###  Tax  

Your new employer must deduct tax and [ the Universal Social Charge (USC)
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) from your pay
under the PAYE system from the beginning of your employment. To make sure that
your tax is properly dealt with from the start and that your employer deducts
the right amount of tax from your pay, you should:

  * Give your employer your [ Personal Public Service (PPS) number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) and ask for your Employer's Registered Number. If you do not know your PPS number, contact your Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office and staff there can find your number for you. 
  * Register the details of your new job with [ Revenue’s Jobs and Pensions online service ](http://www.revenue.ie/en/online/jobs-pensions.html) in [ myAccount ](https://www.ros.ie/myaccount-web/home.html) . If you are unable to use online services, you can contact your tax office for assistance – see ‘Where to apply’ below. 

Ideally you should take these steps as soon as you accept an offer of a job,
even if only a part-time or holiday employment. This will give your employer
and Revenue time to get things sorted out before your first pay day.

When you have registered the details of your new job, Revenue will send a
Revenue payroll notification (RPN) to your new employer. The RPN will tell
your employer how much income tax and universal Social Charge (USC) to deduct
from your pay. You can view your tax credit certificate and claim any
additional tax credits you may be due through Revenue's PAYE Services. You
access PAYE Services through Revenue's myAccount.

If you have not sorted out your tax position by the time you start work your
employer will have to [ deduct tax on an emergency basis
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/jobs-and-pensions/emergency-tax/index.aspx) _._
