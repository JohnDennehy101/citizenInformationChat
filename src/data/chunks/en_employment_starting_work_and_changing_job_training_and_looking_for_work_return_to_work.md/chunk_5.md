###  **Differential rents and returning to work**

If you are renting from a [ local authority ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-
government-works/local-and-regional-government/functions-of-local-
authorities/) or [ housing association ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-
social-housing/approved-housing-bodies/) , your rent is calculated using the
local authority differential rents system. This system is based on your
householdâ€™s weekly income and your ability to pay. So, if your income
increases when you return to work, you must tell the local authority or
housing association and you can be asked for a higher contribution towards the
rent.

If you are a private tenant on the [ Housing Assistance Payment
](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/)
(HAP) scheme, your rent contribution is calculated in a similar way and you
will have to notify the local authority when your income changes.
