###  PRSI  

Providing your employer with your PPS number will allow your social welfare
contributions to be recorded along with any contributions you paid in previous
periods of employment.

If you have been out of the workforce for some years, you will not immediately
qualify for short-term social welfare payments such as [ Illness Benefit
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/illness-benefit/) . You are,
however, immediately covered for Injury Benefit, where you are unable to work
due to an accident at work. How quickly you will qualify for the various
social welfare benefits will depend on the type of benefit you are applying
for and your circumstances before returning to work. You gain [ credited
contributions ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/) if, for example, you
are sick or unemployed.
