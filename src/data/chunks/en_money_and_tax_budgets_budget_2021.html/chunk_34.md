####  COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS)

A new **COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS)** has been set up, aimed at
businesses impacted by Covid-19 restrictions.

Qualifying businesses can apply to Revenue for a cash payment. The maximum
weekly payment will be €5,000. The scheme is aimed at those in the
accommodation, food and arts, recreation and entertainment sectors. If the
Government decides to move to a higher level of restrictions then other
sectors may qualify.

The scheme will run from 13 October 2020 until 31 March 2021.

The following measures will apply:

  * Payments will be made when Level 3 restrictions or higher are in place in line with the Plan for Living with COVID-19 
  * Businesses will qualify where government restrictions directly prohibit or restrict customer access to their premises 
  * Payments will be calculated on the basis of 10% of the first €1 million in turnover and 5% thereafter, based on average VAT exclusive turnover for 2019 
  * A self- assessment of 80% disruption in turnover will be required
