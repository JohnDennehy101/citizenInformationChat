##  Visiting teachers for deaf children

Visiting teachers work with deaf or hard-of-hearing children and provide
guidance and support to their parents or guardians. They monitor the childâ€™s
language development and communication skills, encouraging development of
these through everyday activities, interaction and play.

To support deaf or hard-of-hearing children in mainstream schools (including
pre-schools), visiting teachers can advise schools about:

  * Educational planning 
  * Suitable teaching methods 
  * Classroom management strategies 
  * Recommended assistive technologies 
  * The acoustic environment of the classroom to help hard-of-hearing children
