##  Visiting teachers for blind and visually impaired children

Visiting teachers work with blind and visually impaired children and provide
guidance and support to their parents or guardians. They can assess the
effects of visual impairment and can advise on each childâ€™s needs now and in
the future.

To support students with visual impairments in mainstream schools (including
pre-schools), visiting teachers can advise schools about:

  * Educational planning 
  * Suitable teaching methods 
  * Classroom management strategies 
  * Recommended assistive technologies 
  * Making the environment safer for visually impaired children 

Visiting teachers conduct assessments, give advice on equipment commonly used
by people who are visually impaired, and advise on additional personnel
resources, when needed.
