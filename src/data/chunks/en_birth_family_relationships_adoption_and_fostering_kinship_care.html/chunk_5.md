###  Testamentary guardianship

A guardian can appoint another guardian in their will to take on the
responsibility of their children after their death. The ‘testamentary
guardian’ can then apply to the court for custody of the child. If a
testamentary guardian is appointed and there is another surviving guardian,
both guardians will act jointly with each other and have the right to apply
for custody of the child.
