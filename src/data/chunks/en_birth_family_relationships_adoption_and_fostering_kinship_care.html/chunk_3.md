##  Guardianship

Guardianship is the legal responsibility of a person to perform duties
regarding a child's upbringing and welfare. It also includes the right to make
decisions about major areas of the childâ€™s life.

For example, guardians have a duty to properly care for a child. They also
have rights that may include decisions on:

  * Consent to medical treatment 
  * What school the child attends 
  * Passport applications and taking the child out of the country 
  * The child's religious upbringing 

To apply for custody and/or guardianship, contact your local District Court
Office. When a birth parent is alive, a kinship carer must be caring for a
child for 12 consecutive months before they can become a legal guardian. [
Kinship Care Ireland ](https://www.kinshipcare.ie/) can provide further
information and support on applying for guardianship.
