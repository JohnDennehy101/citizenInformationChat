##  What is kinship care?

In some circumstances, grandparents, other relatives or a family friend may
take on the full-time care of children and young people, when parents are not
able to care for them. Reasons for this include parental drug or alcohol
misuse, imprisonment, abuse or neglect, domestic violence and parental health
issues or parental capacity. Kinship care can also arise from the death of a
parent. Many kinship care arrangements are informal unlike [ relative foster
care ](/en/birth-family-relationships/adoption-and-fostering/fostering/) which
is a formal arrangement.

Depending on how your kinship family is formed there are different routes to
secure your legal relationship with and responsibility for the children and
young people in your care, to ensure that their rights can be exercised and
protected.
