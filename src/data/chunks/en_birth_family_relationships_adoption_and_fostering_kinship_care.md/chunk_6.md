##  Social welfare

You may get social welfare support if a child lives with you and you are
responsible for their care. For example, you may qualify to receive [ Child
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/) and/or [
Guardian's Payment ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-
orphan-payments/) .

[ Child Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/families-and-children/child-benefit/) is
a monthly payment to the parents or guardians of children under 16 years of
age. You can get Child Benefit for children aged 16 and 17, if they are in
full-time education or full-time training, or have a disability and cannot
support themselves. From 1 May 2024, Child Benefit will be extended to
children aged 18 who are in full-time education or who have a disability.

[ Guardian’s Payment ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/guardian-and-
orphan-payments/) is a weekly payment of €215 per week per child to support
meeting the caring needs of a child. You do not need to be a legal guardian to
apply for Guardian’s Payment. If you are a kinship carer who has been refused
Guardian’s Payment, contact Kinship Care Ireland for further information and
support.

[ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) and the [ Additional Needs Payment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/additional-needs-payment/) are means-tested payments that you can
apply for while you are waiting for the processing of your Guardian’s Payment
application.
