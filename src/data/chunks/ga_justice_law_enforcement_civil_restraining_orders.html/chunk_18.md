##  Appealing against a restraining order

You can appeal against a civil restraining order to the [ Circuit Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/)
. You must appeal within 14 days of the order being made. The Circuit Court
may extend the appeal period, but only for good reason.

The civil restraining order remains in force until the outcome of the appeal
unless the District Court or the Circuit Court puts a stay (suspension) on the
order.

During the appeal, the court will re-hear the application for an order. The
Circuit Court can decide to:

  * Make the same order 
  * Make a different order 

or

  * Refuse to make an order.
