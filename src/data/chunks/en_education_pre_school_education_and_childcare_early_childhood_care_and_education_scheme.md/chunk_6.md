###  Children with special needs

The [ **Access and Inclusion Model (AIM)** ](https://aim.gov.ie/) supports
children with disabilities to access the ECCE programme. The model is based on
the needs of the child and does not require a diagnosis of disability.

AIM has 7 levels of support, moving from universal to targeted support
depending on the needs of the child and the pre-school provider. The model
offers tailored, practical supports based on a child’s needs.

All children can access Levels 1 – 3 of the model. These involve a suite of
universal supports which are designed to promote and support an inclusive
culture within pre-school settings by means of educational and capacity-
building initiatives for providers and practitioners.

Where a pre-school service provider, along with the parent, considers that
additional support may be necessary to meet a child’s needs, they can apply
for one or more additional targeted supports under levels 4 – 7 of the model.

Additional targeted supports may include:

  * Expert educational advice and mentoring – Level 4 
  * Specialised equipment, appliances and minor alterations – Level 5 
  * Therapeutic supports – Level 6 
  * Additional capitation to fund extra assistance in the ECCE pre-school room – level 7. 

When you have identified a pre-school for your child, your service provider,
in consultation with you, will consider what supports may be needed to ensure
your child’s participation in pre-school.

Where it is considered that your child needs additional support, your pre-
school service provider can apply, in partnership with you, for targeted
supports under AIM.

The [ AIM website ](https://aim.gov.ie/) provides [ information for parents
](https://aim.gov.ie/parents/) and [ Frequently Asked Questions
](http://www.preschoolaccess.ie/faqs/) on supports available. Your local City
or County Childcare Committee will also be able to provide you with
information and guidance on AIM.
