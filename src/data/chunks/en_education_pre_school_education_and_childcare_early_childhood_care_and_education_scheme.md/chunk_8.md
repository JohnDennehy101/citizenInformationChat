##  How to apply for ECCE

To get a place for your child, apply to a participating playschool or daycare
centre. You can get a list of participating services from your local City or
County Childcare Committee (CCC) – see ‘Where to apply’ below.

You will need to provide a copy of your child's birth certificate or passport
and [ PPS number ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-
public-service-number/) .

**Supports for children with special needs**

If your child needs additional support, your pre-school provider can apply, in
partnership with you, for targeted supports under AIM. Applications are made
through the Programmes Implementation Platform (PIP) on the Pobal website.
Your pre-school service provider will be familiar with the Pobal website and
with PIP.

The application process is open and will remain open throughout the year.

Applications can only be made with your full consent.
