###  How the ECCE scheme is provided

The childcare provider must provide ECCE for 3 hours a day, 5 days a week for
38 weeks a year.

**Sessional services**

If your child attends a half-day or “sessional” service, such as a playschool,
naíonra, Montessori or parent and toddler group, the normal pattern for the
free ECCE scheme school year is 3 hours a day for 5 days a week over the
school year. If your child attends for more than this, you will be charged for
the extra time.

A small number of sessional services that cannot open for 5 days a week
provide 3 hours and 30 minutes a day for 4 days a week over the school year.
This only applies to services which have already been granted permission.

**Daycare services**

For full-time or part-time daycare services, the normal pattern for the free
ECCE scheme is 3 hours per day for 5 days a week. If your child attends for
longer than this each day, you will be charged for the extra time.

**If your child does not attend**

Your child may lose their ECCE place, if they have not attended ECCE for 4
consecutive weeks. In special circumstances, a child can keep their place if
they are absent for more than 4 consecutive weeks. For example, in the case of
a prolonged illness a place can be kept for up to 12 weeks. A place may be
kept for up to 6 weeks in the case of a bereavement.
