###  Renewing a parking card

The parking card must be renewed every 2 years. You will receive a renewal
form several weeks before your parking card is due to expire. So, if you
change your address, you should tell the organisation that gave you the card.

If you have had any surgery or treatment that may have improved your mobility,
you should include this information in the mobility section of the renewal
form.
