###  Travelling abroad

You can use the card when you travel within the EU. Make sure to bring your
card with you.

Remember that you must follow the motoring laws and restrictions on parking
when travelling abroad. The EU Commission has produced a publication, [
Parking card for people with disabilities in the European Union
](http://www.dttas.ie/roads/publications/english/parking-card-people-people-
disabilities-european-union-conditions-membe-0) .

If you are travelling outside the EU, you should contact the embassy for that
country.

Information on using the parking card abroad is available in the [ Fédération
Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Guide for the disabled traveller
](http://www.disabledmotorists.eu/) .
