##  What is the Community Childcare Subvention Plus Saver Programme?

**The Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP) Saver Programme is closed to
new applicants.**

The [ National Childcare Scheme (NCS)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/national-childcare-scheme/) replaced a number of childcare supports,
including the CCSP Saver Programme. If you are already on the CCSP Saver
Programme, you can choose to stay on this as long as you are eligible, or
until you transfer to another scheme.

The [ CCSP Saver Programme
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/48b9a-community-childcare-subvention-plus-
ccsp-saver-
programme/?referrer=https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/48b9a-community-
childcare-subvention-plus-ccsp-and-training-and-employment-childcare-tec-
programme-rules-2020-2021/) helps disadvantaged parents and parents in
training, education or low-paid employment to get childcare at reduced rates.
The subvention is available to children going to a participating [ Tusla
registered childcare service ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/preschool-
services/) .

Parents cannot get the [ Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre-school-education-and-
childcare/early-childhood-care-and-education-scheme/) and a CCSP Saver
Programme fee reduction at the same time. You can decide which scheme is of
greater benefit to you.
