###  **Bathing water quality**

Your local authority tests the water at identified bathing areas every month
during the bathing season, which runs from 1 June to 15 September each year.

Some local authorities test the water more often to make sure it is safe to
swim in. You can see the results of the yearly water quality tests as well as
the tests during the bathing season at or on [ your local authority website
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/942f74-local-authorities/) .

Sometimes, a local authority will restrict swimming in a bathing area because
the water quality is polluted, or the conditions are unsafe.

You should not swim or take part in recreational water activities for at least
48 hours after heavy rainfall to prevent the risk of getting sick.
Contamination of bathing water from sewage can happen after heavy rainfall and
this can make you sick. This 48-hour rule applies even if the local authority
website shows that the water is safe, as the sample used to determine this may
be a few days or weeks old.
