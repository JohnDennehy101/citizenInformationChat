###  **When is it not safe to get into the water?**

  * If you can’t swim 
  * Where there are only red flags 
  * Where there are signs telling you to avoid the water 
  * If there is no lifeguard 
  * If you are swimming alone 
  * In a rip current area 
  * After drinking alcohol or eating food 
  * When it is dark 
  * If you see or hear a storm 

**Rip currents** are dangerous parts of water that can bring you out to sea
very quickly. A rip current often looks like an area of darker water and if
there are waves, they will break on either side, but not directly in the rip.
If you find yourself caught in a rip current, remain calm, swim parallel to
the beach and do not try to swim against the current. If you can’t do this,
raise your arm and shout for a lifeguard. [ Read more about rip currents
