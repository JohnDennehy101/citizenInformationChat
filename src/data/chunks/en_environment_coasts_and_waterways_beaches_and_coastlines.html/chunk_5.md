###  **Safe sea swimming**

Drowning is a real danger even if you know how to swim. It is important to
learn how to swim before going into the sea. You should also follow some of
these tips for safe sea swimming:

  * Don’t swim alone 
  * Don’t swim just after eating 
  * Don’t swim when you’re tired 
  * Swim parallel and close to the shore 
  * Do what the lifeguard tells you 
  * Obey the signs and flags on the beach 

Also, remember that it is much more dangerous if you are sea swimming in the
winter than in the summer.

If you find yourself in the water unexpectedly or get into difficulty, you
should try to float by following the [ Float to Live steps
](https://rnli.org/safety/float) .

If you see someone in difficulty in the sea:

  1. Call for help - dial 112 and ask for the coast guard or shout for a lifeguard 
  2. Throw them something that floats like a ringbouy that they can hold onto 
  3. Do not go into the water yourself. Too many people drown trying to save others.
