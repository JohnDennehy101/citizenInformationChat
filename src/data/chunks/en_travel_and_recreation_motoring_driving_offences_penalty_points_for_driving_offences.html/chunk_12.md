###  Penalty points from other jurisdictions

Penalty points from other countries (including EU/EEA member states and the
United Kingdom) are not recognised between states. Although a European
Convention on driving disqualifications was signed by the member states in
June 1998, it is not currently in force. However, the UK and Ireland have a [
separate agreement ](https://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Licensed-Drivers/Driving-
licence/Mutual-recognition-of-Driver-Disqualifications/) that allows each
country to recognise disqualifications (but not penalty points) due to certain
offences.
