###  Universal Social Charge, PRSI and VAT

**USC:** You must pay the [ Universal Social Charge (USC) ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/universal-social-charge/) if your gross income is over
€13,000 in a year.

An extra charge of 3% applies to any self-employed income over €100,000. This
means that self-employed people pay a total of 11% USC on any income over
€100,000. The USC does not apply to social welfare or similar payments. You
pay your USC with your preliminary tax payment.

**PRSI:** Self-employed people pay [ Class S PRSI ](/en/social-welfare/irish-
social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/class-s-prsi/) on their income.
