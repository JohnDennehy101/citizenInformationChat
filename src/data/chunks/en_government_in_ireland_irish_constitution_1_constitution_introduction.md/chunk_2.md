##  Introduction

The Irish Constitution (or Bunreacht na h√âireann) was ratified by the Irish
people in 1937. It is the fundamental law of the State.

Every part of the Constitution is set out in both the Irish and English
languages. [ Article 8
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part2) states that the
Irish language is the first official language and that the English language is
recognised as a second official language.

The Constitution establishes the branches or [ organs of government
](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/main-institutions-of-the-
state/) , it establishes the courts and sets out how those institutions should
be run. It also describes the [ fundamental rights ](/en/government-in-
ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-fundamental-rights/) of every Irish
citizen.

The Constitution is also part of a wider _human rights framework_ in Ireland.
This refers to all legal and other human rights commitments made by Ireland,
including treaties under the [ United Nations
](http://www.un.org/en/index.html) , the European Convention on Human Rights
and the [ Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-law/charter-of-fundamental-
rights/) .
