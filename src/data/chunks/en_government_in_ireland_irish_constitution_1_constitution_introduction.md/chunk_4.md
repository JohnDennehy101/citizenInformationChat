##  The Constitution and legislation

One of the most important Articles of the Constitution is [ Article 15.4
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part4) , which states that
the Oireachtas must not enact any law that is _repugnant_ to the Constitution
(conflicts with the Constitution). This means that the Constitution is
superior to all other law.

If any element of an existing law is found to be repugnant to the
Constitution, that element of the law is invalid (Article 15.4.2).

If a proposed new law would be repugnant to the Constitution, it cannot be
enacted unless the Constitution has been amended accordingly â€“ see 'Amending
the Constitution' below.

[ Article 25 ](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article20)
provides that Bills passed by both houses of the Oireachtas should be
presented to the President for signature. Once a Bill has been signed by the
President, it becomes law. However, Article 26 provides that the President may
refer the Bill to the Supreme Court to decide if it is [ repugnant to the
Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-
accountability/unconstitutional-legislation-and-decisions/) . The President
will not sign the Bill into law if the Supreme Court decides against it.

Every law that is enacted is presumed to be constitutional until it is proven
not to be. The High Court has the power or jurisdiction to cancel any law or
part of any law that is repugnant to the Constitution.
