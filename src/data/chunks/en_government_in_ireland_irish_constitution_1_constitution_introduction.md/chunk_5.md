##  Amending the Constitution

The consent of the Irish people is needed before the Constitution can be
amended. This means that amendments to the Constitution can only be made by
way of a [ constitutional referendum ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-
and-referenda/types-of-elections-and-referendums/constitutional-referendum-in-
ireland/) . To date, 40 constitutional referendums have been held, of which 32
resulted in amendments to the Constitution. A [ list of the amending Acts
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/) is at the front of the
Constitution published on irishstatutebook.ie.

If no petition challenging the result is presented to the High Court within 7
days of its publication, the certificate becomes final. The President will
then sign the Bill to change the Constitution and the Constitution will be
amended.
