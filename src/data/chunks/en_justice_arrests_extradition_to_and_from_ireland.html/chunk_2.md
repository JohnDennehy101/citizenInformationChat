##  Introduction

Extradition is the transfer of a person from one country to another so they
can be prosecuted or punished for an offence they have been convicted of.

Extradition is usually only possible if there is an extradition agreement
between the two countries in question.

So, Ireland must have an agreement with the other country before someone can
be extradited to or from Ireland.

Each country has specific rules about extradition. For example, Ireland does
not allow extradition for the purposes of investigation of a criminal offence
only.

Since 2004, extradition between EU member states has been governed by the [
European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32002F0584) . This has been implemented in Ireland
by the [ European Arrest Warrant Act 2003
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2003/en/act/pub/0045/index.html) and [ 2012
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/act/30/enacted/en/html) and [ 2024
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2024/act/9/section/29/enacted/en/html) .

Extradition to other countries from Ireland is governed by the [ Extradition
Act 1965 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1965/en/act/pub/0017/index.html) as
amended.
