###  Dual criminality for European Arrest Warrants

Dual criminality is when there are similar offences under the laws of both
states. Until January 2004, dual criminality was required for all offences if
you were to be extradited.

Since January 2024, dual criminality is not needed for extradition between EU
member states if you have committed certain major offences which are listed in
the European Arrest Warrants Act 2003 including:

  * Participation in a criminal organisation 
  * Terrorism 
  * Trafficking in human beings 
  * Sexual exploitation of children and child pornography 
  * Trafficking in arms 
  * Ammunition and explosives 
  * Corruption, fraud, money laundering and counterfeiting of money. 

If the offence is serious enough and punishable by at least 3 years'
imprisonment in the member state that has issued the warrant, then the
arresting state must execute the European Arrest Warrant for the above listed
crimes even if the definition of the offence is not the same.

The dual criminality requirement remains for all other offences.
