##  Extradition to and from the UK

When the United Kingdom left the European Union, this meant some of the laws
that were used for extradition between the UK and Ireland stopped applying.

**If you were validly arrested under a European Arrest Warrant before** **11pm
on 31 December 2020** , the European Arrest Warrant regime applies to your
extradition to the UK.

**If you have been arrested for extradition since 11pm on 31 December 2020** ,
the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement continues to allow extradition to
Ireland from the UK and vice versa. This agreement contains similar
extradition rules and procedures to the European Arrest Warrant regime. This
also applies to **pre-31 December 2020** requests for extradition when the
person had not been arrested at that time.
