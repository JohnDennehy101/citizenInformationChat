####  **Irish language requirement (ILR)**

Be aware that if you successfully register as a primary teacher, you will
normally have the [ Irish Language Requirement (ILR)
](https://www.teachingcouncil.ie/register/registration-with-conditions/irish-
language-requirement-ilr/) condition applied to your registration. This is
because primary school teachers in Ireland must be able to teach the Irish
language and the range of primary school subjects in Irish.

The Teaching Council has a page that explains [ how you can complete the ILR
](https://www.teachingcouncil.ie/register/registration-with-conditions/irish-
language-requirement-ilr/) .
