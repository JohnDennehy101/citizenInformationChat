##  Introduction

If youâ€™re a teacher returning to Ireland who qualified outside Ireland and
want to teach at a primary or post-primary school and receive a state salary,
you will need to apply for recognition of your qualifications.

[ The Teaching Council ](https://www.teachingcouncil.ie/) is the professional
organisation that regulates the teaching profession in Ireland and will assess
your foreign teaching qualifications. They produce a [ code of professional
conduct for teachers ](https://www.teachingcouncil.ie/fitness-to-
teach/updated-code-of-professional-conduct/) , which covers standards of
teaching, knowledge, skill, and competence. They also maintain a register of
teachers.

Below, you will find information about the qualifications needed to be a
teacher in Irish primary and post-primary schools, as well as an explanation
of the assessment and registration process if you qualified outside Ireland.
