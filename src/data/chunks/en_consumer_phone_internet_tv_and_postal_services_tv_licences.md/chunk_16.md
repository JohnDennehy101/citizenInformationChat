##  If you don’t pay your TV licence

If you have not paid your TV licence, you can get a notice from An Post to
warn you that you could be prosecuted if you don't buy a TV licence.

A TV licence inspector can visit your home to check if you have a TV.

If you don't have a TV licence to show the inspector, you could face a court
appearance. If convicted, you could be fined €1,000 for a first offence and
€2,000 for subsequent offences.

If you have been fined and you breach court orders directing you to pay their
television licence, you can be imprisoned.

If you receive a TV licence notice but do not have a TV in your home or
business premises, you should fill out [ Statutory Declaration Form (PDF)
](https://www.tvlicence.ie/home/pdfs/StatutoryDeclaration.pdf) and return it
to your local [ TV Licence Records Office
](https://www.tvlicence.ie/home/records-office.html) .
