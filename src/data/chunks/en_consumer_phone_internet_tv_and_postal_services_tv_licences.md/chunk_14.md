##  Where can I find my TV licence number?

Your TV licence number (or TV reference number) is a 17 digit number [ shown
on your renewal notice ](https://www.tvlicence.ie/RefNoPin.htm) , together
with your 5 digit PIN.

If you donâ€™t have these details, you need to write to or email your [ local TV
Records office ](https://www.tvlicence.ie/home/records-office.html) . You will
get a new PIN each year.
