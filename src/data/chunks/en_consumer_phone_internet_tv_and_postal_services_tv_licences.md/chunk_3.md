##  Do I need a TV licence?

If you have a TV, you must have a TV licence. This applies even if the TV is
broken, as it is capable of being fixed. If you have other equipment capable
of receiving TV signals (for example by using an aerial, satellite dish or
cable), you must also have a TV licence.

You only need one TV licence for your whole house, even if you have multiple
TVs in your home.

If you are living in an apartment or flat and have a TV, you need your own TV
licence. A separate licence is required for each separate flat or apartment.
