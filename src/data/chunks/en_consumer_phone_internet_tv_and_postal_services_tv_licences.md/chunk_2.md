##  Introduction

If you have a TV, you must have a TV licence.

A TV licence costs €160 a year for both homes and businesses. If you are over
70, you are entitled to a free TV licence under the Household Benefits
package.

You can be fined up to €1,000 (or €2,000 for subsequent offences) if you do
not have a TV licence when you need one.
