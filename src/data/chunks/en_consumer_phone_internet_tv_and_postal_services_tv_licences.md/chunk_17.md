is the designated body, under the [ Broadcasting Act 2009
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/18/enacted/en/print#sec140) ,
that issues TV licences and collects fees on behalf of the [ Department of
Communications, Climate Action and Environment ](https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-
ie/Pages/default.aspx) . The Department pays a commission from TV licence fee
receipts to An Post for this work.

7% of revenue from the TV licence fees is paid to the Broadcasting Authority
of Ireland (BAI) for the Broadcasting Fund. It is used to support the
production of programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience and
programmes to improve adult literacy.

The remaining revenue (approximately 85%) from TV licence fees goes to RTÃ‰ to
carry out its public service broadcasting commitments.
