If you are moving house, you can transfer your TV licence to your new address.

Bring your licence to your nearest An Post office, with evidence of your new
address (for example a household utility bill or a bank statement). An Post
will update your details and reissue the licence for free.

You can also go online to [ update your TV licence records

licence number and PIN.

You can change other personal details in the same way - either online or at
your nearest An Post office.

Your change of address or other personal details will be updated on the TV
licence database within 10 working days.
