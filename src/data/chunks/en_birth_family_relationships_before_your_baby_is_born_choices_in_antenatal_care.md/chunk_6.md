##  Private care

Private care is available in all maternity hospitals in Ireland. You will have
a particular obstetrician that will provide your care throughout your
pregnancy and during your birth. You will see your obstetrician at each
antenatal visit. If they are on leave on unavailable, you will see a different
obstetrician. During the birth, midwives will care for and support you. Your
obstetrician will also be there to oversee the birth and provide you with any
extra medical support you might need.

Private care entitles you to a private room, subject to availability.

you will need to pay a consultant's fee as well as a hospital fee. Check with
your private health insurance provider what fees are covered under your plan.
