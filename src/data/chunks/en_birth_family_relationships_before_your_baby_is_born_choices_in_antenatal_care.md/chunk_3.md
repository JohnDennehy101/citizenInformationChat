##  Rules

If you live in Ireland (or if you intend to live here for at least 1 year),
you can get free antenatal care through the [ Maternity and Infant Care Scheme
](/en/health/health-services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-
services/) . You do not need a [ medical card ](https://www2.hse.ie/medical-
cards/) or a [ GP visit card ](https://www2.hse.ie/services/gp-visit-cards/gp-
visit-cards.html) to get free antenatal care.

All expectant mothers who live in Ireland are entitled to free maternity care.
This covers antenatal visits, labour, delivery and postnatal care. Most women
chose to have their antenatal care split between their GP and a maternity
unit/hospital obstetrician. This is known as ‘combined care’ or ‘shared care’.

Alternatively, you may choose to get all your care at the hospital's antenatal
clinic. This option is available in all maternity units and hospitals. You
will be asked if you intend to be a public, semi-private or private patient
when you ring to make your first appointment.

Both options are covered by the [ Maternity and Infant Care Scheme
](/en/health/health-services/reproductive_health/maternity-and-infant-welfare-
services/) .
