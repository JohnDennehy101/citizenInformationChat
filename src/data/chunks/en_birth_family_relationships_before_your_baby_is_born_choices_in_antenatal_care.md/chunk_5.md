##  Semi-private care

Semi-private care is only available in Dublin maternity hospitals.

If you choose this option, a consultant obstetrician will have overall
responsibility for your care. You will also meet a consultant or a specialist
registrar in obstetrics each time you go to the hospital.

During the birth, you will be cared for by midwives with additional support
from the hospital doctors if needed. Afterwards, you will stay in a semi-
private ward with approximately 3-5 other mothers. However, if a semi-private
ward is unavailable, you might stay in a public ward.

You will have to pay a fee for semi-private care. If you have private health
insurance, check with your insurer what is covered under your plan.
