##  What services are provided by GPs in Ireland?

GPs provide a broad service on all health issues and may refer you to see a
specialist or hospital consultant if your condition needs further
investigation. You cannot see a consultant for the first time without a
referral from a GP.

As well as health consultations, GPs may also provide:

  * Prescriptions for medicine 
  * Immunisation and vaccination services 
  * Maternity care 
  * Family planning services. 

The range of services on offer can vary between GPs. Contact the GP before
your visit to make sure they have the service you need.

GPs may also now provide abortion services in Ireland. You read more

services/reproductive_health/unplanned-pregnancy/) and find information on
abortion services in Ireland on our website and from HSE [ myoptions.ie
