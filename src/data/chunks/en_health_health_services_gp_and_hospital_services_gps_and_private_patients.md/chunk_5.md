##  How do I find a GP in Ireland?

You can find out which GPs are available in your local area using the [ HSEâ€™s
Health Atlas ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/maps/) .

Sometimes GP practices have a full list of patients and cannot take on new
patients. In this case, you should go to another GP practice in your area. You
can transfer to the GP of your first choice at a later date if they start
taking on new patients again.

You do not need a [ Personal Public Service (PPS) number
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/personal-public-service-number/) or other documentation to visit a GP.
