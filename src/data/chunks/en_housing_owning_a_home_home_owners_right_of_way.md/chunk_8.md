##  Registering a private right of way

**There is no requirement to register a right of way.**

The [ Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2009/act/27/enacted/en/html) set-out a
requirement to register certain rights of way. But, the [ Land and
Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Act 2021
](http://citizensinformationboard.newsweaver.com/6xhzlt1oik/175hb40gzz51k1p2eurh6b/external?email=true&a=5&p=8966869&t=2911414)
amended this before the deadline for mandatory registration passed. This means
that registration remained optional.

Though, there are benefits to registering your right of way. For example, if
your right of way is registered it will be recorded on your property’s folio
so people can see it. A folio is an official document that describes the
property and who owns it.

**How can I register a private right of way?**

You can register a private right of way with [ Tailte Éireann
](https://www.tailte.ie/) by swearing and submitting an affidavit.

Tailte Éireann will notify the person who owns the land that the right of way
passes over to check that they do not dispute the right of way.

If there is no dispute about the right of way, they will note the right of way
on your property’s folio.

If there is a dispute over the right of way, you must apply to the [ Circuit
Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) to register the right of
way.

For more information about registering a private right of way, see [ Tailte
Éireann’s website ](https://www.tailte.ie/registration/guidance-and-legal-
