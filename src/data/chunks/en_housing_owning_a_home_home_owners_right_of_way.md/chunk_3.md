##  What is the difference between a public and private right of way?

A public right of way means anyone can use it. For instance, a public road is
a public right of a way. There are very few registered public rights of way
that are not maintained as public roads.

Some walking paths are also public rights of way. However, many walking routes
are “permissive routes”, and not public rights of way. This means that the
landowner allows you to use the route but could withdraw that permission at
any time. See our page on [ Walking and rambling in Ireland ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/sport-and-leisure/walking-and-rambling-in-ireland/) for more
information about this.

Only certain people can use a private right of way. They can only use it for
specific reasons, such as to access their property. Private rights of way are
typically arrangements between neighbours. A private right of way could be a
laneway, a boreen or a gap in a fence that leads to a property owned by
someone who does not own the laneway, boreen or gap. These private rights of
way are also known as easements.
