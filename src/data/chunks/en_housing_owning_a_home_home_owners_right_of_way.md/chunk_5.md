###  Establishing a right of way by using it

Generally, a private right of way is established if you openly use land,
without the owner’s permission, in a particular way for a specific number of
years. For example, a farmer may have travelled over a neighbour’s land with
their livestock or machinery for many years. This is sometimes known as
'acquisition by prescription'.

Traditionally, a right of way is established when you have travelled over the
land continuously for more than 20 years.
