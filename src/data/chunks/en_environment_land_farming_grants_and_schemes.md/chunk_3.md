###  **What is the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)?**

The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is a policy for all EU countries which
includes key objectives for farmers. These include things like:

  * Ensuring a fair income for farmers 
  * Preserving landscapes and biodiversity 
  * Increasing competitiveness in farming 
  * Supporting generational renewal 
  * Protecting food and health quality 
  * Fostering knowledge and innovation 
  * Caring for the environment and meeting climate change goals 

Ireland has a [ CAP Strategic Plan
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/76026-common-agricultural-policy-cap-
post-2020/) which runs from 2023-2027. This plan explains how CAP works in
Ireland and what schemes are available to farmers.

Under this plan, the schemes are divided into 2 different pillars:

  * Pillar 1: Direct payments and market measures 
  * Pillar 2: Rural development including the Targeted Agriculture Modernisation Schemes 3 (TAMS 3)
