##  Can my passport be cancelled or revoked?

If your passport is [ lost or stolen ](/en/travel-and-
recreation/passports/replacing-a-lost-or-stolen-irish-passport/) and you
notify the Passport Service of this, your passport will be cancelled.

The Passport Service has the power to revoke your passport if:

  * Your citizenship by naturalisation is revoked by the Department of Justice 
  * The passport was issued in error, or fraudulently 
  * Cancelling the passport is in the interests of public safety or security, either in Ireland or abroad 

A child’s passport may be revoked on the order of a court, if the court
believes removing the passport is in the child’s best interest.
