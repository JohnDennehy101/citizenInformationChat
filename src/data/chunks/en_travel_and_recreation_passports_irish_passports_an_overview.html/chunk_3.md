###  Machine-readable passports and electronic passports (ePassports)

A machine-readable passport is a passport with 2 typeface lines printed at the
bottom of the biographical page [the photo page], which can be read by a
machine. When they are read, these lines provide identical information to that
provided on the biographical page.

An electronic passport (ePassport) is the same as a normal machine-readable
passport but it also has a small integrated circuit or chip embedded in the
photo page. The chip securely stores a digitised image of the photo and
personal details of the passport holder. The chip allows facial recognition
technology at border controls. The Irish Passport Office has issued ePassports
since October 2006.
