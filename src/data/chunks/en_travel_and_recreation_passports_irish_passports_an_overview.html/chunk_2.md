##  Introduction

A passport is an internationally recognised travel document that confirms your
identity and nationality.

You must be an [ Irish citizen ](/en/moving-country/irish-citizenship/your-
right-to-irish-citizenship/) to be eligible for an Irish passport.

You can get Irish citizenship by [ birth or descent ](/en/moving-
country/irish-citizenship/irish-citizenship-through-birth-or-descent/) or
through [ naturalisation ](/en/moving-country/irish-citizenship/becoming-an-
irish-citizen-through-naturalisation/) . If you are the spouse or civil
partner of an Irish citizen you can apply for citizenship through
naturalisation if you meet certain conditions.

Your passport is an important legal document. You should always keep it in a
secure place. Every Irish passport has a unique identification number. You
should keep a note of this number, in case your passport is lost or stolen.

Your Irish passport allows you to travel abroad and entitles you to certain [
diplomatic support services ](/en/moving-country/moving-abroad/leaving-
ireland/diplomatic-supports/) from Irish embassies if you get into difficulty
abroad. While your Irish passport is an internationally recognised travel
document, it does not give you an automatic right to enter other countries.

Your Irish passport is issued by the Irish Government through the Passport
Service of the [ Department of Foreign Affairs
](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/) in Ireland. Irish passports are also issued
through Irish embassies and consulates throughout the world. You apply to the
relevant embassy or consulate if you are living abroad.
