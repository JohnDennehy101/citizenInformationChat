##  Power of attorney

A power of attorney is a document in which you (the donor) authorise another
person (the donee or attorney) to act for you in certain matters – on your
behalf and in your name – in accordance with the terms set out in the
document. A power of attorney can be specific (limited to a particular
purpose, for example, sale of your house in your absence) or general
(entitling the attorney to do almost everything that you yourself could do).

A power of attorney must always be in writing.

There are two kinds of power of attorney:

  * Power of attorney which gives either a specific or a general power and ceases as soon as the donor becomes incapacitated 
  * [ Enduring power of attorney ](/en/death/before-a-death/power-of-attorney/) which takes effect on the incapacity of the donor
