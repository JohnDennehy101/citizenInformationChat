###  **Temporary agent arrangement**

If you are unable to collect your payment at a post office for a short period
of time a temporary agent can be appointed by completing an [ Appointment of
Temporary Agent Form (pdf)
](https://www.anpost.com/AnPost/media/PDFs/Appointment-of-Temporary-Agent.pdf)
which is available at the post office. When collecting your payment the agent
presents and signs this form along with their photo identification and your
social services card or Public Services Card.
