##  Introduction

There may be many reasons why you are unable to deal with your affairs. For
example, you may be physically unable to collect your pension or you may
acquire an illness or disability that limits your ability to make decisions.
If you become incapable of dealing with your affairs, there are various legal
arrangements you can make to have someone else do these things on your behalf.

The choice of legal arrangements open to you depends on your precise
circumstances. Some of the arrangements are very simple to make and have
limited effect, for example, appointing an agent to collect your social
welfare payment. Others are much more complex and require the help of legal
and medical professionals, for example, executing an enduring power of
attorney. It is advisable to  take legal advice  before entering into the more
complex arrangements.
