##  Agency arrangements for social welfare payments

The Department of Social Protection (DSP) has the power under social welfare
legislation to make payments to a third party acting on behalf of a social
welfare recipient. The legal status of a social welfare agency relationship is
different from the general agency relationship in that the social welfare
agency may be put in place or may continue in operation if you become mentally
incapable.

If an agent is appointed to collect the money, it is still your money and
there is a legal duty on the agent to use it on your behalf and for your
benefit. The DSP may end the agency arrangement at any time where it has
reason to believe that the arrangement is not working satisfactorily.

There are 3 different types of social welfare agency arrangements.
