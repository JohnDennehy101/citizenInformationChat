###  **Nominating an agent to collect your payment**

If you are unable to collect your payment at a post office, due to an illness
or loss of mobility for example, you can nominate a person to do this on your
behalf by completing and returning the form [ Authority to Appoint an Agent
form (pdf) ](https://assets.gov.ie/44370/a606cd22a6ca4d9d927222e349dc4a11.pdf)
. Arrangements are made with the post office to facilitate the agent
collecting the payment and you are notified of this.
