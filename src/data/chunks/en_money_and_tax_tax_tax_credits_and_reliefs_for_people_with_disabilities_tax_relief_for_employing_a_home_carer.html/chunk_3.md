##  Rules

If you employ a carer for yourself or on behalf of a family member, you can
claim the tax relief on the cost of that care. A _family member_ is a spouse,
civil partner, child or a relative, including a relation by marriage or civil
partnership.

The person being cared for must be totally incapacitated throughout the tax
year (January to December) in which you are claiming the tax relief, however,
this is not a requirement for the first year that you prove the person is
totally incapacitated. The carer does not have to be employed for the full tax
year. The term _totally incapacitated_ means that the person being cared for
is disabled and requires a carer.

You cannot claim tax relief for employing a carer if the carer only carries
out housekeeper duties or if a [ Dependent Relative Tax Credit ](/en/money-
and-tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/dependent-
relative-tax-credit/) or an [ Incapacitated Child Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/tax-credits-and-reliefs-for-people-with-disabilities/incapacitated-
child-tax-credit/) has already been granted.

You may be asked by the Revenue Commissioners to get a medical certificate to
confirm the nature of the disability but it is not necessary to send one in
with your application form.
