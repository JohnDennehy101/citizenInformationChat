##  Rates

Tax allowances and reliefs reduce the amount of tax that you have to pay. The
amount by which this relief will reduce your tax depends on your rate of tax.
[ You can find out more about how your income tax is calculated ](/en/money-
and-tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/) .

You can claim tax relief (at your highest rate) on the lower of the following
two amounts:

  * The actual cost incurred or 
  * The maximum of â‚¬75,000 

You must claim the relief each year. You can get tax relief on the cost of
employing a carer, less any amount recovered from the [ Health Service
Executive (HSE) ](/en/health/health-system/health-service-executive/) . If two
or more of you pay for the care, the relief is divided between you in
proportion to the amount each paid.
