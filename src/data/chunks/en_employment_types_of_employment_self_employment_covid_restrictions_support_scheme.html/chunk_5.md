####  How do I qualify?

With the removal of public health restrictions from 22 January 2022,
businesses will no longer qualify for the CRSS.

Your business premises must be either closed to customers or substantially
restricted in operating due to COVID-19 restrictions. You must intend to
reopen once the restrictions have been lifted.

If you operate more than one business premises that are impacted, you can make
a claim in respect of each premises.

You must self-declare to Revenue that because of the COVID-19 restrictions,
turnover for the restricted period is disrupted by 75% compared to 2019
levels.

If your business was set up between 26 December 2019 and 12 October 2020, the
claim will be based on your actual weekly average turnover in the period
between the start–up date and 12 October 2020.

If your business was set up between 13 October 2020 and 26 July 2021, you can
now apply for the CRSS. The weekly payment will be calculated based on
turnover between the date your business commenced, and 26 July 2021. Read
