###  CRSS payment rates

You could claim to Revenue under the CRSS for a cash payment known as an
Advance Credit for Trading Expenses (ACTE).

This payment was equal to 10% of your average weekly turnover in 2019 up to
€20,000 and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of €5,000. See
table below.

**CRSS payments**

**Weekly turnover** |  **Rate** |  **Amount**  
First €20,000  |  10%  |  €2,000   
Next €60,000  |  5%  |  €3,000   
Maximum payment  |  |  €5,000   
  
If your business was established between 13 October 2020 and 26 July 2021, the
claim was based on 10% of your average weekly turnover in the period between
the date of commencement and 1 August 2021 (up to a maximum of €20,000).

You can claim 5% of your average weekly turnover for the reference period that
exceeds €20,000.

You can also get the Advance Credit for Trading Expenses (ACTE). This will
include your weekly amount, multiplied by the number of weeks in which the
restrictions are in place (up to €5,000 per week).
