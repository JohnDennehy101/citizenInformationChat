###  Restart week payment

From 22 January 2022, with the removal of public health restrictions,
businesses are no longer restricted from operating. You will no longer qualify
for the CRSS.

For the week beginning 24 January 2022, you can claim an extra restart week
payment, to help with the costs of reopening fully.

The process for making a claim for the restart week payment is set out in
Section 7.2 and 7.3 of [ Revenueâ€™s CRSS Guidelines (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/press-office/budget-
information/2021/crss-guidelines.pdf) .
