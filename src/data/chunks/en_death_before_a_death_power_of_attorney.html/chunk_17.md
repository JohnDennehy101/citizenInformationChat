###  Revocation of an enduring power of attorney **made on or after 26 April
2023**

Once the EPA has been registered, it can be revoked or varied by informing the
Decision Support Service (DSS). This is only if a notification of a lack of
capacity has not been subject to a notification that has been accepted by the
Decision Support Service.

Your application to be revoked or varied must include:

  * A statement that you understand the implications of your request 
  * A statement by a solicitor or barrister that you understand the implications of your request, and that they are satisfied that you are not acting under any pressure from another person 
  * If being varied, a statement by the attorney that they are aware of the variation 

EPAs made **before 26 April 2023** do not need to be registered with the DSS
and can only be revoked in the High Court.
