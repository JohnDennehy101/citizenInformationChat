##  Monitoring EPAs

The Decision Support Service (DSS) monitors EPAs. They also keep a register of
EPAs.

If your attorney informs the DSS that you have lost your capacity, they must
also submit a list of your assets. They must submit a written report to the
DSS every year, which sets out details of the costs, expenses or money paid to
the attorney. They must keep proper accounts and records.

The DSS can send a [ general visitor
](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/services/expert-panels/general-visitors-
panel) or a [ special visitor
](https://decisionsupportservice.ie/services/specialist-panels/special-
visitors) to talk to your attorney if they get a complaint, or if they want to
check that the attorney is acting in your best interests.
