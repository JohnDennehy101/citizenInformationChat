###  EPAs made on or after 26 April 2023

When the attorney has reason to believe that the donor lacks capacity in
relation to a decision in an EPA, the donor must notify the Decision Support
Service. The notification must be accompanied by statements from 2 people who
are doctors or healthcare professionals supporting that belief. The donor and
a number of other persons must also be put on notice of the notification to
the Decision Support Service.

Within 5 weeks, the donor or a notice party can lodge a notice of objection on
[ one of the grounds given in Section 71B of the Act
](https://www.decisionsupportservice.ie/services/objections/reasons-making-
objection/reasons-objecting-enduring-power-attorney) with the Decision Support
Service.

If the Decision Support Service is not satisfied with the application, it will
notify the donor and the attorney.

However, once the Decision Support Service has been notified that the donor
lacks capacity, the attorney may take certain limited actions in accordance
with powers granted in the EPA to maintain you and prevent loss to your
estate.

While waiting for acceptance of the notification from the Decision Support
Service, the attorney may also make any decisions permitted under the powers
that cannot reasonably be deferred until the application for registration has
been determined. The attorney may also maintain themself and other persons, in
so far as it is permitted under Section 71A of the Assisted Decision Making
(Capacity Act) 2015, as amended.

An attorney is required to provide a report to the Decision Support Service on
any actions taken and the reasons why the action could not be deferred.
