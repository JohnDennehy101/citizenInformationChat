##  When should an enduring power of attorney be registered?

An application should be made to the Decision Support Service to register an
EPA within 3 months of being made. The Decision Support Service will then
review the application and, if valid, register it.

If the Decision Support Service is not satisfied with the application, it will
notify the donor and the attorney.

EPAs that were made before 26 April 2023 do not need to be registered with the
Decision Support Service.
