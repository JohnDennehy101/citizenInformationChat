###  Who must I notify when I have made an EPA?

You must notify various people after you have made an EPA, including:

  * Your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant 
  * Your children (over the age of 18) 
  * Any other persons who you may have appointed to assist you in making decisions under the 2015 Act 

You may also specify in your EPA that certain other people be notified.
