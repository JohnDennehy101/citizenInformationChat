##  Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015

The [ Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 ](/en/health/legal-matters-
and-health/assisted-decision-making-act/) changed the law that governs the
creation and monitoring of EPAs.

The process of making an EPA is the same as before and EPAs that were already
correctly made under the [ Powers of Attorney Act 1996
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1996/act/12/enacted/en/html) remain
valid.

**EPAs made on or after 26 April 2023**

The most important change is that the EPA must be registered with the Decision
Support Service within 3 months of being made. The Decision Support Service
must also be notified when the donor lacks capacity. The Decision Support
Service then supervises and monitors the EPA to make sure that the donor’s
interests are protected.

**EPAs made before 26 April 2023**

If you made an EPA before the 26 April 2023, you do not need to register it
with the Decision Support Service. If you lack capacity to make decisions,
your attorney will register the EPA with the Office of the Wards of Court.

The only change for EPAs that were made before 26 April 2023 is that they now
come under the Decision Support Service’s complaints procedure. Previously,
complaints about EPAs had to go to the [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/high-court/) , which was a long and costly process.
