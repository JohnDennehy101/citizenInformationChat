###  Personal welfare decisions

You can grant the attorney the power to make certain personal welfare
decisions on your behalf.

A personal welfare decision includes a decision concerning one or more of the
following:

  * Your accommodation, including whether you should live in a designated centre 
  * Your participation in employment, education or training 
  * Your participation in social activities 
  * Decisions on any social services provided or to be provided you 
  * Healthcare 

Healthcare does not include medical interventions. For example, the attorney
does not have the power to decide as to whether or not a person suffering from
dementia should undergo surgery. You can make an [ Advance Healthcare
Directive ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-health/advance-care-directives/) to
outline the medical treatment you would prefer in the event that you can no
longer communicate your wishes.
