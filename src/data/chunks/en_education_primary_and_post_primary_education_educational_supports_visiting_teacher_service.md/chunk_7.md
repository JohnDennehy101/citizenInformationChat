##  How to get a visit from the Visiting Teacher Service?

Before a child is assessed for the Visiting Teacher Service, you must complete
a [ referral form for the Visiting Teacher Service (MS Word)
](https://ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Referral-Form_Visiting-
Teacher_NCSE_14.04.22.doc) .

You must provide an up-to-date audiology or ophthalmology report, with your
form.

You should send the referral application directly to the [ local Visiting
Teacher ](https://ncse.ie/vt_contact_details) .

Referrals to the VTS can be made by:

  * Parents or guardians 
  * Schools 
  * [ Health Service Executive (HSE) ](/en/health/health-system/health-service-executive/)
  * Eye clinics 
  * [ Vision Ireland ](http://www.ncbi.ie/)
  * [ Chime ](https://www.chime.ie/)
  * The [ National Hearing Implant & Viani Research Centre ](http://www.nhivrc.ie/index.html)

Any health professional who wishes to refer a child should first discuss their
concerns fully with the child's parents or guardians.

The VTS will assess your child to find out if the service is suitable for your
child. No child is too young to get a visit from the visiting teacher service

**The Visiting Teacher Service will also accept referrals where a child's
visual impairment or deafness is not their main disability, but makes their
overall situation more challenging.**

You can find out more the Visiting Teacher Service on the [ National Council
for Special Education (NCSE) website ](https://ncse.ie/visiting-teachers) .
