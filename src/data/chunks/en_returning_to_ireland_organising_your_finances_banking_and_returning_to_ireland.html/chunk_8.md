##  Basic bank accounts (EU residents only)

If you are resident of any EU country and you do not already have a bank
account in Ireland, you can open a basic bank account.

A basic bank account is like a current account, but there are no charges for
everyday banking for at least the first year. This means you can withdraw cash
from an ATM and use a debit card for payments without any extra cost. However,
your debit card may not come with the contactless payment feature.
