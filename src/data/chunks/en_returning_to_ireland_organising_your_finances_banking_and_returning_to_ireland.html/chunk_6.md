###  **My employer or utility company won’t accept my IBAN**

Employers and companies in Ireland must accept IBANs from other SEPA
countries. This is set out in [ Article 9 of the SEPA Regulation (pdf)
](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32012R0260&from=EN) , and [ SI 132/2013
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2013/si/132/made/en/print) .

If your SEPA IBAN is not accepted, this is called ‘IBAN discrimination’. You
should make a written complaint to the employer or utility company, advising
them of their obligation.

If that does not resolve the issue, you can report it to the responsible
authority:

  * The [ Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/consumers-home/contact/) for cases between consumers and traders, for example, utility companies 
  * [ The Central Bank of Ireland ](https://www.centralbank.ie/consumer-hub/explainers/what-is-iban-discrimination-and-what-can-i-do-about-it) for other cases, for example, between employees and employers
