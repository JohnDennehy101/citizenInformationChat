##  What you should know before you complain

If you want to complain about a radio or television broadcast, or a piece of
journalism, first check if the media company involved is regulated in Ireland.

The following types of media broadcasts or articles are **not** currently
under the control of the Press Council or licensed and regulated by the
Broadcast Authority of Ireland:

  * Television broadcasts that originate outside of Ireland (for example, BBC or Sky) 
  * Programmes and movies streamed on platforms such as Netflix. The exception is catch up TV services from channels that are regulated by the BAI. 
  * Foreign newspapers that are available in Ireland (unless they are Irish versions of these newspapers, for example The Irish Sun) 
  * Online news channels that are not [ members of the Irish Press Council ](https://www.presscouncil.ie/press-council-of-ireland/member-publications)
  * Social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram 

From 15 March 2023, certain audiovisual on-demand media services, social media
services and other relevant online services need to be registered and will be
regulated by the new Coimisiún na Meán (or the Media Commission).
