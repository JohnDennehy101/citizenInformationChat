##  How to complain about a radio or TV programme

If you believe that you have been defamed by a television or radio broadcast,
you can get legal advice.

The Broadcast Authority of Ireland will not investigate complaints where legal
action has begun.

From 15 March 2023, Coimisiún na Meán will replace the BAI as the media
regulator for [ online safety ](/en/consumer/buying-digital-content-and-
services/online-safety/) , television broadcasting and video on-demand
services. The process below is still the same for viewers and listeners. You
must complain to the broadcaster in the first instance. You can read more
about this on the [ Coimisiún na Meán website
