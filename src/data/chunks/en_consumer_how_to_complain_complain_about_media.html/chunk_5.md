###  How do I complain to the company?

First, send your complaint in writing, by post or email, to the editor of the
publication, explaining why you think the article has breached the code of
practice. You must also explain why the material directly affects you.

If you do not get a response within a reasonable amount of time (about 2
weeks) or if you are not happy with the response, make a complaint in writing
to the Press Ombudsman. You can also complain about the behaviour of a
journalist.
