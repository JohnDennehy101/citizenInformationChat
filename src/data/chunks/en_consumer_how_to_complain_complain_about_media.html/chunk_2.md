##  Introduction

Irish television channels, newspapers and online newspapers mainly run without
state interference or censorship. Instead, licensed media companies agree to
follow codes of practice on how they should behave, and give guidelines on
what they should and should not publish or broadcast.

This page explains what you can do if you want to complain about a television
broadcast, a newspaper article or a piece of journalism that is published
online.

[ The Broadcast Authority of Ireland (BAI) ](https://www.bai.ie/en/) is the
independent body that oversees television and radio broadcasts in Ireland. On
15 March 2023, Coimisiún na Meán (this means the media commission) replaced
the BAI as the media regulator for [ online safety ](/en/consumer/buying-
digital-content-and-services/online-safety/) , television broadcasting and
video on-demand services.

[ The Press Council ](https://www.presscouncil.ie/) is the independent body
that oversees news publications. The BAI and the Press Ombudsman can
investigate complaints and decide if the media company involved has breached
the code of practice.

Freedom of expression is protected in the Irish Constitution. This is the
right to freely express your convictions and opinions. However, Ireland also
has censorship laws, which restrict freedom of expression in certain
circumstances. You can find out more about [ censorship in Ireland
