##  Who is declared a hostile witness?

If the evidence you give under oath changes significantly from what you said
earlier in a pre-trial statement or if you refuse to answer questions which
you could be expected to answer in a particular manner, the solicitor or
barrister who called you to be a witness can ask the judge to decide if you
are hostile. This application must be made to the judge without the [ jury
](/en/justice/courtroom/jury/) present.

The judge has to decide whether you are a hostile witness or an unfavourable
witness. Just because you give unhelpful or unfavourable evidence does not
mean the person calling you can attack your credibility.
