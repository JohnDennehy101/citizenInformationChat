##  UK citizens and health services in Ireland

UK citizens who are resident in Ireland are [ entitled to health services
](/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-public-health-services/) in the same
way as Irish citizens who are resident. This means that they may access public
health services if they are '  ordinarily resident  '. This is an agreement
between Ireland and the UK, and did not change with the UK's departure from
the European Union.
