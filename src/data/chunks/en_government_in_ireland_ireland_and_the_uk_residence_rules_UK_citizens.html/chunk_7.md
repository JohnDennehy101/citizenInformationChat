###  Sponsors

You must have a sponsor for your application. A sponsor must be:

  * A UK citizen 
  * Living in Ireland, or intending to live in Ireland 
  * Able to support you financially 

The sponsor must not have been mainly relying on social welfare payments in
the 2 year period before your application. Also, they must have gross earnings
(before tax and deductions) above the [ Working Family Payment rates
](/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/social-welfare-payments-to-
families-and-children/family-income-supplement#l2b73a) for your family size in
each of the last 3 years.

If you are the spouse or partner of the sponsor, they cannot have sponsored
anyone else for residence in Ireland in the 7 years before your application.

Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) can also consider the conduct of the
sponsor in Ireland (for example, if they have a criminal record).
