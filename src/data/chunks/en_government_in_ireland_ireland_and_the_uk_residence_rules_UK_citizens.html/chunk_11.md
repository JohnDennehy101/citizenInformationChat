##  Social welfare payments in Ireland

UK citizens living in Ireland can apply for social welfare payments in the
same way as Irish citizens living in Ireland.

With all [ social welfare payments in Ireland
](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social_welfare/social_welfare_payments/)
, you must satisfy the rules for each scheme to qualify. For example, you must
be habitually resident in Ireland to qualify for most means-tested social
welfare payments.

Residence in the [ Common Travel Area ](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-
the-uk/common-travel-area-between-ireland-and-the-uk/) is treated the same way
as residence in Ireland for the purposes of the [ habitual residence condition
(HRC) ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-assistance-
payments/habitual-residence-condition/) . However, UK citizens who have
recently moved to Ireland may find it more difficult to establish that their
main centre of interest is in Ireland.

If you are currently getting a social welfare payment in Ireland, it will
continue to be paid after the UK leaves the EU, as long as you continue to
fulfil the qualifying criteria for the payment. The Department of Social
Protection has published [ guidance on social welfare payments and Brexit
](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/96847e-brexit-update-deasp/)
.

If you are receiving a payment from the UK (for example, a British pension)
you will continue to receive it after the UK leaves the EU.

Social contributions (PRSI in Ireland, and National Insurance in the UK) paid
in the UK will continue to be assessed towards Irish pensions and other social
welfare benefits.
