##  When is criminal legal aid not granted?

Criminal legal aid is normally not granted in the following circumstances:

  * Where the judge decides that the charge is not serious enough (for example, [ minor offences ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-offences/classification-of-crimes-in-criminal-cases/#l73512) ) 
  * Where the judge decides that you can afford to pay for your own legal advice 
  * Extradition proceedings 
  * Most [ judicial review ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-accountability/judicial-review-public-decisions/) proceedings 

If you are not granted criminal legal aid, you may in some cases be able to
apply for free legal representation under another scheme (see ‘Other legal aid
schemes’ below).
