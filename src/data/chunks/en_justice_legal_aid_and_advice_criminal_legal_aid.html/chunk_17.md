###  **Criminal Assets Bureau Ad-Hoc Legal Aid Scheme**

The Criminal Assets Bureau Ad-Hoc Legal Aid Scheme provides legal aid if you
are a defendant in a court case brought by the [ Criminal Assets Bureau
](https://www.cab.ie/) and cannot afford legal representation.

The scheme covers:

  * Court proceedings under the [ Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1996/en/act/pub/0030/index.html) , Revenue Acts or Social Welfare Acts 
  * Social welfare appeals made to the [ Circuit Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) under Section 307 of the [ Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0026/index.html)
  * Tax appeals made to the Circuit Court under the Taxes Acts where the Criminal Assets Bureau is the respondent 
  * Applications made by the [ Director of Public Prosecutions ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/director-of-public-prosecutions/) under Section 39 of the [ Criminal Justice Act 1994 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0015/index.html)

To qualify for the scheme, you must demonstrate to the court that you cannot
afford legal representation. If the court grants the scheme, they will make an
order.

The scheme is not an alternative to costs, so you or your legal representative
must apply to the court at the start of the proceedings. You should get legal
advice to see if you are eligible for the scheme.
