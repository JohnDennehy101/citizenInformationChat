##  How to apply for criminal legal aid

You can apply for legal aid in person on the day you attend court, or by
writing to the Court Registrar. Criminal cases start in either the [ District
Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) or in some cases, the [
Special Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/special-criminal-court/) .

If you have been accused of a crime and attend court without legal
representation, the court should make you aware that you may be entitled to
criminal legal aid.

If you already have a solicitor, they can apply on your behalf, but they must
be on the [ Criminal Legal Aid Panel ](https://www.courts.ie/legal-aid) to be
covered by the scheme (see ‘Can I choose my solicitor?’ below).
