###  **Does legal aid carry across all courts?**

Legal aid granted in a court applies only to matters that concern that court.
For example, legal aid granted in the [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/district-court/) only covers District Court proceedings.

If the District Court sends your case to a higher court to be dealt with and
you were already granted free legal aid, you will need to make a new
application for legal aid to the higher court.

A higher court is unlikely to refuse to grant a legal aid certificate if the
District Court granted you one for the same matter.
