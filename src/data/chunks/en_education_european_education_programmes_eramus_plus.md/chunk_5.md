##  What costs does Erasmus+ cover?

You will generally get Erasmus+ funding to help cover your travel costs and
living expenses such as accommodation and food. Any costs not related to these
you will have to cover yourself. The amount of funding you get depends on the
type of project you are on.

Extra funding is available to support people with disabilities and from
disadvantaged backgrounds.

Higher education students will not have to pay fees for tuition, registration,
examinations, and charges for access to laboratories or libraries in the
institution where they are studying with Erasmus+. Fees for insurance or
student union membership may still apply.

You can find information on grant levels and types of funding in the [
Erasmus+ Programme Guide ](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-
plus/resources/programme-guide_en) . You may get additional grants from your
institution, government or other sources. Check the [ European Funding Guide
](http://www.european-funding-guide.eu/) .
