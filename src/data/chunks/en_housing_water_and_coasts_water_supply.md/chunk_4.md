###  Public water schemes

Public water mains are administered and maintained by Irish Water, however
local authorities provide certain services on behalf of Irish Water through
service level agreements.

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage funds the provision
and upgrading of capital projects in water and wastewater services. Irish
Water administer the actual building of public water supply projects.
Stringent water testing is carried out on all public waters by local
authorities and the results are provided to the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) each year.

**Irish water plebiscite on ownership**

Section 2 of the Water Services Act 2014 provides that, before a Bill can be
proposed for the sale of any share in Irish Water to anyone other than a
Government Minister, a number of steps must be taken:

  * A resolution must be passed by each House of the Oireachtas (the DÃ¡il and the Seanad) approving such a proposal 
  * A proposal to allow for such a sale must be submitted to a plebiscite and 
  * The proposal must be approved in the plebiscite 

Anyone with a right to vote in a referendum would have the right to vote in
this plebiscite.
