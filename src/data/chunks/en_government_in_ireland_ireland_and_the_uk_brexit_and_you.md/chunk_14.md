###  Data protection

Before the end of the transition period, any personal information received by
a company or organisation in the UK from companies and administrations in
other member states was [ covered by the GDPR ](/en/government-in-
ireland/data-protection/overview-of-general-data-protection-regulation/)
(General Data Protection Regulation).

Personal information can still be transferred from the EU to the UK based on a
formal decision (called an adequacy decision) made by the European Commission
on 28 June 2021. That adequacy decision will remain in place for 4 years
unless the UK makes changes to its data protection legislation.
