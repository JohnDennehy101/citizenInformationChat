###  Article 16 of the Protocol

Article 16 allows either the EU or the UK to take ‘safeguard measures’ if the
Protocol leads to serious and persistent economic, social or environmental
difficulties. If the EU or UK take safeguard measures (commonly called
‘invoking Article 16’), the other party could decide to implement ‘rebalancing
measures’ to counteract the effect of the change.
