###  Extradition to and from the UK

The prior [ European Arrest Warrant ](/en/justice/arrests/extradition-to-and-
from-ireland/) regime no longer applies to the UK in its current form.

The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement includes similar extradition rules
and procedures to the European Arrest Warrant regime and these rules continue
to allow extradition to Ireland from the UK and vice versa. These rules apply
to extradition requests made after 11pm on 31 December 2020 and any requests
before this date where the person sought had not been arrested at that time.
