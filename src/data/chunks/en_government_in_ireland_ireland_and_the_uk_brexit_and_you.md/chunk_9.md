###  Irish citizens living in the UK

If you are an Irish citizen and you want to continue living in the UK, you do
not need to apply to the [ EU Settlement Scheme ](https://www.gov.uk/settled-
status-eu-citizens-families) . Your rights to live, work and access public
services in the UK are still in place under the [ Common Travel Area
](/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-uk/common-travel-area-between-
ireland-and-the-uk/) arrangement. However, even though you do not need to
apply to the scheme, [ your family members from outside of the UK and Ireland
will need to apply ](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-
families/eligibility) .
