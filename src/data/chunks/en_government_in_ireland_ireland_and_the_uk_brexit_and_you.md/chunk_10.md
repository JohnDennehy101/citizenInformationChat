###  Non-Irish EU citizens living in the UK

The UK set up an EU Settlement Scheme, under which EU citizens and their
family members living in the UK could apply to continue living there after 30
June 2021.

EU citizens (except for Irish citizens) and their family members living in the
UK had to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme for settled status if they wish to
continue living in the UK after 30 June 2021. If you did not have 5 years’
continuous residence in the UK, you got pre-settled status instead.

  * Settled status means that you can live in the UK for as long as you want. You will have access to public funds and services (if you are eligible) and you can apply for British citizenship. Any children born in the UK after you get settled status will automatically be British citizens. 
  * Pre-settled status means that you can live in the UK for a further 5 years. When you have had 5 years’ continuous residence, you can then apply to change to settled status. You must do this before your pre-settled status expires. 

The deadline for most people applying was 30 June 2021. Some people [ can
apply after this date ](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-
