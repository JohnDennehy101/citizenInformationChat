##  The Withdrawal Agreement, transition period and the Trade and Cooperation
Agreement

The Withdrawal Agreement between the EU and the UK was published in October
2019.

The Withdrawal Agreement is one of the main documents governing the
relationship between the EU and the UK, but it does not resolve all of the
issues between the EU and the UK.

The transition period was put in place to allow agreements to be reached
between the EU and the UK without major disruption. It finished at the end of
2020.

A [ Trade and Cooperation Agreement ](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-
and-policy/relations-non-eu-countries/relations-united-kingdom/eu-uk-trade-
and-cooperation-agreement_en) was agreed between the EU and the UK and entered
into force on 1 May 2021. This governs some of the matters which were
previously dealt with under EU law such as trade in goods.
