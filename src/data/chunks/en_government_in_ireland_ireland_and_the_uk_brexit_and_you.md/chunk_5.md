###  Windsor Framework

In February 2023, the UK Government and the EU agreed the [ Windsor Framework
](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/relations-non-eu-
countries/relations-united-kingdom/eu-uk-withdrawal-agreement/protocol-
ireland-and-northern-ireland_en) . The Windsor Framework changed some aspects
of the Protocol. The Framework was formally adopted on 25 March 2023.

From September 2023, many goods travelling to Northern Ireland from Great
Britain have reduced checks, and a simpler process for goods has been
introduced. Goods going to Ireland and shipped through Northern Ireland still
have to meet all EU customs and import rules.

Some EU law continues to apply to Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland
Assembly can trigger a Petition of Concern (also called the â€˜Stormont Brake')
to pause any new EU laws that would have a serious effect on the people of
Northern Ireland.
