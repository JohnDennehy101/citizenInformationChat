##  Disability payments and volunteering

If you are getting Disability Allowance, Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension
you must get permission to work as a volunteer. You must apply to the section
that pays your social welfare payment **before** starting any voluntary work.

If you are getting Illness Benefit, you apply to the [ Partial Capacity
Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/partial-capacity-benefit/)
section for permission to do voluntary work.

If you are getting [ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/invalidity-pension/) , you must apply directly to the Invalidity
Pension section for permission. You can find out more about [ how the DSP
