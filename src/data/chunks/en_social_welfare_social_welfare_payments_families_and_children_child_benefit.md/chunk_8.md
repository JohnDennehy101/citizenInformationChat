###  **EU and EEA citizens**

If you are an [ EU or EEA citizen
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/european-union/european-union/) working in Ireland (employed or
self-employed), you automatically meet the [ habitual residence condition
(HRC) ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-assistance-payments/habitual-residence-condition/) .

You also meet the HRC if you have been working in Ireland but become
unemployed and get [ Jobseekerâ€™s Benefit
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/unemployed-
people/jobseekers-benefit/) .

If your child is living in a different EU or EEA country from you, you should
also apply for any family benefit payments you are entitled to in the country
where they live.
