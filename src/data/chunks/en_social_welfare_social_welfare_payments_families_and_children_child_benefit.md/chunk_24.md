###  **Change in circumstances**

You must tell the Department of Social Protection (DSP) in writing about any
changes in your circumstances which could affect your Child Benefit claim.

For example, you should tell the DSP if:

  * You change your address 
  * Your child no longer lives with you (or is not in your care) 
  * You start using a different bank or post office for your benefit payments 
  * Your child who is aged 16, 17 or 18 leaves full-time education 
  * You or your children leave Ireland (move abroad) 
  * You or your partner start work in another country 

Use [ Form CB56 ](https://www.gov.ie/en/form/69c3e8-child-benefit-change-of-
events-cb56/) to tell the DSP of any changes to your circumstances.
