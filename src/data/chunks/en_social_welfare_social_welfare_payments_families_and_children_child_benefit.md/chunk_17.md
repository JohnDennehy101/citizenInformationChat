###  **Applying for Child Benefit when your baby is born**

If your baby is born in Ireland, you must [ register their birth
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-
baby-is-born/registering-birth-your-baby/) within 3 months. After you do this,
the Department of Social Protection (DSP) will:

  * Give a [ Personal Public Service (PPS) number ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/personal-public-service-number/) to your baby, and 
  * Start a Child Benefit claim for your child (see more below).
