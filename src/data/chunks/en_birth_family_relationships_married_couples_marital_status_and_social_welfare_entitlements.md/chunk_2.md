##  Introduction

For the purposes of most social welfare payments in Ireland (for example, [
Jobseeker's Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-
allowance/) and [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-
welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) ), couples
who are cohabiting (living together) are treated in the same way as married
couples or civil partners. However, your marital status can affect your
entitlement to certain social welfare payments.
