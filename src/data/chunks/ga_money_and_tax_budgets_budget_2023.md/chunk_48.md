If you are paying for private rented accommodation, you can claim a new **Rent
Tax Credit** of €500 a year for 2022 and subsequent years. This tax credit
applies to each tenant rather than each tenancy. You will be able to claim
this credit for rent paid in 2022 early in 2023.

The tax deduction for **pre-letting expenses on vacant residential
properties** has doubled to €10,000 per property. The period of time a
property must have been vacant to claim these expenses has been reduced from
12 months to 6 months.

A **Vacant Homes Tax (VHT)** will be introduced in 2023. This will apply to
residential properties which are occupied for less than 30 days in a 12-month
period. The tax will be calculated at 3 times a property’s base Local Property
Tax rate.

A **Defective Concrete Products Levy** will be introduced to help pay for the
Defective Concrete Blocks Redress Scheme. It will be a 10% levy on concrete
blocks, pouring concrete and other concrete products. It will apply from 3
April 2023.

**Stamp Duty Residential Development Refund Scheme** is extended to the end of
2025.
