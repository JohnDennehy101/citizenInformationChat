####  Carbon Tax

Carbon Tax will increase by €7.50 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted, from
€41.00 to €48.50. This applies from 12 October 2022 for auto fuels but will be
offset by a levy reduction so that it will not result in a price increase. For
all other fuels, the Carbon Tax will increase from 1 May 2023. See
‘Environment and climate’ below, for examples of the price increases to common
household fuels.
