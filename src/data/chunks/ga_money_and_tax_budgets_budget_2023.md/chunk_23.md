####  Rent Tax Credit

If you are paying for private rented accommodation, you can claim a new Rent
Tax Credit of â‚¬500 a year for 2022 and subsequent years. This tax credit
applies to each tenant rather than each tenancy. For rent you pay in 2022, you
will be able to claim this credit early in 2023.
