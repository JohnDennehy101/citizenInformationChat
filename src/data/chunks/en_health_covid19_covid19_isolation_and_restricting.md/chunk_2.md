##  Introduction

**Self-isolation** means staying at home and completely avoiding contact with
other people.

You no longer need to restrict your movements, but you must self-isolate if
you develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19.

If you are at high risk from COVID-19, you should continue to follow public
health advice to [ protect yourself from COVID-19
](https://www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/preventing-the-spread/protect-
yourself-and-others/) and use your own judgement to stay safe in public and
crowded places.
