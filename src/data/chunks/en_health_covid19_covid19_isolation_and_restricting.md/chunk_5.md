##  How long do I self-isolate for?

If you have **tested positive for COVID-19** (PCR or antigen test), you should
stay at home for 5 days from when your symptoms started. If you have no
symptoms, stay at home for 5 days from the date of your test. You can leave
home after 5 days if your symptoms have fully or mostly gone for the last 48
hours.

You should self-isolate as soon as you notice symptoms of COVID-19 or get a
positive COVID-19 test result (PCR or antigen test).

If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and got a negative PCR or antigen test result
**or** you did not take a test but have symptoms, you should self-isolate
until 48 hours after your symptoms end.
