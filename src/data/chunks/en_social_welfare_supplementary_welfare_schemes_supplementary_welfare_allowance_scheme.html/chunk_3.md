###  Appealing a decision

If you are unhappy with the decision of a Community Welfare Officer on your
application, you can appeal the decision to the [ independent Social Welfare
Appeals Office ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-
welfare-appeals/) . The Social Welfare Appeals Office deals with appeals
relating to basic SWA and some SWA supplements, but does not decide on appeals
relating to Additional Needs Payment or Heating Supplements. However, you can
ask for an internal review to re-examine decisions on these payments. You
should try to submit as much additional information as possible to help your
case.
