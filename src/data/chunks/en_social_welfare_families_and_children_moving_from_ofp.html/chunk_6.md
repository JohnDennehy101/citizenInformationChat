###  OFP and Carer’s Allowance

People parenting alone, who meet the qualifying criteria for Carer's
Allowance, may qualify for both One-Parent Family Payment and [ half-rate
Carer's Allowance (CA) ](/en/social-welfare/carers/half-rate-carers-
allowance/) . If your youngest child is aged between 7 and 15, you must
qualify for Carer's Allowance to continue to get OFP. You will also get an
Increase for a Qualified Child (IQC) for any other children in the family
until they reach 18 (or 22 if in full-time education) while CA and OFP is in
payment. (See our document on [ One-Parent Family Payment ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/one-parent-family-payment/) for more information
on other exceptions to the age limits.)

This means that you can claim OFP and a half-rate Carer’s Allowance until your
youngest child turns 16 provided you continue to meet the conditions for both
schemes.
