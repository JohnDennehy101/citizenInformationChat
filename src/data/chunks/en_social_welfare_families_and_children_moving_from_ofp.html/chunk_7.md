###  OFP and Domiciliary Care Allowance

If you are getting [ Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA) ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/domiciliary-care-allowance/) for one of your
children, the age limit of 7 for the youngest child does not apply, and you
can retain your OFP payment. This means that you can continue to qualify for
OFP until that child is aged 16 or your DCA stops. You will also get an IQC
for any other children in the family until they reach 18 (or 22 if in full-
time education) while DCA and OFP is in payment. If your youngest child is
under 7 years of age when your DCA stops you may also continue to qualify for
OFP.
