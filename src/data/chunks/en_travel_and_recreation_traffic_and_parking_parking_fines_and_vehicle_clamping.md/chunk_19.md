###  If you want to appeal a clamping or relocation

If you are clamped and want to appeal the clamping or a relocation, you should
contact the parking controller. Information on the parking controller is
usually found on either the clamping notice or the receipt for payment of the
clamp release fee. You should give details of the situation and enclose any
documents that could help your case. Most complaints will be acknowledged
within a few days. Your appeal will be investigated and you should receive a
response within 21 days. If dissatisfied with the outcome of your appeal, you
may then be able to further appeal again to the [ National Transport Authority
(NTA) ](https://www.nationaltransport.ie/vehicle-clamping-regulation/) .
