###  Parking fines

There is a system of fines in place for illegal parking and non-payment of
parking fees. You get a parking ticket when you have been issued a fine.

If you get a parking fine, you must pay the fine to the traffic division of
the local authority within 28 days of the date of the fixed charge notice. If
you fail to pay within the allotted 28 days, the charge increases by 50%. If
the fine is unpaid after a further 28 days, court proceedings are initiated.
Details of where you can pay your parking fine should be written on your
parking ticket. If you fail to pay your parking fine and arenâ€™t formally
appealing the fine, you can be prosecuted.
