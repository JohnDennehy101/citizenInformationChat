###  Tow-away system

Local authorities are allowed to tow-away vehicles that have been abandoned or
illegally parked on a public road or in a local authority car park. Vehicles
are towed to a car pound and you may be charged a significant fee for their
release. If you think your car has been towed away, you should contact the
local authority responsible for the area where you parked.
