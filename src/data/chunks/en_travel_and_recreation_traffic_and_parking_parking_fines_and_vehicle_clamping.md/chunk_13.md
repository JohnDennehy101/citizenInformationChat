Different fines apply depending on where your car has been ticketed, clamped
or towed away from. The cost of the fine also depends on whether you have
parked in a _statutory area_ or a _non-statutory area_ .

A _statutory area_ is an area under the direction of a local authority.
Examples of statutory areas include public roads, airports and harbours.

A _non-statutory area_ is an area not under the direction of a local
authority. This includes private car parks and private residential parking.
