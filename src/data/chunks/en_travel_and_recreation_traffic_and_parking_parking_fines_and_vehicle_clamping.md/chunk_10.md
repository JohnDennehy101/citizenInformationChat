Vehicle clamping is in operation in some areas. Clamping services are run by
private companies on behalf of the local authority. Employees of the vehicle
clamping company can clamp vehicles and issue clamping notices for vehicles
that violate the parking regulations. The [ National Transport Authority
](https://www.nationaltransport.ie/) is responsible for the regulation of
clamping.
