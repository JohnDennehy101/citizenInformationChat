###  Parking restrictions

Parking is restricted during business hours in certain parts of most towns and
cities. During these hours, you are not allowed to obstruct clearways, bus
lanes and loading zones. Parking signs on these streets will clearly display
the hours that restrictions are in operation. Disabled parking spaces are off
limits at all times, unless you have an appropriate permit. See our page on [
Parking Permits for Disabled Drivers ](/en/travel-and-recreation/traffic-and-
parking/disabled-persons-parking-card/) .
