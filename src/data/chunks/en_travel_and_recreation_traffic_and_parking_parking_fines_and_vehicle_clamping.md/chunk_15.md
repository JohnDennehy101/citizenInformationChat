###  Rates in non-statutory areas (private carpark or private residential
parking)

If you park your vehicle in a non-statutory area and fail to pay the relevant
parking fee, or your ticket has expired, your vehicle may be clamped. Your
vehicle may also be clamped if you breach the terms and conditions that apply
where you parked.

The maximum fees for clamping, re-locating and impounding vehicles in non-
statutory areas are:

Situation  |  Maximum fee   
---|---  
Where your vehicle has been clamped  |  €125   
Where your vehicle has been relocated within a clamping place  |  €50   
Where your vehicle has been relocated within a clamping place and clamped  |  €150   
Where your vehicle has been relocated to a pound  |  €150 and an additional €50 in respect of each additional day (or part thereof) the vehicle is situated in the pound.
