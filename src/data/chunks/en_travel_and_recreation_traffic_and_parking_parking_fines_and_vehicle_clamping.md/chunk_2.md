##  Introduction

A system of parking fees, restrictions, fines and clamping is in place in
towns and cities in Ireland. This is to stop illegal parking, which can block
other motorists or businesses.

Traffic wardens and an [ Garda Síochána ](/en/justice/law-enforcement/garda-
siochana-national-police-force/) are responsible for enforcing laws relating
to illegal parking. Your local authority is responsible for creating bye-laws
that list the public places in your area where parking fees will be in place.
It also decides the cost of parking fees.

Parking fees vary in Ireland and can be set and adjusted by your local
authority.
