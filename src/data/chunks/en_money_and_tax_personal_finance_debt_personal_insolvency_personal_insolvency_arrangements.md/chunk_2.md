##  Introduction

A Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) is one of 3 debt resolution mechanisms
introduced by the [ Personal Insolvency Act 2012
](http://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2012/act/44/revised/en/html) for people
who cannot afford to pay their personal debts. These mechanisms offer
different solutions to people in different situations.

The Personal Insolvency Arrangement applies to the agreed settlement and/or
restructuring of secured debts up to a total of €3 million (as well as
unsecured debts) over a period of up to 6 years. The cap of €3 million can be
increased by agreement with your secured creditors and the limit of 6 years
can increase to 7 years in some situations.

This page describes how to qualify for a PIA and how the PIA process works.
