Personal Insolvency Arrangements provide for the agreed settlement and/or
restructuring of debts in the case of people who have secured debts up to a
total of €3 million (as well as any unsecured debts) and have no prospect of
being able to pay off their debts in the next 5 years.

You can only avail of a PIA once in your lifetime. You cannot get a PIA if you
are involved in one of the other debt resolution processes introduced by the
Act, or in the [ bankruptcy ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/debt/personal-insolvency/what-is-bankruptcy/) process, or if you have
completed one of these processes within the last 5 years (3 years for a Debt
Relief Notice).

Under the original legislation, you could only get a PIA by agreement of a
specified majority of your secured and unsecured creditors – see [ Main
elements of a PIA ](personal_insolvency_arrangements.en.html#l2864b) below.
However, as noted above, you can now seek a court review if a mortgage lender
rejects your personal insolvency proposal. See ‘Creditors’ meeting’ below for
more detail.

You must be domiciled in the State, or else have been living or had a place of
business in the State within the year before you make your application.
