##  The PIA process

You must make your proposal for a PIA through a Personal Insolvency
Practitioner (PIP). This is a professional who is authorised by the [
Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) ](https://www.isi.gov.ie/) and will act on
your behalf throughout the Personal Insolvency Arrangement.

The ISI has developed standard protocols for use by PIPs when making
straightforward proposals to creditors for a PIA or a Debt Settlement
Arrangement.

You must disclose all details of your financial affairs to the PIP, who will
then advise you whether or not you meet the conditions for a PIA, the
consequences, any alternative options, and the fees that you may have to pay.
You must act in good faith and co-operate fully with the process.

The PIP will help you complete a Prescribed Financial Statement as part of
your application, giving full and honest information about your financial
circumstances.

You must also make a declaration that you have been unable to agree an
alternative repayment arrangement with your creditor(s) or that your
creditor(s) have confirmed in writing that they are unwilling to enter into an
alternative repayment arrangement in respect of your principal private
residence. See ‘Mortgage arrears on your home’ above for specific rules about
mortgage debt.

You will have to give your written consent to enable:

  * The PIP to disclose your personal data to the ISI 
  * The ISI to process your application 
  * The ISI to make any necessary enquiries about you and 
  * The ISI to disclose your personal data to the creditors concerned, as required 

In general, you must act in good faith and co-operate fully with the process.
