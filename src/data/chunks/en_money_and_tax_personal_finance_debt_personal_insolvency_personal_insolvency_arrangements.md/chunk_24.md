###  Varying a Personal Insolvency Arrangement

Personal Insolvency Arrangements may be varied â€“ the procedures are similar to
those for setting up the arrangement.

A creditor or a PIP may apply to the court at any time during the Personal
Insolvency Arrangement to have it ended. The grounds for such an application
are limited and include the following:

  * Your Prescribed Financial Statement has a material inaccuracy or omission that causes a material detriment to the creditor 
  * You did not meet the requirements when you started the process 
  * You did not comply with the terms of the Personal Insolvency Arrangement 
  * You have committed an offence under the personal insolvency legislation since the arrangement came into effect 
  * You are in arrears with your payments for a period of not less than 3 months 

The full list of grounds is in [ Section 122 of the Personal Insolvency Act
2012
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0044/sec0122.html#sec122) .

If you are in arrears with your payments for more than 6 months, the PIA will
be deemed to have failed. This will be recorded in the Register of Personal
Insolvency Arrangements.
