###  **European Union (EU) recognition**

The PIA is an insolvency proceeding that is recognised in other EU states
under EU law. This means that you may get the same protection against
creditors in most other EU countries as you get in Ireland, subject to [ EU
law ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015R0848) .
