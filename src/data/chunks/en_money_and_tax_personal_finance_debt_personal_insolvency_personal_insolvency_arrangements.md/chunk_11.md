###  Pension income

Ongoing pension income receivable by you or an entitlement to a pension lump
sum or income in accordance with the tax code will be treated as an asset or,
as applicable, income for the purposes of a PIA. The terms of the PIA may
provide for payment of some or all of that pension/lump sum or income to
creditors during the PIA period.
