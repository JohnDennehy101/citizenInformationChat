###  Mortgage arrears on your home

In general, you must declare that you have co-operated with your mortgage
lender for at least 6 months in respect of your principal private residence
(your home) in accordance with the Central Bank’s [ Code of Conduct on
Mortgage Arrears ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-arrears/consumer-
protection-codes-and-mortgages/) ; and that, in spite of this co-operation,
you have been unable to agree an alternative repayment arrangement or the
lender has confirmed in writing that it does not wish to enter into such an
arrangement.

This rule does not apply if your Personal Insolvency Practitioner (PIP) – see
below – declares that you would still not be likely to be solvent in 5 years
if you accepted such an alternative repayment arrangement.

If you are facing mortgage arrears, see our [ section on mortgage arrears
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning_a_home/mortgage_arrears/)
for more information.
