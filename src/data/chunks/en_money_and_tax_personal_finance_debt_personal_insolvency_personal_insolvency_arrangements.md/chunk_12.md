###  Pension fund

Your pension fund will be excluded from any PIA if it is a _relevant pension
arrangement_ for the purposes of the Act. Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs) do
not fall into this category and may be included in a PIA. There will be an
onus on you to be transparent in relation to all historical pension
contributions and the PIP will review these.

If a creditor or your PIP considers that you have made excessive pension
contributions in the 3 years before applying for a PIA, an application can be
made to the court to recover these contributions for distribution to your
creditors.
