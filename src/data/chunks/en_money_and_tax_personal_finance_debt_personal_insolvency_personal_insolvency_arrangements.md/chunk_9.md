##  Main elements of a PIA

You must make your proposal for a PIA through a Personal Insolvency
Practitioner (PIP) – see [ The PIA process
](personal_insolvency_arrangements.en.html#le8b6d) below.

Once you have agreed the terms of the PIA proposal with your PIP, you then
need approval from a creditors’ meeting or, failing that, your proposal may be
imposed on your creditors after a court review. See ‘Creditors’ meeting’
below’ for more detail.

A PIA may involve you making regular payments of agreed amounts to your
Personal Insolvency Practitioner, who then distributes them to your creditors
according to the terms of the PIA.

Your creditors may not take any action against you to enforce the debt during
the lifetime of the PIA. If you keep to the terms of the PIA, the rest of your
debt to your unsecured creditors will be discharged. However, when the PIA
ends, you will still be liable for the outstanding amount of your secured
debts, such as your mortgage.
