###  **Public health services**

The State provides public health services. Many public health services are
free of charge, but in some cases, there may be a fee.

The [ Health Service Executive (HSE)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/health-service-
executive/) is responsible for delivering public health services. Sometimes
the HSE provides these services directly and sometimes the HSE funds other
organisations to provide these services.

You are covered by public health services if you have been living in Ireland
for at least one year or if you intend to live here for at least one year.
This is called being [ ordinarily resident in Ireland
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-
public-health-services/#094550) .
