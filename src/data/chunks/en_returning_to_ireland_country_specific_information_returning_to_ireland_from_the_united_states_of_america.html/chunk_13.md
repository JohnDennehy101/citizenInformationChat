###  **Exchanging a driving license**

US driving licenses cannot be exchanged for an Irish license.

To apply for an Irish license, you need to take the [ driver theory test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driver-theory-test/) . You can find out more
on the [ driver theory test website ](https://dttstore.prometric.com/) .

Once you have your learner permit, you only need to take 6 of the [ essential
driver training (EDT) ](https://www.rsa.ie/services/learner-drivers/driving-
lessons/car-driving-lessons-\(edt\)) lessons instead of the usual 12 lessons.
You will need to complete the Road Safety Authorityâ€™s [ application form for
Reduced Essential Driver Training (pdf)
](https://www.ndls.ie/images/Documents/Forms/166459%20RSA%20EDT%20App%20Form_HR_WEB.PDF)
to qualify.

When this is complete, you can [ apply for your driving test
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/travel-and-
recreation/motoring/driving-tests/driving-test/) to get your full Irish
driving licence.
