####  **Normal average rule**

The normal average rule states that you must have a yearly average of at least
10 qualifying contributions paid or credited, from the year you first entered
insurance, to the end of the tax year before you reach pension age.

You need an average of 10 contributions a year to get a minimum pension, and
you need an average of 48 a year to get the maximum pension.

Your yearly average will be rounded to the nearest number. For example, 9.4 is
rounded down to 9 and 47.5 is rounded up to 48.
