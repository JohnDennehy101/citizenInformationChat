####  **Mixed PRSI**

There are special rules if you have mix of full-rate PRSI contributions and
modified-rate contributions. Modified-rate social insurance contributions are
PRSI contributions at Classes B, C and D (paid by civil and public servants).

If you have mixed PRSI contributions and you paid your first full-rate
employment contribution before 6 April 1991 and before you were 56, your entry
into insurance can be the date you first started paying the full rate of PRSI,
if that would be to your advantage.

If you started to pay full-rate PRSI after 6 April 1991, your entry into
insurance is the date you first paid any social insurance.
