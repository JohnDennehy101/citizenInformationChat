##  Carers and the State Pension (Contributory)

If you were a homemaker or took time out of work to care for someone, you may
be entitled to pension caring supports. Depending on your circumstances, you
can use these supports to qualify for a State Pension (Contributory), or to
get a higher rate of State Pension (Contributory).

There are 3 pension caring supports:

  * [ The Homemaker’s Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/homemakers-scheme/) (only used when averaging contributions to calculate SPC rate) 
  * [ HomeCaring Periods Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/homecaring-periods-scheme/) (used when using TCA to calculate SPC) 
  * [ Long-Term Carers Contributions ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/long-term-carers-contributions/) (used when using TCA to calculate SPC) 

You can use Long-term Carers Contributions and HomeCaring Periods Scheme
together, as long as the periods of care don’t overlap.

You don’t need to apply for each scheme separately. You only need to fill in
one application form, called the PCS1 form. This form is not available to
download, but you can ask the Pension Caring Supports Section of the DSP to
send you a form by post (see contact details below).

If you have a MyGovID account, you can also [ apply for the pension caring
support schemes online at MyWelfare.ie

periods/) .
