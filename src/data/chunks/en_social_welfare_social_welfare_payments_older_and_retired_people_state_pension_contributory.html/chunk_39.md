##  Changes to the State Pension (Contributory) 2025

From 1 January 2025, if you were born on or after 1 January 1959, your pension
rate will be calculated using either:

  1. Only the ‘Total Contribution Approach (TCA)' 
  2. A combination of the ‘yearly average method’ and ‘Total Contribution Approach (TCA)’. 

You will get whichever rate is greater.

Read about these methods under ‘How your pension application is assessed’
above.

Over the following 10 years (from 2025 to 2034), the ‘yearly average method’
will be phased out. By 2034, all pensions for people born on or after 1
January 1968, will be calculated using only the TCA.
