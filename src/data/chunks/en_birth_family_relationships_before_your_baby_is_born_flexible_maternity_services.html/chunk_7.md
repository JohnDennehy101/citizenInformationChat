###  **Community midwives**

If you have a normal-risk pregnancy (no complications), a community midwife
can:

  * Provide your antenatal visits, either in a local clinic or your home 
  * Deliver your baby either in hospital (for example, Domino Scheme) or at home (home birth) 
  * Provide postnatal care (care after your baby is born) and answer any maternity questions you may have by phone, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

If you choose to be cared for by community midwives, you will need to have a
routine scan at around 18-22 weeks and a full physical examination to assess
your suitability. If you experience any problems during pregnancy or labour,
you will be immediately transferred back to full hospital care.

Community midwives are self-employed and for this reason, their service is
only available in particular areas and when the midwives have availability.
