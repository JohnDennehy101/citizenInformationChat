###  Home Support Service

If you are aged 65 or over and need support to continue living at home or to
return home following a hospital stay you may be able to get the [ Home
Support Service ](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-older-
people/home-support-service/) . The Home Support Service can provide support
with everyday tasks such as getting in and out of bed, bathing and dressing.

If you are younger than 65 and need support with an illness, you may also be
able to get the home support service, for example if you have early onset
dementia or a disability.

You can find more information about the [ Home Support Service
](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-older-people/home-support-
service/) from the HSE. (The Home Support Service used to be called the Home
Help Service or Home Care Package Scheme).
