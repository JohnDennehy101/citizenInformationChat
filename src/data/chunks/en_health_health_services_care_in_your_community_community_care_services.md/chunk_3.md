##  Who can get community care services?

If you need to access community care services, your doctor (GP) or [ local
health office ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/) can refer you. If
you have a medical card, you can get community care services free of charge.

If you do not have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) , you may also be able to get community services, if
available, but medical card holders may be prioritised.
