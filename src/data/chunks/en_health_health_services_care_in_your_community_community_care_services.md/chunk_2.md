##  What are community care services?

Public health services in your community are sometimes called community care
services and are usually provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE).
Community care services may also be provided by other organisations along
with, or on behalf of, the HSE. The level of services that are available
varies in different parts of the country.

Community care services can include public health nursing, home help,
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody, day care and respite care (see
below). Other community care services include [ social workers

and-language-therapy-services/) and [ dietitians ](/en/health/health-
