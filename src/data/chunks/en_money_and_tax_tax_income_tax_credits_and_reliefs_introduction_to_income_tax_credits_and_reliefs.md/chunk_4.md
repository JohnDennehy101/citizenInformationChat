##  How do tax allowances work?

In some cases, you can get a tax refund for specific expenses, for example,
medical expenses or mortgage interest.

The value of a tax allowance will depend on whether it is allowed at the
highest rate of income tax that you pay or is restricted to the standard 20%
rate. Take the example of a claim of €100. If you pay tax at 40% and you can
claim it at this rate, then it will reduce your tax by €40 (€100 x 40%). If
the highest rate of tax that you pay is 20%, or the relief is restricted to
the standard rate, then the claim of €100 will reduce your tax by €20 (€100 x
20%).
