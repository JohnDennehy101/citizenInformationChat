###  Medical expenses

If you pay medical expenses that are not covered by the State or by private
health insurance, you may claim tax relief on some of those expenses. Find out

credits-and-reliefs/taxation-and-medical-expenses/) and about [ tax relief on
nursing home fees and for dependent relatives ](/en/health/health-

Tax relief is also available for premiums paid for [ health insurance
](/en/health/health-system/private-health-insurance/) and for long-term care
insurance. The insurance company grants this tax relief at source.
