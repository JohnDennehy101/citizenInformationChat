###  One-parent families

If you are caring for a dependent child on your own you can claim the [ Single
Person Child Carer Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax-credits-and-
reliefs/single-person-child-carer-tax-credit/) in addition to your personal
tax credit. There is also an increase in your standard rate tax band. This
means that you can earn more before you start to pay the higher rate of tax.
