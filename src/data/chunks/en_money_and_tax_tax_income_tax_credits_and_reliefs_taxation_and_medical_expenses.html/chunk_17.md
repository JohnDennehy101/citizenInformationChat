####  Receipts

You can only claim for medical expenses if you have receipts to prove your
claim. For dental expenses, your dentist should complete [ Form Med 2 (pdf)
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-
exemptions/documents/med2.pdf) for you to use as a receipt.

Revenue's myAccount service includes a [ receipts tracker service
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-services/services/common/manage-your-
receipts-with-receipts-tracker.aspx) which allows you to store your receipt
details online. If you use this service, you can claim tax relief under the
Real Time Credit service. This means that you can claim for health expenses
and nursing home expenses when you pay them and get increased tax credits in
your next payroll payment from your employer. You can [ make a Real Time
Credit claim using myAccount ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-
reliefs-and-exemptions/real-time-credits/making-real-time-credit-claim.aspx) .

If you don't use the receipt tracker, you must keep your medical receipts for
6 years because Revenue may ask to see them.
