##  Introduction

When you end your marriage (or civil partnership) by judicial separation,
divorce or dissolution or certain cohabitations, the court can decide to
divide your assets with your former partner (for their benefit or for the
benefit of any dependent children). This is to make sure that each person is
provided for.

If you or your spouse, civil partner, qualified cohabitant have been in a
pension arrangement for some time, pensions could be a very significant part
of your family assets. While the [ family home
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-
and-divorce/family-and-shared-home/) is usually the most valuable asset, your
pension can also be considered an asset. This means the court can order that
your pension be divided into whatever shares it considers appropriate. This
decision and instruction from the court is called a _pension adjustment order_
.

Pension rights cannot be shared out without a court order â€“ a [ separation
agreement ](/ga/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/separation-
agreement/) cannot share out pension rights. A judicial separation, divorce or
dissolution or an application for redress following the ending of a
cohabitation is necessary to get a pension adjustment order.

A pension adjustment order will not be made if the applying former spouse or
civil partner has married or remarried.

The law on pension adjustment orders is set out in the:

  * [ Family Law Act 1995 ](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1995_0026.htm)
  * [ Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 ](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/EN_ACT_1996_0033.htm)
  * [ Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 ](http://www.lawreform.ie/_fileupload/RevisedActs/WithAnnotations/HTML/en_act_2010_0024.htm)
