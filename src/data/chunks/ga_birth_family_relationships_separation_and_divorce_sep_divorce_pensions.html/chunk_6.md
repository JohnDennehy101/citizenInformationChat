##  Factors the court will consider

Before a court grants a judicial separation, divorce, dissolution, each spouse
(or civil partner) should have fully revealed all of the financial resources
to the other person. This includes full details of any pension.

The court will consider all of the financial resources available to each
person before it makes a pension adjustment order.

Even if the court does not make a pension adjustment order, it may take the
value of the pension into account when making other financial orders.
