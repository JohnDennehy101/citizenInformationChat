##  Introduction

Cremation is an alternative to [ burial ](/en/death/practical-arrangements-
after-a-death/burials-and-burial-grounds/) when someone dies. All Christian
denominations and most other religions around the world allow cremation. Some
religions (for example, Orthodox Judaism and Islam) do not.

There are a number of crematoria in Ireland (see ‘Further information’ below).
Access to these cremation facilities is not restricted to people living
locally. Anyone may arrange for a cremation to take place in any of these
crematoria.
