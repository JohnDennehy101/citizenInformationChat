###  The ashes

From start to finish, a cremation takes about 5-6 hours. The ashes are
generally available within a day or two. You can make arrangements through the
funeral director or the crematorium for the remains to be buried in the
crematorium's garden of remembrance or placed in a columbarium wall. A
columbarium wall is a structure that contains small niches to hold urns.

Alternatively, the ashes can be removed in an urn which can be supplied by the
funeral director or the crematorium. You can then bury the remains in the
family grave or disperse them. If the dispersal is not on private ground,
permission should be obtained from the appropriate authority. You can scatter
the ashes at sea. The Minister for Transport has the right to make regulations
about the burial for human remains at sea, but has not done so at this point.
They have [ voluntary guidelines

considering this option.
