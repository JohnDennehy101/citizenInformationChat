###  What is care and assistance by the airline?

Free meals and refreshments must be offered depending on how long the waiting
time is. Hotel accommodation must also be offered free of charge where an
overnight stay becomes necessary, as well as transport between the hotel and
the airport. You must be offered 2 free telephone calls, fax messages, or
emails.

If the airline does not give you the above assistance to you and you are
forced to make your own arrangements, you should keep all your receipts. You
are entitled to get reimbursed for your expenses.
