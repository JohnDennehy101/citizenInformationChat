##  Denied boarding

Denied boarding means that the airline has refused to accommodate you on
scheduled flights and charters although you have a valid ticket, correct
documentation (passport, visa etc.), you have confirmed your reservation on
your flight and you have presented yourself for check-in within the required
time limit as specified by the airline.

Denied boarding happens when airlines sell more tickets for a scheduled flight
than there are seats on the aircraft.
