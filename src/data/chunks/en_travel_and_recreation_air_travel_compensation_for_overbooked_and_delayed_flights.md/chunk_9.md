###  Volunteers

Where a flight is overbooked the airline will first call for volunteers to
surrender their confirmed reservations to the airline in exchange for agreed
benefits. The volunteers are also entitled to a choice of:

  * Refund the cost of their ticket within 7 days if not wishing to travel or 
  * Re-routing to their final destination at the earliest opportunity or 
  * Re-routing at a later date at the passengerâ€™s convenience, subject to the availability of seats
