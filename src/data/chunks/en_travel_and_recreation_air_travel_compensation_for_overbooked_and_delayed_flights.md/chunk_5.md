###  Check-in (Confirming your reservation)

When you buy a ticket for air travel, you enter into an agreement with the
airline. One of the terms of this agreement is that you must confirm that you
will be ready to take the flight on the date of travel (confirming your
reservation) and you must present yourself at check-in to demonstrate that you
have a valid ticket and are ready to fly on the date on your ticket.
