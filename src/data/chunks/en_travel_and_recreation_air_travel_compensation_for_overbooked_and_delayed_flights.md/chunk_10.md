###  Non-volunteers

If there are not enough volunteers, the airline may deny boarding to
passengers against their will but must compensate them and offer the
appropriate assistance set out in the law.

You must also be offered a choice of:

  * Refund of the cost of your ticket within 7 days if not wishing to travel or 
  * Re-routing to your final destination at the earliest opportunity or 
  * Re-routing at a later date at your convenience, subject to the availability of seats 

A refund is a full refund of the ticket for the part or parts of the journey
you have not made and for the part or parts you have already made if the
flight is no longer serving any purpose to your original travel plan. When
relevant, it also includes a return flight to your first point of departure at
the earliest opportunity.

If you choose a **refund** , compensation must also be paid. The amount you
are entitled to depends on the distance of the flight that you have not been
allowed to board. See  Compensation  below.

If you choose **re-routing** , the compensation that is paid depends on the
length of delay past the original planned time in arriving at your final
destination. See  Compensation  below.

If you choose to be re-routed as soon as possible then the air carrier must
give you care and assistance whilst you are waiting on your alternative
flight.
