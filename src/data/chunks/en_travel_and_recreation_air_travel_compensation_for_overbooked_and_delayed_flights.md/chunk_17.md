###  Delays over 3 hours

The law does not state that compensation is payable in cases of delay.
However, on 19 November 2009, the European Court of Justice ruled in the cases
of [ Sturgeon v Condor Flugdienst GmbH and Bock and Others v Air France SA
(pdf) ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:62007CC0402)
that compensation similar to that paid for cancelled flights may be payable in
delay situations where the delay exceeds 3 hours. This right was upheld by the
European Court of Justice in further cases on 23 October 2012. The
compensation that is paid depends on the distance of the flight and the length
of the delay past the originally planned time in arriving at your final
destination. See  Compensation  below.

If the airline can prove that the delay was caused by an extraordinary
circumstance which could not have been avoided, even if all reasonable
measures had been taken, no compensation is payable.
