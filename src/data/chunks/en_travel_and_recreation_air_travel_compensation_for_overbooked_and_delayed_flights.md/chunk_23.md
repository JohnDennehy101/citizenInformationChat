###  Downgrading

If you agree to be placed in a lower class than on your original booking, you
are entitled to reimbursement of a percentage of the difference in price. In
other words, if you booked a business or first class seat and the airline
offers you a seat in a lower class it must refund you a percentage of the
ticket price you originally paid. The percentage of the refund is calculated
as follows:

  * 30% of the ticket price for flights of 1,500 km or less or 
  * 50% of the ticket price for intra-EU flights of more than 1,500 km and all other flights between 1,500 and 3,500 km 
  * 75% of the price for all flights greater than 3,500 km
