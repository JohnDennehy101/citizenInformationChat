##  Delayed flights

Whether a delayed flight comes within the terms of the law depends upon the
distance of the route involved and the length of the delay. The following
flights are covered by the law:

  * Delays of 2 hours or more in the case of flights of 1500 km or less 
  * Delays of 3 hours or more in the case of all flights within the EU of more than 1500 km, and all other flights between 1500 and 3500 km 
  * Delays of 4 hours or more in the case of all other flights 

If your delayed flight is covered by the law, free meals and refreshments must
be offered depending on how long the waiting time is. Hotel accommodation must
also be offered free of charge where an overnight stay becomes necessary, as
well as transport between the hotel and the airport. You must be offered 2
free telephone calls, fax messages, or emails.
