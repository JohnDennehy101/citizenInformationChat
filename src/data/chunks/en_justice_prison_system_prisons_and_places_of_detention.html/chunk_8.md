##  Supports for families of prisoners

While there is no national organisation responsible for providing information
or support to families affected by imprisonment, there are several voluntary
organisations that perform such a function:

  * The [ Irish Penal Reform Trust (IPRT) ](http://www.iprt.ie/) is a non-governmental organisation that campaigns for the rights of prisoners. The IPRT does not provide a direct service; however, you can access a range of helpful publications, including [ information for prisoners and their families ](http://www.iprt.ie/practical-information) . 
  * [ Care After Prison ](http://careafterprison.ie/family-support/) is a charity organisation which provides support for offenders, their families and victims of crime. They also work closely with families and loved ones of people under sentence and awaiting sentencing. 
  * The [ Childhood Development Initiative (CDI) ](https://www.cdi.ie/) is a Tallaght-based organisation which works to improve outcomes for children, families and communities in Tallaght and throughout Ireland. 
  * [ St Nicholas Trust ](http://www.stnicholastrust.ie/) is a Cork-based organisation that offers help and support to people affected by imprisonment. 
  * [ Bedford Row Family Project ](http://www.bedfordrow.ie/) is based in Limerick and supports family members affected by the imprisonment. It works towards the re-integration of ex-prisoners into their families, their communities, and society in general.
