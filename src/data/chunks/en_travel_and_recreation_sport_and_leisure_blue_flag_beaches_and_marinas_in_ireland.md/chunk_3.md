##  Rules

A Blue Flag award is awarded to a beach or marina for one season (July to
August) only.

The award of a Blue Flag to a beach depends on compliance with 33 criteria
covering the following aspects:

  * Water quality 
  * Environmental education and information 
  * Environmental management 
  * Safety and services 

There are 29 criteria that a marina must comply with. They cover the same
areas of water quality, environmental education and information, environmental
management, safety, and services. A marina can be part of a larger harbour
with other activities if it is separated from other harbour activities.

The criteria must be adhered to gain a Blue Flag. If the criteria are not
fulfilled during the season or the conditions change, the Blue Flag may be
withdrawn.

The Blue Flag criteria are minimum criteria. A country can choose to have
stricter criteria.
