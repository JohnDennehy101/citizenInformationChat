##  What is Illness Benefit?

Illness Benefit is a weekly payment that you may get if you cannot work
because you are sick or ill.

To get Illness Benefit, you must meet the social insurance (PRSI) conditions –
see ‘How to qualify for Illness Benefit’ below.

You should always apply for Illness Benefit if you are medically certified as
unfit for work. Even if you don’t qualify for the weekly payment, you may get
PRSI credited contributions which can help you qualify for future social
welfare payments.

If you don’t qualify for Illness Benefit or while you are waiting for a
decision on your claim for Illness Benefit, you may get a [ Supplementary
Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) .

Illness Benefit can be paid abroad in some situations. Find out about the [

welfare-payments/) .
