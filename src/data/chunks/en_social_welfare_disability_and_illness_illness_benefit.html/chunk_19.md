###  Paper application form

You must get an Illness Benefit claim form (IB1) and a medical certificate
called a ‘Certificate of incapacity for work’ from your family doctor (GP).
You fill in the IB1 form and freepost it to the Department of Social
Protection - see 'Freepost' address below.

Your GP can provide one medical certificate to cover the duration of your
illness. Some GPs can complete the medical certificate online. If your GP
cannot send it online, you will get a paper medical certificate which you must
fill in with your personal details and freepost it with your IB1 form to the
Department.

You do not pay for the ‘Certificate of incapacity for work’ as the Department
pays the doctor an agreed fee. However, you may have to pay for the doctor to
examine you.

**Hospital certs**

If you are or have been an in-patient in a hospital, you should ask a hospital
doctor to give you a pro forma letter which you can bring to your GP who then
gives you the claim form (IB1) and medical certificate (Certificate of
incapacity for work) with no charge. If you’re still in hospital, a family
member can bring the pro forma letter to your GP on your behalf.
