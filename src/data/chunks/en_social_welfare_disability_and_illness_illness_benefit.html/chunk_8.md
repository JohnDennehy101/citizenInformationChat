##  How long is Illness Benefit paid?

Illness Benefit is paid for a maximum of:

  * 2 years (624 payment days) if you have at least 260 weeks of social insurance contributions paid since you first started work 

**or**

  * 1 year (312 payment days) if you have between 104 and 259 weeks of social insurance contributions paid since you first started work 

If you claim Illness Benefit (IB) within 26 weeks of your last IB claim, it is
treated as one claim. For example, John was getting IB for 6 weeks. He
returned to work for 10 weeks. He got ill again and claimed IB for a further 6
weeks. His IB claims are treated as one claim. This means he has used up 12
weeks of IB.

If you have used up your entitlement to Illness Benefit and return to work,
you must have a minimum of 13 PRSI contributions paid before you can requalify
for Illness Benefit (you must also meet the other qualifying conditions for
Illness Benefit).

If you were getting Illness Benefit for 1 year only, you may requalify with
fewer than 13 contributions, if additional contributions bring your total PRSI
contributions paid up to 260 (for example, if you had 250 contributions when
your Illness Benefit expired, you could work and pay 10 contributions to
requalify).

Before your payment is due to stop, you will be contacted by the Department of
Social Protection (DSP) telling you when your payment will stop and giving you
information on your options, for example:

  * If you are ill and likely to be permanently incapable of work and satisfy the PRSI conditions, you may get [ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/)
  * If you do not get Invalidity Pension and you have a disability that is expected to last for a year or more, you may get a [ Disability Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/)
  * If you do not qualify for any other payments and your income is too low to meet your needs, you may get a [ Supplementary Welfare Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/)
