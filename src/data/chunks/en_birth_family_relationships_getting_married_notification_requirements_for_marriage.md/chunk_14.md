###  Court Exemption Order

In certain special circumstances, for example, in the case of very serious
illness, you may be able to get a Court Exemption Order allowing the marriage
to proceed without the 3-month notification. You should contact either the [
Circuit Family Court
](http://www.courts.ie/offices.nsf/WebCOByJurisdiction?OpenView&Start=1&Count=30&Expand=3#3)
or the [ High Court
](http://www.courts.ie/offices.nsf/WebCOByJurisdiction?OpenView&Start=1&Count=30&Expand=2#2)
in the area in which either of you lives for details on how to proceed.

This is an informal procedure. You may apply in person (without hiring a
solicitor). There is no court charge for an application for a Court Exemption
Order. However, if you hire a solicitor to represent you, you will have to pay
them. The court will require you to show:

  * That there are good reasons for your application 
  * That the granting of such an Exemption Order is in the best interests of the parties to the intended marriage. 

If you are granted a Court Exemption Order, you still have to make
arrangements to meet the Registrar at least 5 days before you get married in
order to make the declaration. This is required before a Marriage Registration
Form can be issued.
