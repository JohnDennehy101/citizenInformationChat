##  What is a Marriage Registration Form?

Couples require a Marriage Registration Form (MRF) to get married in Ireland.
It is like a marriage licence as it gives authorisation for a couple to marry
. As long as there is no _impediment_ (barrier) to the marriage, the Registrar
will give you an MRF. You must then give the MRF to the person who will be
solemnising your marriage. The MRF is also needed to [ register your marriage
](/en/birth-family-relationships/getting-married/registration-of-marriage/)
after you get married.

If you bring all the required documentation (see ‘Documentation you will need’
above) to your marriage notification appointment with the Registrar, the
Registrar may be able to issue the MRF immediately.

If the marriage does not take place within 6 months of the date of marriage
given on the MRF, a new MRF will be required if you still intend to marry. You
will need to repeat the notification process.
