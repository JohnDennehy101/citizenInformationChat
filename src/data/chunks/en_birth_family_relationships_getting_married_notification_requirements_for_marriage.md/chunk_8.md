##  Your marriage notification appointment

When you and your intended spouse meet the Registrar at the Civil Registration
Service office, you will be required to sign, in the Registrar's presence, a
declaration that you are free to marry and know of no lawful impediment to
your proposed marriage.

The Registrar will issue an acknowledgement to both of you and the proposed
solemniser of the marriage confirming the date of receipt of notification.
This does not give you permission to marry. You will also have to pay the
notification fee of â‚¬200.

If all the information required has been supplied and there is no impediment
to the marriage, the Registrar will issue you with a Marriage Registration
Form. This is an important document. You will need this to get married and to
be able to register your marriage.
