###  Postponing your wedding

If you have already started your 3-month notice period but have had to
postpone your wedding, your MRF is valid for 6 months after your original
wedding date.

If your **rescheduled wedding date is within this 6-month period** , your MRF
can be amended. To do this, you should contact the local civil registration
service where you originally served notice of your intention to marry.

If your **rescheduled wedding date is after this 6-month period** , you will
need to contact the office where you originally served notice and give them
your new date of marriage. You must do this at least 3 months before your new
marriage date. You will need to meet with the Registrar again to get a new
MRF. There is no charge for this.
