##  Motorcycles lights

There are rules about the type of lights and reflectors that must be fitted to
your motorcycle. Motorcycle must have the following:

**One headlight** : This is fitted to the front of the motorcycle to light the
road ahead with a white or yellow light. The lamp should light the road ahead
for a distance of 99 metres (325 feet) or 30.5 metres (100 feet) when dipped,
and a reasonable distance for low-powered motorcycles.

**One rear light** : This is fitted to the rear of the motorcycle. This lamp
should provide a red light that is visible for 152 metres (500 feet) when lit.

**One rear reflector** : This is a red reflector that can be seen for a
distance of 99 metres (325 feet) to the rear when the headlights of another
vehicle shine directly on it.

**Registration plate lighting** : This is a white light to illuminate the rear
registration plate so that each letter and number can be easily read from a
distance of 20 metres (65 feet) to the rear.

**Indicators** : These are flashing lights fitted to a motorcycle to let other
road users know that the driver intends to turn right or left.

**Position light** : This is fitted up to 1.5 metres (5 feet) from the ground
to provide white light to the front which is visible for 152 metres (500
feet). This lamp must be 7 watts or less. A position light is only needed if
the motorcycle is not fitted with a headlight or if a side-car is attached.
