##  Introduction

Under Article 15 of the [ Constitution of Ireland ](/en/government-in-
ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) , the [ Oireachtas
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government_in_ireland/houses_of_the_oireachtas/)
must not enact a law which is incompatible with the Constitution. Also, if a
law or part of a law is incompatible with the Constitution, the law or part of
it is invalid. A law passed by the Oireachtas is presumed to be constitutional
until it is proven not to be.
