##  Presidential power

Legislation starts life as a Bill which is passed by both Houses of the
Oireachtas. Every Bill must be signed by the [ Irish President
](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/president-introduction-
to-the-president-of-ireland/) before it can become law. As soon as a Bill has
been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, it is presented to the President
for signature.

Before signing the Bill, the President has the power under Article 26 of the
Constitution to refer the bill to the [ Supreme Court ](/en/justice/courts-
system/supreme-court/) when there is doubt as to whether it is constitutional.
The President must first consult with the Council of State but the decision to
refer the Bill is the President's alone.

The Supreme Court must decide whether or not the Bill conflicts with the
Constitution. If the Supreme Court holds that the Bill is unconstitutional,
the President cannot sign it into law. Under Article 34 of the Constitution,
if a Bill has been referred by the President and the Supreme Court decides
that the Bill is compatible with the Constitution, the constitutionality of
this legislation cannot be challenged subsequently.
