##  Introduction

When a person dies, their property passes to their personal representative.
This is usually a close family member. The personal representative then
distributes the deceased’s person’s assets (money, possessions and property)
in accordance with the law, the will - if there is one - or the [ laws of
intestacy ](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/what-happens-the-deceaseds-
estate#lc8139) if there is no will. These assets are described as [ the
deceased person’s estate ](/en/death/the-deceaseds-estate/dealing-with-the-
deceaseds-estate/) .

You may need access to some of the deceased person's money to pay for funeral
expenses. Many banks have arrangements in place to help pay for funeral
expenses from the deceased person’s account (you should contact the bank to
find out more).

You may also need to get access for living expenses, at least until a social
welfare payment is awarded. There is a [ range of payments provided by the
Department of Social Protection (DSP) ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-
benefits/benefits-and-entitlements-following-a-death/) that are available to
help families during this difficult time.
