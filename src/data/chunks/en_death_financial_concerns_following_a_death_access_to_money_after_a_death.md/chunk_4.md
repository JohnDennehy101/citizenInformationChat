###  Bank accounts in joint names

If the bank account is in the joint names of your loved one and their spouse
or civil partner, the money can usually be transferred into the surviving
spouse or civil partner’s name. You will need the death certificate to do
this.

If the bank account is in the joint names of the deceased person and someone
else, and the bank was given instructions when the account was opened that the
other person was to receive the money on the death of the deceased, the money
can be transferred into the survivor’s name.

If there is an account with more than €50,000, you will also need a letter of
clearance from Revenue allowing the money to be transferred to the surviving
account holder, pending investigations about [ Capital Acquisitions Tax
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/) (CAT). CAT is
a form of inheritance tax. Spouses and civil partners are not liable for CAT
on inheritances from each other.

If you think the deceased person may have had a [ dormant bank account
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/banking/dormant-bank-accounts-in-
ireland/) , you should contact the financial institution at which the account
was held. If that financial institution no longer exists and you want to find
out where to make your enquiry or claim, you should contact the Banking and
Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI).
