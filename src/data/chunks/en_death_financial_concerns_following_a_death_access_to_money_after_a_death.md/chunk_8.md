##  Insurance policies

If an insurance policy names you as the beneficiary, then you may claim it
directly from the insurance company. You need a death certificate. If there is
no named beneficiary, then the proceeds form part of the overall estate of the
deceased and are distributed with the other assets. Find out about [ different
