###  Nationals who can enter Ireland freely, but must meet set conditions to
live here.

In most cases, EEA (this includes the EU and Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein)
and Swiss nationals and their families can enter Ireland and remain for up to
3 months without restriction.

If you are retired and plan to stay more than 3 months, you must have
sufficient resources and sickness insurance to ensure that you do not become a
burden on the Irish State, or you must be employed or self-employed.

EEA and Swiss nationals do not have to make a formal application to live in
Ireland, but if you have family who are not citizens of the EEA or
Switzerland, [ they will have to apply for residence.
