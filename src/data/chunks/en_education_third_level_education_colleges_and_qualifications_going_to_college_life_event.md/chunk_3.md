##  Applying to college

You should check the application procedures and entrance requirements for the
third-level courses you are interested in as soon as possible.

You apply for almost all full-time third-level education undergraduate courses
through the [ Central Applications Office (CAO)
](https://www.cao.ie/index.php) . There are many [ important dates in the CAO
calendar ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/applying-to-college/application-procedures-and-entry-
requirements/#50eadd) every year so donâ€™t miss any deadlines. You can find a
list of the courses on offer and information on how to apply in the [ CAO
handbook ](https://www.cao.ie/handbook.php) .

There are supports available to help you access third-level education if you:

  * Have a [ disability, specific learning difficulty or significant ongoing illness ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-education/applying-to-college/third-level-admissions-scheme-for-students-with-disabilities/)
