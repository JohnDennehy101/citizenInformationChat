###  **Studying abroad**

If you are thinking of [ studying in the UK
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/studying-abroad/studying-in-the-uk-including-northern-ireland/) or [
abroad ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third-level-
education/studying-abroad/studying-outside-ireland/) , you should find out
about the application procedures, length of courses, fees (if applicable) and
living expenses. You may wish to visit a college before you apply. The
application process starts earlier for UK and Northern Irish colleges than in
Ireland. This means you should begin looking at courses at least 12 months
before you plan to start studying.
