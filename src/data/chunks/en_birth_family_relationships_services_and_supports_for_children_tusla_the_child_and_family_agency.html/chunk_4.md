##  Child welfare and protection services

Tusla has responsibility to promote the safety and well-being of children. It
should always be informed when [ a person has reasonable grounds for concern
](https://www.tusla.ie/services/child-protection-welfare/concerns/) that a
child is, or may have been, at risk of being [ abused or neglected
](/en/birth-family-relationships/services-and-supports-for-children/child-
abuse-and-protection/) . Any concern about a potential risk to children posed
by a specific person, even if the children are unidentifiable, should also be
reported.
