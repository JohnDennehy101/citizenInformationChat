##  How much can a candidate spend?

The spending limit is €750,000 per candidate. If a candidate is elected, or
gets more than 25% of the quota in the election, they can be reimbursed up to
€200,000 from the State. Each candidate’s election agent must tell the
Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO) how much the candidate spent.

There are also strict limits on the value of donations to candidates and each
candidate’s election agent must report details of donations to SIPO.

SIPO publishes [ guidelines in advance of a presidential election
](https://www.sipo.ie/documents/english/Presidential-Election-
Guidelines-2018.pdf) . They also publish a report afterwards on the donations
and spending of the presidential election. SIPO’s [ report on the 2018
presidential election ](http://www.sipo.ie/en/Reports/Election-
Reports/Presidential-Election-of-27-October-2011/Report-re-Presidential-
Election.html) is available to read.
