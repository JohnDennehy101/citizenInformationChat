###  Offences under Section 4(2), 4(3) and 4(4)

The most common type of prosecution for drink driving is for driving when over
the prescribed limits for blood/alcohol, urine/alcohol or breath/alcohol.

Proof of the concentration of alcohol in the case of section 4(2)
(blood/alcohol) and 4(3) (urine/alcohol) will be provided by a certificate of
analysis from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety. In the case of a prosecution
under section 4(4) (breath/alcohol) the concentration is proven by a statement
printed from an intoxilyzer, a machine designed to measure the concentration
of alcohol in the breath.
