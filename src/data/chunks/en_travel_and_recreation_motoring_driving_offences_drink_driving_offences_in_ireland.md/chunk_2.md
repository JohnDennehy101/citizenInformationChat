##  Introduction

It is an offence to drive in a public place in Ireland if you are too
intoxicated to have proper control of your vehicle or have consumed more than
the permitted amount of an intoxicant. An intoxicant can be either alcohol or
drugs, or both.

The Garda√≠ carry out roadside breath testing for alcohol levels and saliva
testing for drug levels. It is an offence to refuse to be tested.

If you are convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, you
will be automatically fined and disqualified from driving for a set period of
time. Repeated or serious breaches may result in you being sentenced to
prison.
