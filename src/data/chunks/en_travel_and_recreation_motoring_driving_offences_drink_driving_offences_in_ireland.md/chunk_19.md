###  **Mandatory drug testing of drivers at the scene of a serious accident**

Since midnight on [ Friday 31 May 2024, if you are a driver that has been
involved in a serious car collision, the Gardaí must test you for drugs at the
roadside ](https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/6aad8-minister-chambers-signs-
mandatory-roadside-drug-testing-provisions-into-law/) .

The Gardaí will require you to stay at the roadside until the test shows
either the presence or absence of drugs in your system. This usually takes 8
minutes after giving an oral fluid sample, however the Gardaí may require you
to wait up to 30 minutes.

Gardaí already conduct mandatory testing of drivers for alcohol at the scene
of a crash where someone has been injured, or of a driver who has been injured
and removed to hospital.
