##  Drug driving

It is illegal to drive under the influence of drugs (including prescription
drugs) if your driving is impaired to such an extent that you don’t have
proper control of the vehicle. If convicted of this offence, the minimum
disqualification on a first offence is 4 years and 6 years for a second or
subsequent offence.

For certain drugs – cannabis, cocaine and heroin – it is illegal to drive if
you are over the specified limit, even if your driving is not impaired. If you
are convicted of being over the specified limit, you will be disqualified for
at least one year on a first offence and at least 2 years for second or
subsequent offences. A first offence can be a drink or drug driving offence.
