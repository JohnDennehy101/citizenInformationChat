###  Fire safety awareness

Fire services also raise awareness around fire safety through campaigns on
traditional and social media. They encourage the public to check smoke alarms,
avoid overloaded sockets and to have an escape plan in the event of a fire.

[ National Fire Safety Week ](http://firesafetyweek.ie/) runs in October every
year.
