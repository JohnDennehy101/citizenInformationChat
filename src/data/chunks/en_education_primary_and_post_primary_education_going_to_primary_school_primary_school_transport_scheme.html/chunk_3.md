###  **Proposed changes to school transport scheme**

A review of the school transport scheme has recommended changes to how the
scheme works, so that more students can use buses by 2030.

It recommends:

  * Removing the ‘nearest school’ requirement if there are existing bus routes or if there is enough demand for a new route (at least 10 pupils) 
  * Reducing the distance required for pupils to qualify for the school transport scheme
