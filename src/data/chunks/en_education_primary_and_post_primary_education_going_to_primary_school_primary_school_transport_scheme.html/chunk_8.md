###  Closed or merged schools

The following rules applied in the school year 2011-2012.

  * Children in a closed school area who are living **within 3.2 km** from a ‘school of amalgamation’ are no longer eligible for transport to that school, but they may apply for concessionary transport if there are seats available 
  * Current pupils who are eligible for transport under the Central/Closed School Rule (CSR)*, and who live **3.2 km or more** from their school of amalgamation will remain eligible for the rest of their primary schooling 

*In the school year 2010-2011 when 2 or more primary schools merged, the children for whom the closed school would have been the nearest could only have transport to the school that was the result of the merger. Under the CSR some children living less than 3.2 km from such a ‘school of amalgamation’ were eligible for school transport. 

From the 2012-2013 school year, eligibility based on the CSR ceased for all
new pupils entering primary schools. This may mean that where there is now a
school that is nearer than the school of amalgamation, siblings in some
families may have school transport eligibility to different schools from the
2012-2013 school year onward.
