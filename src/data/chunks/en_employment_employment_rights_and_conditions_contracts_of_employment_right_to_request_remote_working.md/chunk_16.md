##  Changing your remote working arrangement

You and your employer have the option to change the arrangement after it has
been approved, either before or after it begins.

Changes must be agreed in writing. They could include:

  * Postponing the arrangement and agreeing on a new start date 
  * Shortening or changing the length of the arrangement 
  * Changing details of the arrangement in a way that you both agree to
