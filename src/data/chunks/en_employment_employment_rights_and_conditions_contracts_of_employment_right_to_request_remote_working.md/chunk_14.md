##  What your employer should consider

Your employer should consider your request based on:

  * Their own needs (the business needs) 
  * Your needs and reasons for the request 
  * The WRC Code of Practice 

Your employer may consider the suitability of the role and your suitability
for remote working. Considerations include:

  * If the duties can be done remotely 
  * If on-site work is necessary for certain tasks 
  * If technological solutions are available for remote work 
  * Any health and safety concerns
