###  **What is remote working?**

Remote working is an arrangement where instead of going to your employerâ€™s
workplace, you do some or all of your work from another location. You still
work the same hours and duties as if you were physically at the workplace.

This page summarises the duties and responsibilities set out in the Code of
Practice. You and your employer can agree on more favourable arrangements than
what is set out in the legislation.
