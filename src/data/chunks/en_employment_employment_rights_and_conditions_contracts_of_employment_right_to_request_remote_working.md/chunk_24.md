###  **Resolving issues**

If you have concerns that your request has not been properly considered
according to the law and the WRC Code of Practice, you should try to solve the
issue informally with your employer first.

If you cannot resolve it informally, you can raise a formal complaint with
your employer.

If there is a collective agreement between a [ trade union
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/industrial-relations-and-trade-unions/trade-unions/) and an
employer, they should use those procedures for discussing grievances.
