##  The Charter and national law

The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union applies directly to
Ireland. When the Irish government is implementing an EU law, it must do so in
accordance to the rights contained in the Charter.

In Ireland, examples of when the Charter may be relevant include if:

  * The Oireachtas is legislating to transpose an EU Directive. EU Directives are [ EU laws ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-law/european-laws#l66355) that only come into effect when corresponding laws are passed by the national parliament. This means that each member state may interpret some aspects of the Directive differently, or might fail to correctly transpose the central laws of the Directive. 
  * A [ European Arrest Warrant ](/en/justice/arrests/extradition-to-and-from-ireland/) is executed. 
  * A benefit or health service is applied for that is based on a personâ€™s status as an EU worker. 
  * The right to [ free movement ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/freedom-of-movement-in-the-eu/) is involved. 

If an EU law is disobeyed in Ireland in a way that interferes with the rights
of citizens as set out in the Charter, this could be dealt with by:

  * The [ European Commission ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-commission/) referring the matter to the [ Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-institutions/european-court-of-justice/)
  * A citizen referring the matter to the courts in Ireland, and to the CJEU if necessary.
