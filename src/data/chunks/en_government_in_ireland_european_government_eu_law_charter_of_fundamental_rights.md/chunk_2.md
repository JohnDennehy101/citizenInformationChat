##  Introduction

The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union brings together the
most important personal freedoms and rights enjoyed by citizens of the EU into
one legally binding document. The Charter was declared in 2000, and came into
force in December 2009 along with the Treaty of Lisbon.

The purpose of the Charter is to promote human rights within the territory of
the EU. Many of the rights that are contained in the Charter were previously
set out in:

  * The EU Treaties 
  * The European Convention on Human Rights 
  * Case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union 
  * National constitutions (for example, the [ Constitution of Ireland ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-constitution-1/constitution-fundamental-rights/) ) 

The Charter has the same legal power as an EU Treaty. This means that it is
superior to Irish domestic law. However, it only applies when Irish bodies
(particularly the Irish Government) are implementing [ European Union law
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/eu-law/how-eu-law-works/) .
