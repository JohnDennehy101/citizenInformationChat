##  The Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)

The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was signed in 1950. It was
proclaimed by the Council of Europe, and is overseen by the European Court of
Human Rights in Strasbourg.

Ireland is a founding member of the Council of Europe and signed the ECHR. But
the ECHR only became part of Irish law when the Oireachtas passed the [
European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/act/20/enacted/en/print.html) . This
is because the ECHR does not have a direct effect in Irish law.

All of the ECHR rights are included in the Charter. The Charter however
addresses some modern issues that are not included in the ECHR (for example,
human cloning, data protection).

The box below outlines some of the similarities and differences between the
Charter and the ECHR:

|  **European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)** |  **Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union**  
---|---|---  
First proclaimed  |  1950 by the Council of Europe  |  2000 by the European Union   
Came into effect in Ireland  |  European Convention of Human Rights Act 2003. Before this, the ECHR and the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights were not binding in Ireland but were referred to by the courts.  |  In December 2009 along with the Treaty of Lisbon. The Charter has the same legal status as an EU treaty and therefore has direct effect in certain areas.   
When is it applied in Ireland?  |  Irish law must be compatible with the ECHR. This applies when laws are being written or changed and when the courts are interpreting Irish laws.  Every government department, local authority and public institution must perform its duties in a way that satisfies Irelandâ€™s obligations under the ECHR.  |  The Oireachtas must consider the Charter when _transposing_ EU directives into Irish law, or passing legislation following an EU decision or regulation.  For citizens, the Charter only applies where the case involves EU law.
