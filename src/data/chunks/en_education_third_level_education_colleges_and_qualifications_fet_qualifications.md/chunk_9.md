###  Protection for learners

QQI will only validate programmes that provide protections for the learner.

If a provider has a programme of 3 months or more and charges a fee, they must
ensure you can complete the course you have started if they stop offering the
programme for any reason. The provider must also have a reserve fund and be
adequately insured.
