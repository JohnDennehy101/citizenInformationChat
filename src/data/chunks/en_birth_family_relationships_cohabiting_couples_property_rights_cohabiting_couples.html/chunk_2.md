##  What is a cohabiting couple?

A _cohabiting couple_ is a couple that lives together in an intimate and
committed relationship, who are not married to each other and not in a civil
partnership. Cohabiting couples can be opposite-sex or same-sex. A cohabiting
relationship can continue to be ‘intimate’ even if it is not sexual.

In Ireland, cohabiting couples have certain rights in relation to property,
custody of children, maintenance and inheritance. To qualify for these rights,
you must be cohabiting **for at least 5 years** (or **2 years** if you have
dependent children together).

The law on the rights of cohabitants is set out in the [ Civil Partnership and
Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/act/24/enacted/en/html) .
