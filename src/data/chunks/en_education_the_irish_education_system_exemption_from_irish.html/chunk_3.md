##  Who can apply for an exemption from studying Irish?

If you are a parent or guardian, you can apply for your child to be exempt
from the study of Irish if you think they meet the criteria. Your child must
be enrolled in an English-medium mainstream school. A student over 18 years of
age can also apply for an exemption.

Your child will only be considered for exemption from studying Irish in
exceptional circumstances.

The decision to exempt a student is made by the principal of the school
following discussion with a studentâ€™s parents or guardians, the class teacher,
special education teachers and the student themselves.

If a child is granted an exemption, they can choose not to use the exemption
and take part in Irish classes or examinations. However, they do not lose the
right to use the exemption in the future.
