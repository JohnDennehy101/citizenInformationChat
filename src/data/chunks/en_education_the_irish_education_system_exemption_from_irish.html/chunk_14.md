##  Irish language requirements for third-level courses

**Exemption from Irish at school**

Some third-level courses require a student to have a certain mark in Irish at
the Leaving Certificate examination. If you have been exempted from Irish at
school, you may be exempted from the third level requirement for a course.
However, this is a matter for each individual college.

If you want to do a particular course, you should check with the college that
it allows exemptions from Irish for the course you want to apply for. You can
also check the [ CAO website ](https://www.cao.ie/) for information about
language exemptions.

If you are applying for a third-level course through the Central Applications
Office (CAO), you should send a copy of the exemption certificate with your
CAO application form.

**Exemption from Irish at third-level**

If you didnâ€™t get an exemption from Irish in school under the rules set by the
Department of Education, you can still apply to the third-level institute for
an exemption from Irish in their entry level requirements. The third-level
institute will decide on your application.

The college may also ask you to complete an exemption application form and to
submit supporting documentation. You should check with the individual college
for details on how to apply for an exemption.
