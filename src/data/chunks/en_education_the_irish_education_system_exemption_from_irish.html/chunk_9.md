###  Exemption for special schools and special classes in mainstream schools

A student is considered exempt and does not need to apply for a certificate of
exemption if they are:

  * A student in a special school or a special class in a mainstream school 
  * A student who has previously enrolled in a special school or class 
  * A student who is eligible and has been recommended to enrol in a special school or class. 

Your child’s school can make decisions about the Irish language learning needs
of a student in a special class. However, schools are expected to provide
students with opportunities to take part in Irish language and cultural
activities as much as possible.

Education’s [ FAQ for parents
