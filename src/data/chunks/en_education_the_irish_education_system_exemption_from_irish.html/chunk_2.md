##  What is an exemption from studying Irish?

Irish is one of the core subjects in the school curriculum in Ireland. All
students must study Irish unless they are given an exemption from studying the
subject. If you get an exemption, you do not have to study Irish at school.

You can apply for an exemption from studying Irish in primary and secondary
school.

You can only apply if English is the main language of instruction in your
school. You cannot get an exemption from Irish in a school where Irish is the
main language of instruction.

An exemption is only given in certain circumstances. The student must meet
certain criteria – see ‘Who can apply for an exemption from studying Irish’
below.

Detailed information about the exemption from studying Irish in school, is set
out in the Department of Education’s Circular [ 54/2022
](https://www.gov.ie/en/circular/28b2b-exemptions-from-the-study-of-irish-
primary/) (for primary schools) and [ Circular 55/2022
](https://www.gov.ie/en/circular/f33d5-exemptions-from-the-study-of-irish-
post-primary/) (for post-primary schools). An exemption from the study of
Irish can only be made under the rules outlined in the Circular in place at
the time of application. You can find more information about the rules
governing the exemption from Irish before September 2022 from the Department
of Education.
