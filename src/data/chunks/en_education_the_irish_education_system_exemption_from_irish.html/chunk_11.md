###  Evidence of a disability

Psychological assessments and cognitive ability (IQ) scores are no longer
needed when applying for exemption from the study of Irish.

If the exemption is sought on the grounds of a literacy difficulty, your child
must present with significant and persistent learning difficulties despite
having had access to a differentiated approach to language and literacy
learning over time. The school also must have evidence of your child having a
standardised score at or below the 10th percentile in at least one literacy
attainment test in either word reading, reading comprehension or spelling.
