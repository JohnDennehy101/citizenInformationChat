##  How to appeal a decision

If you do not agree with the decision to refuse an exemption for your child,
you can appeal the school’s decision to the Irish Exemptions Appeal Committee
(IEAC) using the [ official appeals form
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/irish-exemption/#appealing-a-decision) . You
must appeal within 30 days from the date you are notified in writing of the
school’s decision.

The Committee will consider the grounds given for the refusal using the
Department’s criteria for exemption and any supporting documentation the
school had at the time of the decision.

You can get more information and an Irish exemption appeal form to appeal the
decision on [ gov.ie ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/irish-exemption/)

You can reapply for an exemption if it was refused. You should discuss with
the school if it has the correct evidence to support your application.
