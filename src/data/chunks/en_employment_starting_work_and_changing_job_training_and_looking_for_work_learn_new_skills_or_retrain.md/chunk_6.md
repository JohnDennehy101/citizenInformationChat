##  Financial supports for training or education

The [ Back to Education Programme ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-
to-education-programme/) can support if you are getting a social welfare
payment and you want to take up a second-level or third-level course.

The [ Part-Time Education Option
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/back-to-education/part-time-education-option/) allows you to keep
your Jobseeker's Allowance or Jobseeker's Benefit and attend a part-time day
or evening course.

The [ Education, Training and Development Option
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/back-to-education/education-training-and-development-option/) allows
you to keep your jobseekerâ€™s payment and attend a course not covered by the
standard Back to Education Allowance such as a personal development course.
