##  Higher education courses

The [ Springboard+ Programme ](/en/education/third-level-education/applying-
to-college/springboard/) provides free higher education places if you are
unemployed and looking to return to the workforce. There is a range of part-
time courses from certificate to masterâ€™s degree levels - levels 6 to 9 on the
[ National Framework of Qualifications ](https://www.qqi.ie/what-we-do/the-
qualifications-system/national-framework-of-qualifications) .

[ Apprenticeships ](/en/education/further-education-and-
training/apprenticeships/) offer you a mixture of on-the-job training with an
employer and off-the job training in a training centre. An apprenticeship
generally lasts for 2 to 4 years.
