##  Making a complaint about notice or pay

If you have a complaint or dispute about your notice or pay during the notice
period, you should begin by trying to sort it informally with your employer.

If you are unable to resolve the complaint informally, you can make a
complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).

You must use the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/Complaints_Disputes/Refer_a_Dispute_Make_a_Complaint)
. All complaints must be made within 6 months. This time limit can be
increased to 12 months if you can show there was a “reasonable cause” for the
delay.
