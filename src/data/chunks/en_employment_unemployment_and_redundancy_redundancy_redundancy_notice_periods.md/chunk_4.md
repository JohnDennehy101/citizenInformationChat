##  My employer says I do not have to work my notice

You still get the same paid notice if your employer says you do not have to
work your notice period.

Not having to work your notice period could mean either:

  * You are paid as usual until the end of your notice period, but you do not have to work 
  * You get all your notice pay at once and your employment ends straight away (called ‘pay in lieu of notice’) 

Your employer will tell you if they are giving you pay in lieu of notice or
simply paying you as normal to the end of your notice period.
