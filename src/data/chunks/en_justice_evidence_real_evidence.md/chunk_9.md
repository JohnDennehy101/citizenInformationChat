###  Forensic evidence

Forensic evidence is material or traces of material that have been analysed by
a forensic science laboratory. Forensic evidence is collected by members of
the Garda√≠ who are specially trained to do this. They must ensure that samples
are not compromised or contaminated when they are collected and stored.

Forensic science laboratories closely examine materials such as paint, glass,
soil, hair, fibres, firearm residues, fire accelerants and footprint samples.
These samples may have been taken from the scene of the crime or may have been
found on the [ victim ](/en/justice/victims-of-crime/your-rights-as-a-victim-
of-crime/) or the suspect.

Forensic evidence has many uses, for instance:

  * The presence of a material in itself may be significant, for example, the presence of firearms residue on a suspect's clothes 
  * Samples of materials may be matched, for example, fibres found on the suspect's jumper match the victim's blouse 
  * Unique marks may be identified, for example, footprints 

Forensic evidence tends to prove that a suspect was at the scene of the crime.
For example, if a window was broken by a burglar to get into a house, the
suspect's clothing will be examined for small glass fragments. The window will
also be examined for fibres that may have come from the burglar's clothing.
There may also be [ DNA evidence ](/en/justice/evidence/dna-evidence/) .

When forensic evidence is introduced in court, it is usually be explained by
an expert - a forensic scientist. The scientist explains what was done with
the sample and how it was analysed. The scientist can then explain the
laboratory's findings.
