###  Photographs

Photographs can be introduced as evidence of what they show. For example, in a
murder trial, photographs can be introduced as evidence of the position and
state of the deceased's body when it was found.

A photographâ€™s authenticity must be proven before it can be admitted as
evidence. The photographer must prove that they took the photograph, and the
person who processed it must make a statement saying that the photograph is
untouched.

Photographs do not need to be taken by a professional photographer to be
admitted as evidence. For example, in a civil case, photographs you have taken
of damage done to your car in a road traffic accident will be allowed (as long
as you are available to give evidence in court about when and how you took the
photographs).
