###  A person’s appearance and behaviour

A person’s physical appearance and their characteristics can be used as real
evidence. For example, in a [ personal injuries ](/en/justice/civil-
law/injuries-resolution-board/) case the injured person can show the judge a
scar they got as a result of the incident. Animals can also be produced to
assess their temperament.

The demeanour of a witness when giving [ oral evidence
](/en/justice/witnesses/rules-about-giving-evidence/) is considered real
evidence. The judge can take this into account when deciding if this evidence
is credible.
