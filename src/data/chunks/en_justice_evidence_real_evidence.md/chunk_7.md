###  Out-of-court inspection

A _view_ is an out-of-court inspection of a place or an object that canâ€™t be
brought into court. For example, the judge (and the jury if it is a criminal
case) and the people involved in the case can leave the court to inspect a
large machine or a motor vehicle that is of importance to the case.

A view is admissible as evidence in a [ criminal case ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) or a [ civil case ](/en/justice/civil-
law/taking-and-appealing-a-civil-case/) . However, in most cases, it is not
necessary to leave the court to examine a place or an object as a photograph
or a video recording of the place or object will be accepted in court.
