###  Energy efficiency and warmer homes

There will be a new multi-annual National Retrofit Programme. It is expected
that this scheme may create up to 5,000 jobs in 2010. The local authorities
will get extra funding to retrofit the social housing stock. It is intended
that over one million homes will have been retrofitted by 2025.

â‚¬50m of the yield from the new carbon tax will be used to fund measures such
as helping to make homes warmer for households at risk of fuel poverty.

A vouched fuel allowance scheme will be developed. This will aim to offset the
increased costs generated by the proposed carbon tax for low-income families
who are dependent on certain fuels to heat their homes.
