###  Announcement on reform of income tax system in 2011

The Minister for Finance announced that a new system of two charges on income
would be introduced in 2011.

A new Universal Social Contribution will replace employee PRSI, the health
levy and the income levy. It will be paid by everyone at a low rate on a wide
base as a collective contribution to public services.

Income tax will apply on a progressive basis to those with higher incomes.
