##  National Solidarity Bond

A new National Solidarity Bond is proposed to help the financing of the
capital investment programme underlying the 2010 Budget (that is, the bond
will not be used to fund additional spending).

The bond will be in addition to the current range of “State Savings” products
(savings bonds, savings certificates, prize bonds, national instalment savings
and the Post Office deposit account).

The main features of the new bond will be:

  * Investors can choose to invest for a five-, seven- or ten-year period 
  * Interest will be paid annually 
  * Investors will be entitled to a final redemption bonus on maturity as an incentive to leave their funds invested; the bonus will be different for each investment period 
  * Full details of the tax treatment of the bond will be provided in the Finance Bill 2010 
  * It will be possible to invest in the bond by lump sum or by occasional payments 

The bond will be available through the following channels:

  * Internet 
  * Telephone 
  * Direct debit 
  * At your local Post Office 

The bond will be sold by An Post on behalf of the National Treasury Management
Agency (NTMA). Further details will be announced by the NTMA early in 2010.
