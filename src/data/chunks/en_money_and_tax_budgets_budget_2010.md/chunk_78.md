###  Employers and self-employed

  * â‚¬36m will be allocated to an Employers Job Incentive Scheme giving PRSI exemption to encourage employers to take on employees. This will bring the total places available for the unemployed to over 180,000. 
  * The existing scheme providing a three-year exemption from tax on the income and gains of new start-up companies will be extended to include companies who commence trading in 2010. 
  * A credit review system will examine the credit policies and practices of the banks for all SME sectors. It will pay particular attention to sectors such as tourism where particular stresses have been reported. 
  * Under the Employer Jobs (PRSI) Incentive Scheme, where an employer creates a new job and takes on a person who has been unemployed for 6 months or more, the employer will be fully exempted from the liability to pay PRSI for the first year of that employment. This will give employers an 8%-10% saving on employment costs for each new job created. Full details will be announced early in 2010.
