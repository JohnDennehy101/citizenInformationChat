###  Restriction of reliefs

The restriction of income tax relief for high income earners* is being amended
for 2010 and subsequent tax years to achieve an effective rate of income tax
of 30% for people who were subject to the full restriction. PRSI and relevant
levies will also apply. The entry level threshold for the restriction will now
occur at adjusted income levels of €125,000 (was €250,000) and the full
restriction will apply at €400,000 (was €500,000).

*This restriction of relief measure was introduced in Budget 2006, and came into operation from 1 January 2007. It limits the use of tax breaks by those with high incomes. It is based on restricting the amount of specified reliefs which a person can use to reduce their tax bill in any one year.
