###  Inspection of residential facilities for children with disabilities

Funding is being provided in 2010 to implement an independent registration and
inspection system of residential services for children with disabilities. The
registration and inspection system will be implemented by the Social Services
Inspectorate in the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and will
start by the end of 2010.

Detailed proposals will also be brought to Government early in 2010 for the
protection of vulnerable adults with disabilities who are in residential
services provided by, or on behalf of, the State.
