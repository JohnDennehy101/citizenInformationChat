###  Teachers

The provision for teacher in-service education support will be €29.79m
compared with a 2009 estimate of €40m. Restructuring of existing services will
continue in 2010. Services will be focused on priority areas including special
educational needs, child protection guidelines training, implementation of new
procedures for underperforming teachers, and Project Maths.

The allocation for pre-service teacher education is being reduced by €3m and
will be achieved by reducing the number of post-graduate conversion places.

The supply teacher scheme at primary level will cease from the start of the
2010/11 school year. Normal substitution arrangements which apply to primary
schools generally to cover teacher absences will be used to cover substitution
in those schools that participated in the scheme.

From the start of the 2010/11 school year, the maximum number of uncertified
sick leave days allowed in the school year for teachers in primary, secondary
and community and comprehensive schools will be reduced to 7 days. This is the
same number of days available for teachers in vocational schools and community
colleges.
