###  Flood relief

In excess of â‚¬70 million will be provided over the remainder of 2009 and into
2010 to help those affected by recent flooding and to fund work to minimise
the risks of future incidents. The review of investment priorities which will
shortly be published will also provide for continued substantial investment in
flood relief.
