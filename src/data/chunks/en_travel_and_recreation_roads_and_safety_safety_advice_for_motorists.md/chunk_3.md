when driving.

**When driving you should:**

  * Drive at a speed appropriate to the road and weather conditions, the volume of traffic and the likelihood of hazards. Speed limits are the maximum speed you can drive on a stretch of road in good conditions. 
  * Never drink or take drugs and drive. Alcohol and drugs affect your judgement, vision, coordination, and reaction time. 
  * Wear your seatbelt. By law, every passenger in the car must also wear a seatbelt. 
  * Take a break from driving if you feel tired â€“ a nap of 15 to 20 minutes can help. 
  * Never use a hand-held mobile phone. Any distraction when driving can be dangerous. 
  * Use your dipped headlights to see and be seen if visibility is poor. 
  * Only use fog lights when there is fog or falling snow. Switch them off when conditions improve.
