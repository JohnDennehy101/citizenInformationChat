##  Before you drive

Before you drive your car, there are certain documents that you must have in
place. You should also check that the car is safe to drive (roadworthy). Keep
up to date with the general maintenance of your car. When driving a car, be
aware of the way you drive, the dangers on the road and your obligations as a
road user.

**Before you drive you must ensure the following:**

  * The car is [ insured ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-insurance/) and [ taxed ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/motor-tax-and-insurance/motor-tax-rates/) . 
  * The car has passed its [ NCT test ](/en/travel-and-recreation/vehicle-standards/national-car-test/) . 
  * All discs are displayed on the windscreen. 
  * You must also hold a valid [ driving licence ](/en/travel-and-recreation/motoring/driver-licensing/learner-driving-permits-for-cars-and-work-vehicles/) . 

Check all lights and indicators and ensure your windscreen is clean and free
from anything that might obstruct your vision. Keep your windscreen washer
fluid topped up. Check your horn is working. Check that the brakes are
working. You need to check regularly the brake and engine oil levels, the tyre
pressure and the condition of your tyres. Getting your car serviced when it’s
due is always a good idea. Check your car’s handbook for the next service
date.
