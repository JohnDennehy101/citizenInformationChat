You must be living in Ireland and intend to live here for a minimum of one
year ( [ ordinarily resident ](/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-public-
health-services#la6e34) ).

If you have a [ medical card ](/en/health/medical-cards-and-gp-visit-
cards/medical-card/) you should have [ reduced prescription charges
](/en/health/drugs-and-medicines/prescription-charges-for-medical-card-
holders/) and so you are not eligible for the Drug Payment Scheme.

The scheme is based on the monthly cost of prescription drugs, medicines and
certain appliances for you and:

  * Your spouse or partner 
  * Your children if they are aged under 18 (or under 23 if in full-time education) 
  * A family member with a physical or intellectual disability or mental illness who cannot maintain themselves fully. You need to include a medical report for the family member who cannot maintain themselves.
