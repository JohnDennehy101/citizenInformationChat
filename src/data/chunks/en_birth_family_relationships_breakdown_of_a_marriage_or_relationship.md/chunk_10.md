##  Grandparents and grandchildren

Grandparents play an important role in their grandchildâ€™s life. However, some
grandparents have difficulty seeing their grandchildren and spending time with
them. They can find themselves excluded from the lives of their grandchildren,
and this can be very upsetting for them and for the children involved. This
can happen for many reasons, for example, if there is a breakdown in the
relationship between the grandparent(s) and parent(s).

Grandparents do not have automatic rights in relation to their grandchildren,
but there are steps you can take to improve your level of contact with them.
