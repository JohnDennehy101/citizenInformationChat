####  Children

Where there are children, issues of [ custody ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/cohabiting-couples/custody-of-children-cohabiting-couples/) , [
guardianship ](/en/birth-family-relationships/cohabiting-couples/guardianship-
and-cohabiting-couples/) and [ access to the children ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/cohabiting-couples/access-to-children-cohabiting-couples/) are
likely to arise. Also, while unmarried parents do not have a financial
responsibility to maintain each other, both parents are responsible for the [
maintenance of their children ](/en/birth-family-relationships/parenting-
alone/maintenance-lone-parents/) .
