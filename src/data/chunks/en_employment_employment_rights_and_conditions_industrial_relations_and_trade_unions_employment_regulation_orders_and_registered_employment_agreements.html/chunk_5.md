###  How an ERO comes into effect

The ERO proposal is drawn up by a [ Joint Labour Committee (JLC)
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/industrial-relations-and-
trade-unions/joint-labour-committees/) . The JLC can be set up to agree on
rates of pay and conditions of employment for vulnerable workers in sectors
that are not otherwise represented.

Then, the JLC’s proposal must be adopted by the Labour Court. If adopted by
the Labour Court, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will sign
an ‘Order’, giving the proposal statutory effect.
