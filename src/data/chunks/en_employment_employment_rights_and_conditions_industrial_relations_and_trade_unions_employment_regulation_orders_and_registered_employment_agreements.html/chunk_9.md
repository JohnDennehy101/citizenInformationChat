###  How an SEO comes into effect

An SEO begins as a request to the Labour Court to review issues such as the
pay, pension or sick pay scheme for workers in a particular sector.

The request to the Labour Court can be made separately or jointly by
organisations that **substantially** represent employers or workers, such as a
trade union.

Then, the Labour Court can recommend the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and
Employment to make an SEO. When the Minister signs an SEO, the Labour Courtâ€™s
recommendations become legally binding across the sector.
