##  Sectoral Employment Orders

A Sectoral Employment Order (SEO) can set the pay, pension or sick pay scheme
for workers in a particular sector, such as construction. The law on SEOs is
set out in the [ Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015
](https://revisedacts.lawreform.ie/eli/2015/act/27/revised/en/html) .

The SEO has a dispute resolution procedure. It requires employees to raise
individual disputes with their employer, at local level, first. The employer
must respond within 5 working days. If it is not resolved, the dispute can be
referred to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). WRC decisions can be
appealed to the Labour Court.
