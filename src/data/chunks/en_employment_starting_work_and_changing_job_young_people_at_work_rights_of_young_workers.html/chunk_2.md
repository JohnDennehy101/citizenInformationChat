##  Who are ‘young workers’?

If you are between 14 and 18 and you work for an employer, you are a ‘young
worker’ entitled to certain rights and protections.

The law sets out different rules for young workers, depending on your age.
Workers aged 14 and 15 are classed as ‘children’. Workers aged 16 and 17 are
classed as ‘young persons’.
