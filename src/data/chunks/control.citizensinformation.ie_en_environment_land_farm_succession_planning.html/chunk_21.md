##  What happens when I inherit a farm?

If you inherit a farm, you may have to pay [ Capital Acquisitions Tax
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/capital-
taxes/capital-acquisitions-tax/) and [ Stamp Duty
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-
home/stamp-duty/) . There may be different tax reliefs available to you to
reduce these taxes. See [ Farm transfer and taxes
](https://control.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/farm-succession-
planning/#96dc34) below.

You may also have to:

  * Change the registration details of the herd 
  * Manage any outstanding payments from schemes and transfer scheme entitlements
