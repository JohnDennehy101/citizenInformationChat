###  **Get advice**

You should talk to your [ farm advisor
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/b41a6-farm-advisory-
system/?referrer=https://www.gov.ie/farmadvisor/#find-a-farm-advisor) first.
They have a good understanding of how your farm business works and have
experience of other farm transfers so will be able to help with the process.
They will also let you know how the transfer will affect any [ schemes
](/en/environment/land/farming-grants-and-schemes/) and at what stage you will
need a solicitor and accountant.
