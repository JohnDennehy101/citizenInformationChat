##  Rules

You can participate in the PTJI Scheme if you get part-time work for less than
24 hours per week and immediately before that you were:

  * On long-term [ Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) for at least 390 days (15 months). Days of unemployment on [ Jobseeker's Benefit (JB) ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) or the [ Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment ](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/covid19-pandemic-unemployment-payment/) count towards the 390 days if you were getting JB immediately before you got Jobseeker’s Allowance. 
  * Getting a weekly JA payment of at least €147 if you are single or €239.70 if you are getting an increase for a qualified adult. 

You must also undertake to remain on the scheme for 2 months. You can do more
than one part-time job but the total hours worked must be less than 24. The
part-time job you get must be likely to last at least 2 months and be
insurable at [ PRSI Class A or J ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-

work you may not return to the PTJI Scheme at the end of your full-time work
no matter how short it was. Self-employed people are not eligible for this
scheme.
