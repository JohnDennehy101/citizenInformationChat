###  Secondary benefits

No secondary benefits are paid while you are on the Part-Time Job Incentive
scheme. You can keep your medical card while you are on the PTJI scheme
regardless of your earnings for a maximum of 3 years. You can continue to
qualify for [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/rent-supplement/) but your earnings will be assessed against your
supplement.
