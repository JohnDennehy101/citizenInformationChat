##  Fingerprints and other samples

Your fingerprints, photographs, saliva, hair and certain other samples can
generally be taken without your consent. Your written consent is required
before the following samples can be taken and they must be taken by a doctor
or dentist as appropriate:

  * Blood, urine or pubic hair 
  * A swab from your genital region or any body opening, other than your mouth 
  * A dental impression 

The consent must be signed and recorded in the custody record.

Any refusal to provide a [ DNA ](/en/justice/evidence/dna-evidence/) or other
sample without good reason may be later used in court against you.
