###  Medical treatment

The Garda in charge must get a doctor or send you to a hospital if you are:

  * Injured 
  * Under the influence of alcohol or drugs and cannot be woken up 
  * Unable to respond normally to questions or conversation (not due to the influence of alcohol alone) 
  * Suffering from a mental illness 
  * In need of medical attention 

If you need medication for a heart condition, diabetes, epilepsy or another
potentially serious condition, the Garda in charge should get it for you if
they think it is necessary.

If you are sent to a hospital, this must be recorded. Any instructions given
by a doctor about your medical care and steps to be taken to comply with the
instructions should also be recorded.

If you ask to be examined by a doctor of your choice at your own expense, the
member in charge of the station must make the necessary arrangements.

If you are removed to hospital, an immediate relative and any other person
required to be notified shall be informed.
