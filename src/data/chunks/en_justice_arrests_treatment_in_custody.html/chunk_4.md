##  Garda duty to keep records

The Garda√≠ must keep a custody record on every person in custody. The Garda in
charge of the Garda Station is responsible for the accuracy of all entries in

If you are transferred to another Garda Station, the Garda in charge of the
station must send the custody record with you.
