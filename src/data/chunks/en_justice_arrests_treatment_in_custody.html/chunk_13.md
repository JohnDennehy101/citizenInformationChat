###  Ill-treatment

No Garda can subject you to ill-treatment of any kind or the threat of ill-
treatment (whether against you, your family or any other person connected with
you) or permit any other person to do so.

No Garda can use force against you unless reasonable force is necessary:

  * In self-defence 
  * To make sure that you comply with lawful directions 
  * To prevent your escape 
  * To restrain you from injuring yourself or others, damaging property or destroying or interfering with evidence 

If you allege physical ill-treatment, the Garda in charge of the station will
arrange for you to be medically examined. However, if you have made the
allegation about a Garda, the member in charge of the station may not order
the medical examination if they consider the complaint to be frivolous or
vexatious.
