##  Introduction

After you are [ arrested ](/en/justice/arrests/arrests/) , you may be taken
into custody in a Garda Station.

When you are in custody, you must be treated with due respect for your
personal rights and dignity at all times, and the Gardaí must have regard to
any physical or mental disability you may have. There should be no unnecessary
delay in dealing with you.

The rules and procedures about how you must be treated while you are in
custody are set out in the [ Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Treatment of Persons
in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) Regulations 1987
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1987/en/si/0119.html) and 2006.
