##  Garda duties to give you information

After you have been arrested, the Garda in charge of the station must give you
information about:

  * Why you have been arrested 
  * Your right to consult a solicitor 
  * Your right to tell another person that you are in custody 

If you are under 18 years of age, the Garda must tell you that your parents
will be informed that you are in custody and asked to come to the Garda
station.

Informing others about you

Information about where you are in custody must be given with your consent to:

  * Any solicitor who enquires and 
  * Any other person if the Garda in charge of the station is satisfied that the information will not delay the investigation of a crime or make the investigation more difficult 

If you are arrested in a Garda District other than the one you live in, the
District Headquarters in the district you live in must also be notified.
