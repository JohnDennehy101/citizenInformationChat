###  Getting other State support for the same employee

If you are an employer getting JobsPlus, you cannot get financial aid from
other State sources for the costs of the same employee.

When applying for JobsPlus, you must tell DSP if you are getting any other
State funding towards the employment costs of an employee.

If approved for JobsPlus, you must also tell any State bodies from which you
are getting funding (for example, Enterprise Ireland and the Community
Services Programme).

Similarly, you cannot get JobsPlus for any employment positions included under
other State-funded wage supports. This is to prevent double funding.
