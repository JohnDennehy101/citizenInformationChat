##  Payment rates

Employers can get 2 levels of payment depending on an employee’s
circumstances. The levels are €7,500 or €10,000 and they depend on the age of
the employee and the length of time they are getting a qualifying payment.

The rates are paid to the employer over 2 years (24 monthly payments) for each
eligible person they recruit and keep in the job.

There is no limit to the number of employees you can hire through JobsPlus.

Payment is made monthly in arrears by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT). It is
not taxable for income or corporation tax purposes.
