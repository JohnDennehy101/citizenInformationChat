###  When you have shortlisted your candidates

Once you have carried out preliminary interviews and shortlisted the
candidates, you should ask these candidates to [ apply to JobsPlus to confirm
their eligibility for the incentive
](https://jobsplus.welfare.ie/Employee/Create) .

The DSP will process their request and, if they are eligible, post a 2-part
JP1 form to the candidate. Part A of the JP1 form will confirm the employee’s
eligibility and rate of payment for the prospective employer. The candidate
should bring the 2-part JP1 form confirming their eligibility to you for
consideration.

If you choose to employ the candidate, you should complete Part B of the JP1
form, sign the declaration and return it to the DSP.

The JP1 form will be processed by the Department, and once all conditions are
met, you will be told by email that you have been awarded the incentive for
the employee specified on the JP1 form.

Once the candidate has been employed, they should contact the DSP to close
their jobseeker’s claim. This can be done in 2 ways:

  1. [ Online using mywelfare.ie ](https://services.mywelfare.ie/)
  2. By contacting their [ local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) . 

Your payment of JobsPlus only starts when the DSP confirms the employee’s
jobseeker claim is closed. The DSP will not backdate the incentive.
