##  Making a complaint

You can make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission about a breach
of your rights as an agency worker, using the [ online complaint form
](https://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/e-complaint_form/) .

You must make the complaint **within 6 months** of the dispute. The time limit
can be extended for a further 6 months, if there is a _reasonable cause_ which
prevented you from bringing the complaint within the normal time limit.
