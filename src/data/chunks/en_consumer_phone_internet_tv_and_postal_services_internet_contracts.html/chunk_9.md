###  Bundles

Broadband is often offered as part of a package or bundle with TV or [ home
phone ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer/phone-internet-tv-and-
postal-services/phone-contracts/) . These types of packages can be good value
but only if you plan to use them. Make sure you are happy with what is being
offered for each part of the bundle (for example the data speed, the amount of
TV channels and the calls included for home phone) before you sign the
contract.

ComReg has an independent price guide to help you [ compare the cost of
broadband packages ](https://www.comreg.ie/compare/#/services) .
