##  Billing options

You can get your bills by email or through the provider’s website. If you
can’t get bills in an electronic format because of limited access to the
internet or other issues, the provider must give you a paper bill for free.
You must be told when the bill is available online (for example, by text
message).

You may receive a single bill for a bundle (home phone, broadband and TV) but
if you make calls, texts or data outside your allocated allowance, you will be
charged at a much higher rate.

When you switch to a new provider, your first bill may be higher than
expected. This is because you are paying from the date your service was
connected as well as the price plan for the month ahead.
