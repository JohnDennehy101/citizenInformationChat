###  **Incorrect billing**

If you get a bill that you think is incorrect you should raise this
immediately with your service provider as a complaint.

You should give your provider 10 working days to investigate and resolve the
billing issue. If they haven’t resolved the issue or you’re not happy with the
response, you can contact ComReg who can escalate your complaint with your
service provider on your behalf.

See more information below on making a complaint.
