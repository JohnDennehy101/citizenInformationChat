##  Switching providers

When comparing internet service providers and plans, think about:

  * Price of the contract and what’s included in the price (for example, TV and landline) 
  * Charges and fees (are there connection charges, monthly rental fees, call costs, disconnection or reconnection charges?) 
  * What speed you need 
  * What data limits apply and are they enough? 
  * Minimum contract period 
  * Penalties for ending the contract early 
  * Network coverage in your area 

Before you switch, contact your current provider to check if any cancellation
period or penalties apply.

If your broadband service needs a telephone line to access the internet, you
will probably need your Universal Account Number (UAN) to switch. This is
usually on your bill, but if you can’t find it, you can ask your existing
provider.
