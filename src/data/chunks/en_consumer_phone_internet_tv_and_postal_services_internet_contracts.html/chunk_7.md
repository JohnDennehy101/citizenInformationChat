###  'Up to' and 'unlimited'

Many ISPs say ‘up to’ a certain Mbps or Mb of download or upload speed when
advertising plans. This is because the speed that you can get in your home
will depend on:

  * The type of connection you have 
  * The modem or router you use 
  * Where you live 
  * How your mobile, tablet, or PC are connected, it could be directly to the modem or through WiFi. 

Many broadband plans offer ‘unlimited’ data. This is often subject to a ‘fair
usage’ policy. Service providers must make sure that usage limits or ‘fair
usage’ policies are explained in the terms and conditions in a clear and
understandable way.
