##  Making an agreement when renting your room

Before you rent out a room in your home, you and the person renting the room
should agree some ground rules and put them in writing. If you both sign and
keep a copy of this agreement, you can refer to it if there is a disagreement.
These ground rules might include:

  * How long is the licence arrangement going to last? 
  * How much notice you must give if either of you chooses to end the arrangement? 
  * How much rent will be paid and how often? 
  * How will rent be paid? Will it be in cash, or by cheque or standing order? 
  * When will the rent be reviewed and how much notice will you give of a rent review? 
  * How are utility bills divided between you? 
  * Can the person who is renting have visitors to stay overnight? 
  * Are there any restrictions about noise levels?
