###  Setting the rent and having a licence agreement

You can decide how much rent to charge. If your income from rent is less than
€14,000 a year, you can claim rent-a-room relief. This means this income is
tax-free.

However, this rental income will be considered when calculating the
differential rent you pay the local authority. So, if your application is
approved, the local authority will review your rent to take this additional
income into account.

You and the student will have a licence agreement rather than a tenancy
agreement. You must put this arrangement in writing, see ‘ [ Making an
agreement when renting your room
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-
owners/renting-out-a-room-in-your-home/#1b1817) '. This written agreement can
be referred to if there is a dispute.

The tenancy agreement you have with your local authority might need to be
updated, so you can participate in the scheme.
