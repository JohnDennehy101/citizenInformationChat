##  Repossession of properties rented by approved housing bodies

[ Approved housing bodies (AHBs) ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) must follow residential tenancies
legislation when ending a tenancy.

If a tenant breaches their tenancy agreement with an AHB, the AHB will send
the tenant a tenancy warning letter. Examples of breaches of a tenancy
agreement include anti-social behaviour and not paying the rent. The tenancy
warning outlines the issue and explains how the tenant can fix it.

If the tenant does not fix the issue or does not get in touch with the AHB
about how they can resolve things, the AHB can issue a notice of termination
to end the tenancy. The AHB must follow [ the rules for residential tenancies
when issuing a notice of termination
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/tenants-rights-
and-responsibilities/if-your-landlord-wants-you-to-leave/#8cf07e) .

If an AHB tenant wants to dispute the notice of termination, they can access
the [ Residential Tenancies Boardâ€™s dispute resolution service
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-
disputes/disputes-between-landlords-and-tenants/#e337f0) .

Some people living in AHB accommodation have a licence arrangement with the
AHB instead of a tenancy agreement. For example, people living in temporary
hostels or supported accommodation. These [ licence arrangements
](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-compliance/beginning-a-tenancy/types-of-
tenancies-and-agreements#news_content5) are not tenancies, so they are not
covered by residential tenancies legislation and, these procedures do not
apply to them.
