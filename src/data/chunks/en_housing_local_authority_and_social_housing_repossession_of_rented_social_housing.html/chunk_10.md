###  Repossession where people living in the property are not tenants

If someone who is not entitled to a tenancy is occupying a property, the local
authority can apply to the District Court for a possession order. The local
authority must make sure that it protects the identity of the person who
informed them about this, if this is necessary.

If the tenant has died and the occupier is (or claims to be) a member of the
late tenant’s household, but is not entitled to succeed to the tenancy, the
local authority can apply for a possession order. If the occupier has applied
for a succession tenancy and been refused, the possession application must
give the basis for that refusal and refer to the local authority’s written
policy on succession tenancies.

At least 10 working days before the District Court hearing, the local
authority must give the occupant written notice of the hearing and details of
the possession application.

The court can make a possession order if it appears that:

  * The local authority has grounds for the recovery of possession 
  * Repossession is a proportionate response to the occupier’s occupation of the property 
  * Making the order is reasonable in all the circumstances
