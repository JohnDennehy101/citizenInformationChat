##  What is a tenancy warning?

The local authority should send you a tenancy warning if there is an alleged
breach of your tenancy conditions. For example, if you don’t pay your rent or
there is anti-social behaviour.

The tenancy warning is a written warning to the tenant that explains the
issue, describes how the tenant can fix it and explains what will happen if
they don’t.

If there is a very serious breach of the tenancy conditions, the local
authority may not have to issue a tenancy warning. However, if the local
authority applies to repossess the property without first issuing a tenancy
warning, the application for a possession order must state the reasons why a
tenancy warning was not issued.

These repossession procedures and the requirements for tenancy warnings are
set out in the [ Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/act/21/enacted/en/index.html) and
the [ Housing (Local Authority Tenancy Warnings) Regulations 2015
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2015/si/122/made/en/print) .
