##  What happens when you get a tenancy warning?

You can ask for an internal review of a tenancy warning. This should be made
within 10 working days of the warning being issued, or within 20 working days
in exceptional circumstances.

Your request for a review should:

  * Outline why you are requesting the review 
  * Include any supporting documents 
  * State if you or a household member wants to make oral representation as part of the review 

If you do not ask for a review, the warning takes effect from the second
working day after the period for requesting a review has expired. If you asked
for a review, and the warning has been upheld or changed, it comes into effect
on the second working day after the decision was sent to the tenant.
