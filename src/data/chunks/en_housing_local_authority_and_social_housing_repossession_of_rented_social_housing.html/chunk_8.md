##  What happens if the local authority applies for repossession?

If you do not deal with the breach of the tenancy agreement, even after the
tenancy warning, the local authority can apply to the District Court for a
possession order to repossess the property. The court may order:

  * That the tenancy ends 
  * A member of the household is excluded from the tenancy, in the case of anti-social behaviour 

The local authority must give you at least 10 days’ notice of the court
hearing. But, if the breach of the tenancy agreement is having serious effects
on people living nearby, it must give you a copy of the possession application
as soon as it applies for the order. This must include a written explanation
of why you were not given the 10 days’ notice.

The possession application must give:

  * The reasons for the application, including full details of the breach of the tenancy agreement 
  * The name of person causing it 
  * Its effects on people living nearby 

The application must also give details of any tenancy warnings you or a
household member have received in the last 5 years. If you didn’t get a
tenancy warning for the current breach, the application must give reasons why
none was issued. If there is a tenancy warning for a similar breach currently
under review, the application must give the reasons why the possession order
is being looked for at the same time.

If a possession order is granted, it gives the date when the local authority
can repossess the property. This must be no sooner than 2 months (and no later
than 9 months) after the date of the order. The tenancy will be terminated on
the date that the local authority takes possession of the property under the
possession order.
