##  Collaborative practice

Collaborative practice is a way of resolving family law matters, including
separation and divorce. Both you and your spouse/partner work with
collaborative lawyers. Everyone signs an agreement disqualifying your
collaborative lawyers from representing you in court if the process breaks
down. Neither lawyer can act for you in any contested court proceedings.

Through face-to-face meetings, you and your spouse/civil partner discuss and
resolve issues such as custody and access to children, maintenance and
property rights. The process is dependent on both parties making full and
frank disclosure of all of their assets so that negotiations can be open and
honest.

If the process is successful you will have an agreement with your spouse/civil
partner which you will both have had responsibility for.

Not every lawyer is trained in collaborative law and it is likely to be more
difficult to engage in the process if one of the lawyers is not so trained.
