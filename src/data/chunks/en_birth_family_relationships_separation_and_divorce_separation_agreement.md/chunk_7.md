The [ Family Mediation Service ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-
and-divorce/family-mediation-separating-couples/) is part of the Legal Aid
Board and is free of charge. Alternatively you may choose to pay a private
mediator. Private mediators charge in a variety of ways (daily rate/hourly
rate/flat rate). The [ Mediators' Institute of Ireland
](https://www.themii.ie/) can provide you with a list of private accredited
mediators.

If you are eligible for legal aid and advice from the Legal Aid Board, you
must pay a contribution towards costs. The Legal Aid Board can provide you
with a lawyer trained in collaborative practice. Private collaborative
practitioners charge an hourly rate which you can agree in advance.

If you choose to use a private solicitor, you should be aware that there is no
fixed rate of charges for legal fees. You are advised to obtain some quotes
before deciding on a legal firm.
