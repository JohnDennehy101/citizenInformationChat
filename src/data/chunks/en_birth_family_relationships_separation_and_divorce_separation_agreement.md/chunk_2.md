##  Introduction

If a married couple or civil partners can agree the terms on which they will
live separately, they may enter into a _separation agreement_ . The essence of
a separation agreement is that it is an agreement. Both parties must consent
to the terms of the agreement.

The agreement is a legally binding contract setting out each party's rights
and obligations to the other. The terms of the agreement are usually reached
either through mediation or negotiation through solicitors. If agreement can
be reached reasonably quickly between the parties and a separation agreement
drawn up, it is cheaper and less stressful than taking a court case. Many
couples formalise their separation in this way.
