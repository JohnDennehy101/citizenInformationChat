##  Deed of Separation

The actual document drawn up and signed by both parties, when they reach
agreement, is often called a _Deed of Separation_ and is a legally binding
written contract. The main issues dealt with in a separation agreement are as
follows:

  * An agreement to live apart 
  * Agreed arrangements in relation to [ custody and access to children ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/separation-and-divorce-children/)
  * The occupation and ownership of the [ family/shared home ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/family-and-shared-home/) and any other property 
  * [ Maintenance and any lump sum payments ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/)
  * Indemnity from the debts of the other spouse/civil partner 
  * Taxation 
  * [ Succession rights ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/succession/) . 

It can be made into a rule of court by application to the court. This ensures
that all the terms agreed upon can be legally enforced where covered by
appropriate legislation. Information on [ making a separation agreement a rule
of court ](https://www.courts.ie/judicial-separation) is available on the
Courts Service website.

**Reversing a separation**

If you and your former partner decide to get back together, you can apply to
the court to have your deed of separation cancelled. You will have to satisfy
the court that you have reconciled as a couple and that you intend to resume
cohabiting as a married couple.
