###  Lead pipes outside your property’s boundary

If your drinking water comes through lead pipes that are outside the
boundaries of your property, they must also be replaced. If you are a customer
of Irish Water and you plan to replace the lead pipes within your property’s
boundary, you must first apply for Uisce Éireann's [ Customer Opt-In Lead Pipe
Replacement Scheme ](https://www.water.ie/projects-plans/our-plans/lead-
mitigation-plan/faqs/Updated-Step-by-step-guide-to-Customer-Opt-in-Lead-Pipe-
Replacement-Scheme.pdf) (pdf). Under this scheme, Uisce Éireann will replace
any lead pipes on the public side of your property’s boundary.
