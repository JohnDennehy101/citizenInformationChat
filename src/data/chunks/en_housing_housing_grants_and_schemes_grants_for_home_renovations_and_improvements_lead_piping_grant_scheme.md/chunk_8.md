###  Documents from your building contractor

Any contractor that you use must provide you with either a:

  * Tax Clearance Access Number and Tax Reference Number 
  * Revenue Online Service (ROS) printout of an eTax Clearance certificate 

They must give you itemised receipts, detailing the work carried out and the
associated costs. They must also provide certification that any materials
used, including pipes and fittings, are of appropriate quality and that a
proper standard of workmanship has been applied.
