###  Evidence that your lead pipes need to be replaced

You must have evidence that the lead pipes in your home need to be replaced.
This can be:

  * A notification from your water supplier (Uisce Ã‰ireann or a group water scheme) advising that your water system probably contains lead pipes and fittings 
  * A laboratory certificate issued within the previous 6 months, showing that the level of lead in your water supply is over the legal limit. The issuing laboratory must be accredited by the [ Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB) ](http://www.inab.ie/) for testing for lead in drinking water. 
  * A notification from a registered building professional advising that your water system has lead pipes. Registered building professionals include registered architects, chartered engineers, and registered building surveyors.
