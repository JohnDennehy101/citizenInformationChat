###  Annuities

With an annuity, you use all or part of your retirement fund to buy a regular
pension income. In return for transferring your retirement fund to a life
assurance company, the company will pay you a secure regular income for the
rest of your life. The amount of this income depends on:

  * The amount of your retirement fund 
  * Your age and health 
  * Whether you are male or female 
  * Whether your pension will continue to be paid to any dependants after your death 
  * The annuity rate that the life assurance company offers
