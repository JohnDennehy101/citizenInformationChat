###  Inheritance by your child

If the ARF funds are inherited by your child, the taxation treatment depends
on their age at the time of your death. If they are:

  * Under 21, no income tax is payable. CAT may be payable depending on the total amount inherited. 
  * 21 or over, income tax at rate of 30% is chargeable. However, CAT is not payable.
