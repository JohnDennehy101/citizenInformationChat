##  What is collective bargaining?

Collective bargaining is where an employer and a trade union voluntarily
decide to talk and agree on working conditions or terms of employment (or non-
employment) of workers.

There is no legal obligation on an employer to recognise or deal with a trade
union to negotiate pay and work conditions. In practice, many terms and
conditions of employment are negotiated and agreed upon through collective
bargaining.
