###  Health checks

Public health nurses are notified of all births in their area - either by the
hospital where the baby was born or by the midwife who was present for a home
birth.

After the birth, your [ public health nurse will visit you ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/maternity-care-and-public-health-
nurse#ld39d3) and your child at home free of charge, usually within 72 hours
of returning home from hospital. They will carry out an examination of your
newborn baby and a check-up for you.

The public health nurse will arrange with you to [ check your baby's
development at different stages ](/en/birth-family-relationships/after-your-
baby-is-born/maternity-care-and-public-health-nurse#ld39d3) . For example, at
9 months, they will check all aspects of the child's development, including [
hearing ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/your-childs-
developmental-checks/9-to-11-months-check.html#Hearing) , [ eyesight
](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/your-childs-developmental-
checks/9-to-11-months-check.html#Eyesight) , [ speech development
](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/your-childs-developmental-
checks/9-to-11-months-check.html#Speech-development) and [ physical
development ](https://www2.hse.ie/wellbeing/child-health/your-childs-
developmental-checks/9-to-11-months-check.html#Physical-development) .

Problems that are found at developmental checks may be treated free of charge
at out-patient hospital departments and any treatment needed after is free as
a public patient.

Your child will also get [ vaccines ](/en/health/health-services/children-s-
health/vaccinations-for-children/) to keep them safe from disease. These are
also free.
