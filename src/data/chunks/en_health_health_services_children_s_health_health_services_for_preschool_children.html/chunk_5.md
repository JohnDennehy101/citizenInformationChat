##  How to apply

You do not need to apply for your child’s health checks. You will be contacted
by your public health nurse before each check to arrange a date and time. If
you have not heard from the public health nurse, [ call your local health
centre ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) to make an
appointment.

Talk to your GP or [ public health nurse
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/healthcentres/) if you are concerned
about your child’s development. They may carry out further screening or refer
your child to a specialist.
