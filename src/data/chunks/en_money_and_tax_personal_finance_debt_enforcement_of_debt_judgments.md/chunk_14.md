###  If you do not attend a hearing

If you do not turn up, without a reasonable excuse, the judge can either
adjourn the hearing or issue an arrest warrant. An arrest warrant orders the
Gardaí to bring you before the court as soon as possible.

If you are later arrested and brought to court, a date is fixed for the
hearing. The judge must make clear to you, in ordinary language:

  * That you are entitled to apply for legal aid, and 
  * The consequences if you do not comply with the instalment order or do not appear for the hearing on the date fixed – including going to prison 

The court has the power to grant you legal aid in line with the rules
governing the [ criminal legal aid scheme ](/en/justice/legal-aid-and-
advice/criminal-legal-aid/) .
