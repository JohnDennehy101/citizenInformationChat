####  Powers of a Sheriff or County Registrar to seize goods

The Sheriff or County Registrar does not have to give you notice of their
intention to seize your property or goods. Their duty is to the creditor, so
they cannot take your circumstances into account.

The Sheriff or County Registrar has the power to go onto your property to take
your goods. They must make reasonable efforts to do this peacefully. They are
entitled to forcibly enter your property.

The Sheriff or County Registrar must account to the court for the goods
seized. If no goods are found, they make a return of **nulla bona** ,
literally meaning **"no goods"** .

If the Sheriff or County Registrar does take your goods, they must give you an
itemised and signed list of the goods seized. They must give you this list
within 24 hours. They can then sell the goods by public auction. This can
happen at any time from 2 days after the seizure. In practice, you are usually
given warning of the sale.
