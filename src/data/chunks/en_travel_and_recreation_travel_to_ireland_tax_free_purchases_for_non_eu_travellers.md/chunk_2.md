##  Introduction

Visitors to Ireland from outside the European Union (EU) can buy goods in
Ireland to take home with them and benefit from tax relief. This is called the
Retail Export Scheme. It includes visitors from Great Britain but does not
include people resident in Northern Ireland.

Tax relief is not allowed on services, for example, hotel accommodation,
meals, or car hire. The visitor must provide proof that they are a visitor
from outside the EU when making each purchase. The proof includes evidence of
the place of residence, inbound and outbound flight dates, and a signed
declaration.
