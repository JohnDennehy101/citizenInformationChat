##  Using a VAT-refunding agency

Many retailers operate the refund scheme using VAT-refunding agencies that
arrange for the tourist or visitor to benefit from the tax concession. VAT-
refunding agencies operate independently of the tax authorities:

Agencies use their own systems for operating the scheme, for example:

  * The goods are sold tax-free at the point of sale: You fill out the agency’s tax-free form, have it signed in the shop, attach your purchase receipt to it, and return it to the agency. Your credit card will be charged the value of the tax if the documentation is not handed in at the airport or subsequently returned to the agency. 
  * Tax is paid at the point of sale: You follow the same procedure as above and the tax is refunded to you at the airport when you are leaving. 
  * Tax is paid at the point of sale: You follow the same procedure as above and the tax is refunded by the agency to you, either by post or by credit card transfer. 

Some agencies use a card to record your purchases rather than forms. You swipe
the card each time you make a purchase. You can get more information from the
agency.

Individual tax-free forms for purchases of up to €2,000 (including VAT) may be
lodged directly with the agency refund booths at the airport without a Customs
stamp. Documentation for individual purchases of over €2,000 (including VAT)
must always be presented by you to Customs, with the related export voucher,
so that the voucher can be certified. This is necessary before a VAT refund
can be processed.

You should keep your copy of the documentation received from the retailer for
future reference. If you are mailing the documentation back for a refund, it
is advisable to keep a photocopy.
