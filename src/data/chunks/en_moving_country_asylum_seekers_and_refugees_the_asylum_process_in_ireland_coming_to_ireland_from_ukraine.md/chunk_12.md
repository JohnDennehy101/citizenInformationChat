####  Before 14 March 2024

If you registered for temporary protection and State-provided accommodation
before 14 March 2024, you could get [ social welfare payments
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-
system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/applying-for-a-social-welfare-
payment/) in the same way as Irish citizens, as long as you met the
eligibility conditions.

If you stay in accommodation where food is provided, you must pay a
contribution of €10 per day for adults, and €5 per day for each child. You do
not have to pay for your first 2 weeks. If you refuse to pay, you could be
asked to leave.

A short-term absence from your accommodation may be allowed in exceptional
circumstances only. Absence requests must be applied for in advance and are
decided on a case-by-case basis. You can read more about [ the absence from
accommodation protocol

recognition-payment/) .
