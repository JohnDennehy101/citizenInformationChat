####  Car insurance

By law you must be insured to drive your Ukrainian car when using it on Irish
roads. The Motor (Transport) Insurance Bureau of Ukraine (UA) has prepared a
list of Ukrainian Insurance Providers that allows Ukrainian refugees to renew
their insurance policies online and to get an International Insurance Green
Card. You can find more information about this at [ www.mibi.ie
