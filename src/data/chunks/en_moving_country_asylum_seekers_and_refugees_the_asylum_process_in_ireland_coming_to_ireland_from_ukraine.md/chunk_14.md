###  How to apply for accommodation

If you have nowhere to stay, you should tell immigration officials when you
arrive in Ireland. They will refer you to the Governmentâ€™s Ukraine Crisis
Temporary Accommodation Team (UCTAT).

If you need accommodation and you are already in Ireland, you can email [
ukrainetempaccom@equality.gov.ie ](mailto:ukrainetempaccom@equality.gov.ie) .
You may have to wait until accommodation is available.

Include the following information in your email:

  * The full name of anyone who needs accommodation 
  * Dates of birth 
  * Phone number 
  * Where you are now (the full address if you have one) 
  * When you need the accommodation (for example, from tonight) 
  * Medical conditions, disabilities, allergies and dietary requirements
