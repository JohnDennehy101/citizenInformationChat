##  Healthcare and medical cards

Health services in Ireland are delivered by Ireland’s public healthcare
service - the [ Health Service Executive (HSE) ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/) .
You can get the same [ public healthcare services as people who live in
Ireland ](/en/health/health-system/entitlement-to-public-health-services/) .

Everyone coming to Ireland under the Temporary Protection Directive can apply
for a medical card with a simplified application process. A medical card
allows you to visit a doctor for free, access other health services and get
medicines at a reduced price. Children aged 16 and over must apply for a
medical card separately.

When you first arrive in Ireland, you should apply for your medical card using
a special [ medical card application form (pdf)

mc1-u-form-ukrainian.pdf) for people from Ukraine. Read [ information from the
HSE in Ukrainian and Russian ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/healthcare-in-
ireland/english/ukrainian-nationals.html) . You can email your completed form
to [ PCRS.Applications@HSE.ie ](mailto:PCRS.Applications@HSE.ie) or by post to
the address on the form.
