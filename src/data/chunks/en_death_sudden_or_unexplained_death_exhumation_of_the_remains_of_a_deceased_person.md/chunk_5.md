###  A local authority may refuse an exhumation licence because:

  * The consent of the next of kin has not been given 
  * The burial plot cannot be identified 
  * The remains lie unidentified in a common plot (for example the burial plot of a religious order) 
  * Due respect to the person who died cannot be guaranteed 
  * The remains to be exhumed are located below a body that is not to be exhumed 
  * Public health and decency cannot be protected 
  * Ground conditions in the graveyard would make an exhumation difficult or unsafe 
  * Conditions attached to the exhumation licence cannot be complied with.
