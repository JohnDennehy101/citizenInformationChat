##  Arrangements for exhumation

After your local authority has granted an exhumation licence, the exhumation
must take place within 12 months.

There must be an Environmental Health Officer (EHO) present at the exhumation.
This is to ensure that all procedures are complied with and everyone present
shows respect to the deceased person at all times. The EHO must be notified of
the time, date and place of exhumation at least five working days before the
exhumation.

Screens are placed around the existing grave to protect the exhumation from
public view. If necessary, an area of the graveyard is cordoned off to ensure
privacy. Workers must treat the neighbouring burial plots with care.
Disinfectants and disposable protective clothing must be available to workers
and disposed of safely after the exhumation.

The exhumed remains (including the existing casket) are placed in a new casket
(the ‘shell’). Any other remains in the same burial plot that may have been
disturbed during the exhumation are reburied with respect.
