###  The Household Charge and Non-Principal Private Residence Charge

The Local Property Tax replaced the [ Household Charge
](https://www.householdcharge.ie) which was abolished from 1 January 2013. [
Household Charge arrears ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/online-
services/services/property/payment-household-charge-arrears.aspx) that were
not paid by 1 July 2013 were converted into LPT and are now collected by
Revenue through the LPT system.

The [ Non-Principal Private Residence (NPPR) charge ](https://www.nppr.ie/) on
second homes was introduced in 2009 and paid to the relevant local authority.
From 2014 onwards, the NPPR is no longer charged, but outstanding liabilities
and payments will still be collected. If you are selling your house and need
to prove that you have paid the NPPR, you can request a certificate of
discharge from the [ Local Authority ](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-
information/fd139-local-government-councils-and-
councillors/?referrer=http://www.housing.gov.ie/local-
government/administration/local-authorities/local-authorities) .

After 12 years the charges expire and so are no longer due to be paid. If
there was an NPPR charge on a property for 2009, it expired on 1 August 2021.
Charges for the years 2010â€“2013 expire on 1 April. An NPPR charge for 2010,
for example, expired on 1 April 2022 and the charge for 2013 will expire on 1
April 2025. For more information, see [ nppr.ie ](https://www.nppr.ie/) .
