##  Who must pay Local Property Tax?

If you own residential property on 1 November, including rental property, you
must pay LPT. This date is called the _liability date_ .

If there is more than one owner, you need to agree on who will pay the tax,
otherwise, Revenue can collect it from any of the owners.

In some cases, you must pay the LPT if you are not the owner:

  * If you are a tenant with a long-term lease of more than 20 years or 
  * If you have a right to live in the property for life or for more than 20 years or a right to live there ‘to the exclusion of all others’ 

If a property is rented on a normal short-term lease (less than 20 years), the
landlord pays the LPT.
