##  Do I have to submit a Local Property Tax return?

**If you submitted an LPT return for 2023** for your property, you **do not**
need to make another return for 2024. You may need to arrange to [ pay the LPT
](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/paying-local-property-tax/)
for 2024.

For the years 2022 to 2025, the LPT is based on the value of your property on
**1 November 2021** . This is called the valuation date.

**You do need to submit an LPT return for 2024 if you have a property that has
become liable** since the valuation date and you have not submitted a return
for it. For example, you may have a property that has been built or become
residential after 1 November 2022 and so is a liable property on 1 November
2023. If you have a property that is newly built or renovated, you should [
assess the value it would have had on 1 November 2021
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/valuing-your-
property/newly-liable-properties.aspx) if it had been completed then.

You must [ assess the market value of your property ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/valuing-property-for-lpt/) and **submit your
LPT return by 1 December 2023** .

You are required to submit your LPT return even if:

  * Your property is eligible for [ an LPT exemption ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/lpt-exemptions/index.aspx) or 
  * You are claiming a [ deferral of LPT payment ](https://revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/deferral-of-payment/index.aspx)
