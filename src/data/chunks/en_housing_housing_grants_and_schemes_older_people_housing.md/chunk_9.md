###  Getting supports so you can stay in your home

If you are finding it difficult to live at home because you can’t complete
everyday tasks, you may be able to get help with this. You may qualify for the
HSE’s [ Home Support Service ](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-
older-people/home-support-service/) , which provides carers who will come to
your home and help with everyday tasks, such as getting in and out of bed,
bathing and dressing. This service is free and is available to people aged 65
or over who may need support to continue living at home or to return home
following a hospital stay. If you do not qualify for the scheme you may be
able to get a carer privately.
