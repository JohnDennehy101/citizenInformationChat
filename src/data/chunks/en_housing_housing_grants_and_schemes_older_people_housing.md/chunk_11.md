####  Moving into someone else's home

If your home becomes unsuitable you may consider moving in with a family
member or friend.

The HSE also provides a [ Boarding Out Scheme ](/en/health/health-
services/health-services-for-older-people/boarding-out-of-older-people/) .
This scheme arranges accommodation for people who are dependant in private
houses. If you take part in this scheme, the householder is responsible for
giving you suitable care as well as nutritious and varied food.

The [ HSE ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/health-system/health-
service-executive/) is responsible for making arrangements for boarding out
and will cover either all or part of the cost. The Boarding Out Scheme is not
available in all areas.
