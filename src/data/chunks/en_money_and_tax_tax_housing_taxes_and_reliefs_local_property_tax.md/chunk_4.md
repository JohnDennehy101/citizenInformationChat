##  How much is the Local Property Tax?

The tax you pay is based on the market value of the property on the valuation
date. The valuation date for LPT is **1 November 2021** . The value of your
property on that date will be used to calculate your LPT for the years 2022 to
2025.

The LPT is a self-assessment tax, so you calculate the tax due based on your
own assessment of the market value of the property. Read about [ how to value
your property for Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-
and-reliefs/valuing-property-for-lpt/) .

There are different rates of LPT depending on which range, or valuation band,
your property value is in.
