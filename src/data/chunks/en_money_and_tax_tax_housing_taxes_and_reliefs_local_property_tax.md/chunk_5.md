###  The local adjustment factor

Local authorities can vary the basic LPT rate on residential properties in
their area. These rates can be increased or decreased by up to 15%. This is
known as the local adjustment factor.

Residential properties of the same value in different local authority areas
may pay different amounts of LPT, depending on whether the local authority has
applied a local adjustment factor or not.

There is [ a list of local authority LPT adjustments
](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/valuing-your-
property/determining-lpt-charge.aspx) on revenue.ie. Revenue also has an [
online LPT calculator ](https://lpt.revenue.ie/lpt-web/reckoner/lpt.html) that
calculates the tax after the local adjustment factor.
