##  Introduction

An annual Local Property Tax (LPT) is charged on residential properties in
Ireland.

You are liable for LPT in 2024 if you own a residential property on 1 November
2023.

**If you paid LPT for 2023**

If you paid LPT for 2023 with a repeating payment method, such as a direct
debit, the payment will continue in 2024 unless you choose a different way to
pay. Repeating methods include LPT deductions from your salary, pension or
social protection payment. If you have changed bank, you may need to [ update
your direct debit ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-
tax/paying-your-lpt/changing-bank-details.aspx) .

If you paid LPT for 2023 with a type of payment that does not automatically
repeat, you need to choose how you want to pay LPT for 2024. You can do this
in your [ Revenue property record ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-
property-tax/lpt-liability/your-revenue-property-record.aspx) .

You should have confirmed your payment method with Revenue by:

  * 1 December 2023, if you choose to spread the payments over the year 
  * 10 January 2024, if you choose to pay in a single payment 

**If you did not pay 2023 LPT**

If your property was not liable for LPT on 1 November 2022 but is liable on 1
November 2023, you should [ submit an LPT return
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-
reliefs/local-property-tax/#5a2b43) by 1 December 2023. Even if you own a [
property that is exempt ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-
reliefs/local-property-tax-exemptions/) , you must still make a Local Property
Tax return to claim an exemption.

If you were liable for 2023 LPT but did not submit an LPT return you should do
so now.

You may be able to [ defer payment of the LPT ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-
taxes-and-reliefs/deferring-local-property-tax/) in certain circumstances.
