###  Who is considered an employee?

Employers hire people on two different types of contract:

  * **Contracts of service** : the person is an employee and is protected by employment legislation. 
  * **Contracts for service** : the person is an independent or self-employed contractor. They are not considered employees and may not be protected by all employment legislation. 

The difference between these types of contract can sometimes be unclear.
However, the type of contract can have serious implications for the employer
and employee for employment protection legislation, taxation and social
welfare.
