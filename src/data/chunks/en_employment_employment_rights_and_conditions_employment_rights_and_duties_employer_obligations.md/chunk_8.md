###  Leave

Nearly all employees are entitled to [ annual leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/annual-
leave/) and [ public holidays ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/public-holidays/) , from the time they start
work. Most employees are entitled to 4 weeks’ paid annual leave for each leave
year. Part-time workers’ are generally entitled to 8% of the hours they have
worked, up to a maximum of 4 working weeks for each leave year.
