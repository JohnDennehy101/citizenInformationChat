###  Reporting accidents

You must report any accident that results in an employee missing 3 consecutive
days at work (not including the day of the accident) to the Health and Safety
Authority.

Non-fatal accidents or dangerous occurrences should be reported on within 10
working days of the event.

The HSA has a [ guide on reporting accidents and dangerous occurrences (pdf)
