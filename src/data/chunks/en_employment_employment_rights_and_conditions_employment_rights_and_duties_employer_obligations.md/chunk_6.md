###  Rates of pay

Most workers are entitled to [ minimum wage (â‚¬12.70 per hour)
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-
wage/) . However, there are some exceptions to this, such as apprentices,
people aged under 20 and people employed by close relatives.

You must give your employees [ payslips ](/en/employment/employment-rights-
and-conditions/pay-and-employment/pay-slip/) . These show their wages and any
deductions that have been made.
