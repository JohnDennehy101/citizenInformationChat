###  Non-resident accounts

If you are not [ resident in Ireland for tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/moving-
country-and-taxation/tax-residence-and-domicile-in-ireland/) , you may get a
refund of DIRT that has been deducted from your Irish deposit interest. To get
a refund of DIRT, Ireland must have a double taxation agreement with the
country you are resident in. DIRT will be refunded under the terms of that
agreement. Fill in [ IC5 form (pdf) ](http://www.revenue.ie/ga/additional-
incomes/documents/form-ic5.pdf) to apply for a refund of DIRT.

If you are not resident, and do not pay tax, in Ireland, you may get your
Irish deposit interest paid without the deduction of DIRT. You do not have to
be a resident of a country that has a double taxation agreement with Ireland
to apply for a DIRT exemption. You should contact your financial institution
to find out if you can be exempt from paying DIRT. You will have to complete a
Non-Residence Declaration.
