##  Rules

DIRT is deducted before the interest is paid to you. You are entitled to get a
statement of the DIRT deducted if you ask for it.

If you have paid DIRT, you do not have to pay any further income tax or
Universal Social Charge on the interest, but you must declare the interest as
income if you are making an income tax return.

In some circumstances, you may have to pay [ PRSI on deposit interest

  * Charities 
  * People not resident for tax in Ireland (see also 'non-resident accountsâ€™ below)
