###  Consultation solicitor service

You may also need to consult a solicitor if your case raises legal issues. For
example, your mortgage lender may have written to you, seeking repossession of
your home or proposing that you surrender it.

Your financial adviser under the scheme (PIP, MABS adviser or accountant) may
recommend that you get this legal advice.

Your financial adviser can apply to MABS for a legal advice voucher on your
behalf. You can then choose a solicitor from the Abhaile panel of solicitors.

The legal advice voucher will get you a face-to-face consultation with a
solicitor. The consultation solicitor will:

  * Assess and explain your legal position 
  * Advise you on any repossession proceedings and any legal issues relating to your mortgage arrears 
  * Confirm their legal advice to you in writing 

If the lender has already issued repossession proceedings, the consultation
solicitor may be able to negotiate on your behalf to settle the proceedings
out of court.

It is important to note that the solicitor will need to see any documents that
are relevant in your case, particularly your up-to-date financial statement
and any written financial advice that you have received under the Scheme.
