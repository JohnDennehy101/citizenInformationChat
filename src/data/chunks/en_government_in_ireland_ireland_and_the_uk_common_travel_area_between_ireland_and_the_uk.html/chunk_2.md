##  What is the Common Travel Area?

The Common Travel Area (CTA) is an arrangement between the United Kingdom (UK)
and Ireland that gives a variety of rights to citizens of those countries. It
includes more than the basic right to travel freely between both countries.

When the Common Travel Area arrangement began in 1922, it was not contained in
any legislation. It was an understanding between Ireland and the UK based on
their common history. Over time, some of the rights came to be included in
different pieces of legislation in both Ireland and the UK.

While the Common Travel Area is recognised under the Treaty of Amsterdam, it
is not dependant on the [ European Union ](/en/government-in-ireland/european-
government/european-union/european-union/) and the continuing membership of
both countries.

On 8 May 2019, the Irish and UK governments signed a [ Memorandum of
Understanding (pdf)
](https://www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/eu/brexit/brexitandyou/Memorandum-of-
Understanding-Ire-version.pdf) reaffirming the Common Travel Area and
identifying the rights and privileges of Irish and UK citizens within the CTA.
It also reaffirmed the [ commitment to maintain the CTA following Brexit (pdf)
