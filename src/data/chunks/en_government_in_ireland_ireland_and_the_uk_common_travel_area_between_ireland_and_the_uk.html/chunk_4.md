##  Border control and the Common Travel Area

There are no routine passport controls in operation for Irish and UK citizens
travelling between the 2 countries.

However, you must show identification to board a ferry or an airplane, and
some airlines and sea carriers only accept a passport as valid identification.
You may also be asked by an immigration officer to prove that you are a
citizen of Ireland or the UK, so you should carry a passport with you. You can
also use an Irish passport card, or other proof that you are an Irish citizen.

If you have family members who are not UK or EEA citizens, they may need a [
visa to enter Ireland ](/en/moving-country/visas-for-ireland/visa-
requirements-for-entering-ireland/) or the UK. A [ residency scheme
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/coming-to-join-family-in-ireland/joining-
your-uk-national-family-member/#eligible) for family members of UK citizens [
who move to Ireland after 1 January 2021
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/government-in-ireland/ireland-and-the-
uk/residence-rules-UK-citizens/#l5a1aa) is now in place.

The Common Travel Area also involves some co-operation on immigration issues.
A non-EEA national, for example, may be refused permission to enter Ireland if
they intend to travel onwards to the UK and they would not qualify for
admission to the UK. Irish immigration officers have the power to carry out
checks on people arriving in the State from the UK and to refuse them entry to
the State on the same grounds that apply to people arriving from outside the
Common Travel Area. These checks are carried out selectively.
