###  Additional powers

The President has 2 further powers in relation to legislation, which have
never been exercised to date.

**Proposals of national importance** : Under Article 27 of the Constitution,
the President may refuse to sign a Bill if a majority of the members of the
Seanad and at least one-third of the members of the Dáil petition the
President not to sign it, on the grounds that the Bill contains a proposal of
such national importance that the will of the people should be found out. The
President must consult with the [ Council of State
](https://president.ie/en/the-president/council-of-state) before deciding
whether or not to sign the Bill.

In this situation, if the President decides not to sign the Bill, [ an
ordinary referendum ](/en/government-in-ireland/elections-and-
referenda/national-elections/constitutional-referendum-in-ireland#la4a6f) is
held. To date, no ordinary referendum has taken place.

**Referring Money Bills** : The President also has a power in relation to
possible Money Bills, which are Bills that relate to taxation or to Government
spending.

Under Article 22 of the Constitution, if the Dáil and Seanad disagree about
whether or not a particular Bill is a Money Bill, the Seanad may ask the
President to refer the question to a Committee of Privileges. This is a
special committee appointed by the President, consisting of an equal number of
members of the Dáil and Seanad and a chaired by a Supreme Court judge.

The President must consult with the Council of State before deciding whether
or not to appoint a Committee of Privileges.
