###  Making appointments

Under [ Article 13 (1) of the Constitution
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#part3) , the President has
an important role in appointing people to various offices of State. In
addition to appointing the Taoiseach nominated by Dáil Éireann, for instance,
it is the role of the President to appoint the TDs nominated by the Taoiseach
as Government Ministers.

The President also appoints the [ Attorney General ](/en/government-in-
ireland/how-government-works/national-government/the-attorney-general/) , the
legal adviser to the Government (who is nominated by the Taoiseach) and the [
Comptroller and Auditor General ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/standards-and-accountability/comptroller-and-auditor-general/) , who is
nominated by Dáil Éireann. The Government nominates [ judges
](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) for the various [ courts ](/en/justice/courts-
system/courts/) throughout the State and the President then appoints them.
