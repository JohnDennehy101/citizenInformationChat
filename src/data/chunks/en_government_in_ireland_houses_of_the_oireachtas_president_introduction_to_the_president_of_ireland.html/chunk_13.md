###  Signing bills into law

When a [ Bill ](/en/government-in-ireland/houses-of-the-
oireachtas/legislation/) , a proposal for legislation, has been passed by both
Houses of the Oireachtas, it is presented to the President for signature. It
will only become law when the President has signed it.

In general, the President must sign a Bill on the fifth, sixth or seventh day
after it is presented. However, if [ Seanad Éireann ](/en/government-in-
ireland/houses-of-the-oireachtas/the-seanad/) agrees, the Government may ask
for the Bill to be signed sooner. Once the Bill has been signed, the President
must publish a notice in [ Iris Oifigiúil (the official State gazette)
](http://www.irisoifigiuil.ie/) stating that the Bill has become law.
