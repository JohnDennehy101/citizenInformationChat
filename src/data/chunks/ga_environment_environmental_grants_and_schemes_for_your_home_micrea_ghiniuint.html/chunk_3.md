##  What is the Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS)?

The Micro-generation Support Scheme allows homes, businesses, farms and
community buildings to sell any excess electricity they produce from solar
panels back to the grid.

If you sell excess renewable energy to the grid, you get a payment known as a
Clean Export Guarantee (CEG).

The amount you get paid depends on your energy provider.
