###  All other employment permits

Your family member must apply for an employment permit to work. They cannot
apply for a Dependent/Spouse/Partner Employment Permit. Instead, they must
apply for another [ category of employment permit ](/en/moving-
country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/overview-employment-permits/) .
This means the job must satisfy the criteria for the permit.
