###  General Employment Permit and Intra-Corporate Transferee (ICT) Permit
holders

From 15 May 2024, you can [ work without an employment permit
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/attention-eligible-spouses-and-partners-of-
general-employment-permit-and-intra-corporate-transferee-irish-employment-
permit-holders/) if you are the spouse or de-facto partner of a General
Employment Permit (GEP) holder or an Intra-Corporate Transferee (ICT) permit
holder and you are currently living in Ireland with a Stamp 3 immigration
permission. This change does not apply to a spouse or partner in Ireland on
other immigration permissions (for example, student or visitor) or to any
other dependents.

You do not need to get a new IRP until your current Irish Residence Permit
(IRP) expires and you do not need to attend your local immigration office. You
can use [ Stamp 3 to 1G notice for employers (pdf)
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Notice-to-
Employers-Stamp-3.pdf) to show employers that you have permission to work in
Ireland without an employment permit. When your current IRP card expires and
you renew it, you will be issued with a Stamp 1G.

If a spouse or partner is not currently living in Ireland, and they are given
permission to live in Ireland with the GEP or ICT holder, then they will get a
Stamp 1G allowing them to work without an employment permit.

Your other dependents have to apply for an [ employment permit ](/en/moving-
country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/overview-employment-permits/) if
they want to work in Ireland.
