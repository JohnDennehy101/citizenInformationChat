###  Critical Skills Employment Permits (CSEP), researchers on a Hosting
Agreement and doctors with Stamp 1H

Your spouse or partner can get a Stamp 1G IRP when they register. This gives
them the right to work without an employment permit.

Your other dependents can apply for a [ Dependant/Spouse/Partner Employment
Permit ](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-
Skills/Employment-Permits/Permit-Types/Dependant-Partner-Spouse-Employment-
Permit/) . This employment permit makes it easier for dependents to access
employment because:

  * Employers do not have to satisfy the [ labour market needs test ](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/work-permits#l27fdb)
  * The dependant can apply for any job vacancy except that of a domestic operative 
  * Applications and renewals are free of charge 
  * Pay must be at or above the [ National Minimum Wage ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/pay-and-employment/minimum-wage/)
