##  Can my family join me in Ireland?

Your family does not have an automatic right to join an employment permit
holder in Ireland, unless they are citizens of the EEA (the EU, plus Iceland,
Norway and Lichtenstein), the UK or Switzerland.

Immigration Service Delivery (ISD - the Irish immigration authority) has a [
family reunification policy ](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-
content/uploads/2021/04/Policy-document-on-Non-EEA-family-reunification.pdf) ,
which sets out rules for how families from outside the EEA, UK and Switzerland
can join people who live in Ireland. The policy includes people who live in
Ireland as holders of an employment permit. You can sponsor applications for
your family to join you in Ireland if you have an employment permit and
satisfy conditions that are set out below.

You do not have to be married for a particular period of time. For de facto
partnerships, you must be able to show that you have been in the relationship
for at least 2 years.
