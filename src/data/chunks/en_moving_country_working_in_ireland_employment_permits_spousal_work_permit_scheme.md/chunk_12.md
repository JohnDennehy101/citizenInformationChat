###  Older children

Older children (over 18) may be able to join you in Ireland if you can show
that they are wholly dependent on you. If they cannot work because of an
illness or disability, they should include details in their visa application.
Older children who are able to work and support themselves in the country
where they live, or have other family members who can support them, are less
likely to be approved. The decision is based on the individual circumstances
of the applicant.
