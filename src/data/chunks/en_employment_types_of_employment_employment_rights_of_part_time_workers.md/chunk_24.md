##  The laws on part-time work

The law on part-time work is set out in the [ Protection of Employees (Part-
Time Work) Act 2001
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0045/index.html) . This Act
applies to all part-time workers, including casual workers.

Part-time employees’ entitlements are generally in proportion ( _pro-rata
basis_ ) to full-time employees’ entitlements. This means that they should be
in proportion to your hours.

of:
