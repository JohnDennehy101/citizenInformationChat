##  Less favourable treatment

Employers cannot treat a part-time employee less favourably compared to full-
time employees, unless there are valid, objective reasons for doing so (known
as _objective justification_ or _objective grounds_ ).

You can be treated less favourably in relation to pensions, but only in very
specific circumstances â€“ see below.
