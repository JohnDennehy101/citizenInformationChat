###  Pensions and part-time workers

Part-time workers should generally have the same access to pension benefits.

However, if you work less than 20% of the normal hours of full-time employees,
your employer does not have to give you the same pension benefits as the full-
time employee.

However, your employer can choose to give you the same pension benefits as a
full-time worker if they want to.
