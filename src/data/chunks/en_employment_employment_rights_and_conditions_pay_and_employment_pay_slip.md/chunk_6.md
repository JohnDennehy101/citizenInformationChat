##  Mistakes on your payslip

If you think your pay is wrong, speak to your employer first to try to sort
out the problem informally. Ask them to explain anything you donâ€™t understand
on your payslip, or why you have not been paid.

Your employer is allowed to make a mistake or forget to include something on
your payslip, once they can show it was unintentional or because of an
administrative error.

If you have been overpaid by mistake, your employer will usually take back the
extra money in your next payment.

If your employer does not give you a payslip, or they give you a payslip that
is intentionally made-up or false, they have committed an offence and can get
a [ fixed payment notice
