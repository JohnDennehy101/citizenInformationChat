###  Deductions for uniforms or employee errors

Some employers deduct pay if they supply you with a service as part of the
job, for example, a uniform. They may also deduct pay if they suffer a loss
because of something that is your fault, such as a breakage or till shortage.

In these cases, a deduction is only allowed if:

  * Your contract says they can 
  * It is fair and reasonable 
  * You get written notice it must be at least a week's notice if it is due to your mistake 
  * The deduction is no more than the loss or cost of the service 
  * The deduction takes place **within 6 months** of the loss or cost
