##  Child Rescue Ireland Alert (CRI Alert)

A [ Child Rescue Alert (pdf) ](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-
us/publications/policy-documents/child-rescue-ireland-cri-alert-policy-
document.pdf) is used to alert the public to a child abduction and to appeal
for help. It is based on an agreement between the Gardaí, the media (including
some social media networks) and broadcasters and is designed to get
information about a missing child out to the public as soon as possible. The
Gardaí may issue a CRI Alert where:

  * The child is under 18 
  * There is a reasonable belief that the child was abducted 
  * There is a reasonable belief that there is an immediate and serious risk to the health and wellbeing of the child 
  * There is enough information for the public to be able to help the Gardaí in finding the child 

The Garda Press Office issues frequent updates on a CRI alert until the Alert
is cancelled.
