##  Introduction

Many people are reported missing each year in Ireland. In most cases, going
missing does not involve a crime.

An adult may choose to leave home without telling anyone for a number of
reasons:

  * To escape domestic violence 
  * To take some time out because they are struggling to cope 
  * Because they are angry or upset 
  * Because they feel they have nowhere to turn 

You can report a person missing if you cannot contact them and you are
concerned about their safety or wellbeing. You do not have to wait 24 hours
before making a report.
