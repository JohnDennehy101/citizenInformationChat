##  How to report a missing person

You report a person missing by contacting the Gardaí. They will ask you for
information about the missing person, including:

  * Their full name 
  * Their place and date of birth 
  * A description of them 
  * Details of where and when they were last seen 
  * A list of their friends, relatives and colleagues 
  * A list of places where they often go 
  * Their bank and credit card details 
  * Details of medications they use 
  * Details of social media accounts they use 
  * Their mobile phone number 

You should also give the Gardaí a recent photograph of the missing person – in
electronic format if possible.
