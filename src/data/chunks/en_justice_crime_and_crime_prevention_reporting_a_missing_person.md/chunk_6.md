##  Missing persons abroad

If a friend or relative has gone missing in another country, you should still
report it to the Gardaí. The Gardaí can report the case to Interpol who can
coordinate searches for missing persons internationally.

The [ Irish embassy or consulate ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/)
in the country where the person was last seen can put you in touch with
authorities and organisations that can help with a search. It cannot
investigate or carry out searches. This is the responsibility of the local
police forces.

EU and international agreements are in place to coordinate policing [ when a
child is abducted and taken abroad ](/en/birth-family-relationships/services-
