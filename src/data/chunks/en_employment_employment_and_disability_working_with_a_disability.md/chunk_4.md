###  Supports and training

There are support schemes and training opportunities available to you if you
have a disability and are looking for work.

These include help finding a job and preparation for training programmes and
employment support provided by the Department of Social Protection under the [
Work and Access employment programme ](/en/employment/employment-and-
disability/work-and-access-programme/) .

You can also do specific skills training and traineeships if you are
unemployed and are re-entering the workforce. Training for people in
employment is offered through apprenticeships and in-company training.

If you are completing a training course and need more intensive support than
would normally be available, the course will be delivered by specialist
training providers. Some key features of specialist training include adapted
equipment, a more individual approach and longer training sessions.
