###  **If you develop a disability**

If you develop a disability while in your job (through an accident or illness)
discuss your options with your employer.

Depending on your disability and job type, you may need workplace adaptations
or special equipment.

If returning to your previous job is not possible, explore other employment
options mentioned under ‘Looking for work’ above.
