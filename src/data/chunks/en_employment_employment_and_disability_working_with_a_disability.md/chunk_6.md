###  Disability payments and work

If you get certain disability payments, such as [ Disability Allowance (DA)
](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/disability-allowance/) and [ Blind
Pension (BP), ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-illness/blind-persons-
pension/) you may be allowed to [ work and keep your payment. ](/en/social-
welfare/social-welfare-payments-and-work/disability-payments-and-work/)

Employers can apply for the [ Wage Subsidy Scheme ](/en/employment/employment-
and-disability/wage-subsidy-scheme-for-people-with-disabilities/) whether or
not an employee keeps their entitlement to DA or BP.

If you are getting an [ Illness Benefit ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/illness-benefit/) or [ Invalidity Pension ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/invalidity-pension/) and you want to return to
work, you may qualify for [ Partial Capacity Benefit. ](/en/social-
welfare/disability-and-illness/partial-capacity-benefit/)

**Employment schemes**

Several [ employment schemes ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/schemes-to-support-employment/) and
supports encourage long-term unemployed people to return to work. Each scheme
has different rules, so it is important to check the detailed information
about each scheme so check the specific details and how they may affect your
social welfare payment.

**Other employment support**

If you want to [ start your own business ](/en/employment/types-of-
employment/self-employment/starting-a-business/) , you may be eligible for the
[ Back to Work Enterprise Allowance ](/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments-and-work/back-to-work-enterprise-allowance/) . The scheme encourages
unemployed people, lone parents and people getting Disability Allowance or
Blind Person's Pension to take up self-employment.
