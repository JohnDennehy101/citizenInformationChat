##  What do I do if I see a vacant home?

If you notice a vacant home in your area, you can report it to your local
authority using the online form on [ vacanthomes.ie ](https://vacanthomes.ie/)
.

The local authority will investigate and, if appropriate, work to bring the
vacant home back into use.
