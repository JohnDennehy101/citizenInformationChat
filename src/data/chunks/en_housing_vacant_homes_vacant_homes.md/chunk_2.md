##  What is a vacant home?

A vacant home is a home which does not have anyone living in it. For example,
a vacant home could be a:

  * Rental property that is not being rented 
  * Property that is for sale and is vacant 
  * Property where the owner has died and the home is in probate 
  * Property that is being refurbished 

As well as contributing to homelessness, vacant properties can have a negative
impact on communities and their surrounding areas. They can lead to:

  * Neighbourhood decline 
  * Deterioration and dereliction 
  * Vandalism 
  * Social and environmental problems 

As part of the Governmentâ€™s [ Housing for All plan
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ef5ec-housing-for-all-a-new-housing-plan-
for-ireland/) , they aim to reduce the number of vacant homes to increase
housing supply in Ireland and help reduce homelessness.

This is outlined in detail in Pathway 4 of the Housing for All plan, [
Addressing Vacancy and Efficient Use of Existing Stock (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/197161/c8410c74-95ce-40fb-
