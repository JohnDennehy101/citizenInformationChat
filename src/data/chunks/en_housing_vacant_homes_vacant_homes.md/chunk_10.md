###  **Repair and Leasing Scheme**

The purpose of the [ Repair and Leasing Scheme ](/en/housing/housing-grants-
and-schemes/local-authority-housing-grants-and-supports/repair-and-leasing-
scheme/) is to bring vacant properties in need of repair, back into use for
social housing. The scheme is aimed at people who own vacant properties.

If your vacant property is suitable for social housing, your local authority
or [ approved housing body (AHB)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) will pay to have it repaired. Then, you
lease, or make the property available, to the local authority or AHB, who will
use it for social housing.
