##  Charges for mental health services

You have the same entitlement to [ public health services for mental illness
](/en/health/health-services/mental-health/mental-health-services/) as for any
other illness.

If you are going to a private psychiatric hospitals you will be charged. [
Health insurance companies ](/en/health/health-system/private-health-
insurance/) sometimes treat psychiatric hospital costs differently from
general hospital costs.

The same rules apply to long-term institutional care for psychiatric patients
as to long-term institutional care for other patients.

Out-patient services for mental illness are provided free of charge to
children aged under 16 years.
