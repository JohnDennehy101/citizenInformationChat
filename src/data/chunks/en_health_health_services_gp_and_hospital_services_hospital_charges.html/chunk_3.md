##  Are public hospitals free in Ireland?

Public in-patient and day service fees were abolished on 17 April 2023. This
means that the daily charge for staying in hospital for public patients no
longer applies from this date.

COVID-19 is a prescribed infectious disease so you do not have to pay
emergency department (A&E) charges or in-patient charges if you are getting
treatment for [ COVID-19
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/covid19/covid19_overview.html) .

If you donâ€™t live in Ireland ( [ ordinarily resident ](/en/health/health-
system/entitlement-to-public-health-services/) ) and you do not belong to any
of the groups that can get free health services, you have to pay the full cost
of the bed, whether it is a public bed or a private bed. You also have to pay
the consultant.  

The HSE has the discretion to reduce or waive the charges in cases of
hardship.
