##  Out-patient services

You can be referred by your family doctor to the **out-patients** department
of a public hospital for specialist assessment by a consultant or their team
or for diagnostic assessments (for example, x-rays, laboratory tests,
physiotherapy).

If you have an out-patient appointment you will not be staying overnight in
the hospital.
