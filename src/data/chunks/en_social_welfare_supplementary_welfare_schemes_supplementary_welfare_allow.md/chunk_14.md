##  Rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance

The basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) is made up of a personal rate
for you (the applicant) and additional amounts for any adult dependant and
child dependant.

A child dependant is a person under the age of 18 who lives with you and
depends on you for financial support. If you have been getting SWA for at
least 26 weeks, the age limit is 22 for a child dependant in full-time
education or up to the end of the academic year after their 22nd birthday.
