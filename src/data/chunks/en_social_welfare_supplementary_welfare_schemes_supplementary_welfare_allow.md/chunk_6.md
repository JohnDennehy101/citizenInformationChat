###  Habitual Residency Condition

EU/EEA and Swiss migrant workers who have been working in Ireland and have the
right to reside here can access basic SWA and supplements without having to
meet the habitual residency condition.

However, people from the EU/EEA or Switzerland who move to Ireland in search
of employment are subject to the habitual residence condition in the normal
way while looking for work.
