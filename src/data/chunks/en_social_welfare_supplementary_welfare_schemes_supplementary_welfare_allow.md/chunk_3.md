##  Who can get Supplementary Welfare Allowance?

If you have no income, you may get a basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance
(SWA).

If your weekly income is below the Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate for
your family size, a payment may be made to bring your income up to the
Supplementary Welfare Allowance rate for your family.

If you applied for a social welfare payment or pension but it has not yet been
paid and you have no other income, you may get SWA while you are waiting for
your payment. However, the amount paid while you are waiting will be deducted
from the arrears of your social welfare payment.

If you have returned to work, you can claim the basic SWA for up to 30 days
while you are waiting for your wages.
