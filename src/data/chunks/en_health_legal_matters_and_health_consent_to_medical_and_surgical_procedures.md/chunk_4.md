###  If there is no consent

If a person carries out medical or surgical procedures without consent, they
could be charged with the crime of assault - the decision on charges is made
by the Director of Public Prosecutions.

They could also be sued for the torts (civil wrongs) of assault and/or battery
and possibly for breach of constitutional rights. If the person involved is a
medical professional, they could also be sued for negligence. The patient may
take these actions.
