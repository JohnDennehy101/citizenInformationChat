##  Refusal of medical treatment

It is clear that, if you are an adult with capacity, you have the right to
refuse or discontinue medical treatment even if the inevitable consequence is
that you will die. This is different from taking positive measures to end your
own life or another person's life.

If you are not mentally competentdo not have capacity, you are not in a
position to make a decision about refusing or discontinuing medical treatment.
The law is not clear on exactly who is competent to do this. In general, a
medical professional may make decisions that the treatment should be
discontinued for medical reasons.

An [ Advance Healthcare Directive ](/en/health/legal-matters-and-
health/advance-care-directives/) is a document in which a person sets out
their wishes about the continuation or otherwise of medical treatment if they
should become mentally incapable.

An Advance Healthcare Directive may be valid and enforceable because, by
making it, you may have withdrawn your consent to specific medical or surgical
treatment. It is not possible to state with absolute certainty that such a
directive would be enforced because this depends on exactly what it says and
whether or not it addresses the precise circumstances you face.
