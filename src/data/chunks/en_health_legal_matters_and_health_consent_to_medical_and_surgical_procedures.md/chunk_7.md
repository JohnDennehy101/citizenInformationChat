##  Children

In general, children aged 16 or over may themselves give consent to surgical,
medical or dental procedures, without requiring the consent of their parents
or guardians. This is provided for in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the
Person Act 1997.

It is the practice to get parental consent to medical procedures for children
under that age, even though it is not entirely clear that parents have the
ultimate decision. However, a child’s views should also be sought and, in the
limited cases where a medical professional believes the child is sufficiently
capable of making the decision, their consent should be sought.

Generally, a medical professional cannot override the requirement for parental
consent for a young child. However, the best interests of the child is the
fundamental guiding principle and the requirement for parental consent may be
overridden where the child’s life is at risk.

Like other medical procedures, a child aged 16 or over may consent to having
an abortion. However, the doctor providing the service must be confident that
the child fully understands the information in order to give a valid consent.
A child aged 16 or over, but under the age of 18, will normally be encouraged
to involve their parents or another supportive adult. However, if the child is
over 16 they can choose not to involve an adult.

In exceptional circumstances, a child aged 15 or under can choose to have an
abortion and not involve her parents or another supportive adult if the doctor
believes the child is capable of consenting, following an appropriate
assessment.
