##  Introduction

You must separate your household waste. In Ireland, you can [ recycle most
household waste ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/recycling-domestic-waste/) . You have to recycle organic material
like food and garden waste separately from [ general household rubbish
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/domestic-refuse/) and other recyclable items.

Recycling food and garden (organic) waste reduces the amount of biodegradable
waste sent to [ landfill
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/landfill-sites/) . It also reduces the amount of household waste you
put into landfill or general rubbish, so you will pay lower bin charges if you
recycle your food and garden waste.

You should not use a macerator to dispose of food waste into the sewerage
system or put food waste in the general waste collection.
