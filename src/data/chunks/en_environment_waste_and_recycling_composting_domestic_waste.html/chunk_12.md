####  Tips for composting

  * Protect the compost from heavy rain. If the compost becomes waterlogged, it will stop decomposing. 
  * You can add activators to your bin if you want to speed up the composting process, but they are not strictly necessary. 
  * Start your compost in the spring, summer or autumn, as composting slows or stops in winter.
