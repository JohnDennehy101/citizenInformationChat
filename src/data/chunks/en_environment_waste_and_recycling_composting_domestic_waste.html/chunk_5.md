###  **What can go in the brown bin?**

**You can put all food waste except cooking oils into the brown bin.** This
even includes dairy products, eggs, raw and cooked meat, fish and bones.

You can also put food-soiled paper napkins, paper towels and pizza boxes into
the brown bin with your household food waste.

Look out for the [ seedling logo ](https://repak.ie/recycling/recycling-
symbols/#:~:text=This%20symbol%20indicates%20that%20a%20product,garden%20waste%20through%20your%20local%20authority)
on packaging and coffee cups. This symbol will look like a sprouting plant and
means that the product is certified as compostable. This should be placed in a
brown bin or brought to a civic amenity centre if they offer a composting
service. It should never be placed in a green recycling bin.

Waste from your garden can also be put in the brown bin, for example grass
clippings and leaves.

Some bin collection companies may need you to separate garden brown bin waste
from food brown bin waste. Check with your bin collection company.
