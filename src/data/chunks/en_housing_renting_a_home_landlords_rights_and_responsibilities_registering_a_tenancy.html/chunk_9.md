###  Registration fees for private, student-specific and cost rental tenancies

The basic fee for registering a private rented, student-specific or cost
rental tenancy with the RTB is €40 a year. This applies if the RTB gets the
completed application within a month of the start of the tenancy. There is a
late fee of €10 per month for each month that the registration is late.

If you are registering up to 10 tenancies in the same building at the same
time, you can pay a combined fee of €170, if you register on time.
