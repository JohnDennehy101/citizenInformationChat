You can register a tenancy online or by post or email.

You register online using [ the RTB’s online system
](https://www.rtb.ie/portal) . You need to create an RTB online account before
you can register a tenancy. You can get [ information on the RTB’s website
about how to do this ](https://www.rtb.ie/info-hub) . If you need to create an
online account for an approved housing body (AHB) you should contact [
AHB@rtb.ie ](mailto:AHB@rtb.ie) .

To register a tenancy by post or email download the [ Tenancy Registration
Application Form (pdf)

There is a different process for registering tenancies in student-specific
accommodation. See the [ RTB’s website ](https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-
compliance/registrations/student-specific-accommodation) for information on
how to do this.

When a tenancy has been registered and the fees paid the RTB will send letters
to the landlord and tenants confirming that the tenancy has been registered.
