##  How do I know if my tenancy is registered?

You can view the [ public register ](https://www.rtb.ie/about-rtb/news/rtb-
publishes-q2-2022-rent-index) to check that your tenancy has been registered.
The RTB can take action against landlords who do not register tenancies. Read
more on the [ RTB’s website ](https://www.rtb.ie/register-a-tenancy/why-
register/penalties-for-not-registering) .

Even if your landlord hasn’t registered your tenancy, you can still use the [
RTB’s dispute resolution service ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/resolving-
disputes/disputes-between-landlords-and-tenants/) . Landlords can only use
this service if they have registered the tenancy.
