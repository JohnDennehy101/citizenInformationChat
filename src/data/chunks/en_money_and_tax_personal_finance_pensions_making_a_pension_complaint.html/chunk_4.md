##  Time limits for making a complaint

If you are making a complaint to the FSPO about something that has happened,
you must make it within:

  * 6 years from the date it happened 
  * 3 years from the date that you became aware, or should have become aware, of it 

The Ombudsman can choose to consider a complaint or dispute outside these
timeframes.
