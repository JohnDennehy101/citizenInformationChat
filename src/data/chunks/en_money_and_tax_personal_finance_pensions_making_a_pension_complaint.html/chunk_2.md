##  Introduction

The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) has the power to
investigate and decide on complaints about [ occupational pension schemes
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/occupational-pensions/) , [
Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/personal-retirement-savings-accounts/) and [ Retirement
Annuity Contracts (RACs) ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/pensions/personal-pensions/) .

The Ombudsman has the power to give directions to resolve the complaint or
dispute. It can give financial compensation (redress) but this cannot exceed
the actual loss of benefit under the occupational pension scheme, PRSA or RAC.

The Ombudsman does not have the power to award legal costs. All decisions made
by the Ombudsman are binding between the parties. Either party has a right to
appeal the decision to the [ High Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-
court/) .
