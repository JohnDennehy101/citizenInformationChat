##  Fees

There is no charge to bring a complaint to the FSPO. If you choose to hire a
solicitor or other professional to bring a complaint to the FSPO on your
behalf, then you will have to pay their fees.

If you appeal the Ombudsmanâ€™s decision to the High Court and you are not
successful, you may have to pay all the legal costs.
