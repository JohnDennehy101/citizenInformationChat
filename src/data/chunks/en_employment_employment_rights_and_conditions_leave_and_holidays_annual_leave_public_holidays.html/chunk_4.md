##  How much annual leave and holiday pay am I entitled to?

Your annual leave entitlement depends on how much time you have worked in a
_leave year_ .

The statutory leave year runs from 1 April to 31 March. Many employers use the
calendar year (January to December) instead of the statutory leave year for
administrative reasons but this does not affect your statutory leave
entitlements.
