##  What is annual leave?

Annual leave (also called _holidays from work_ ) is paid time off work. All
employees are entitled to annual leave, including full-time, part-time,
temporary and casual workers.

Most employees are entitled to 4 weeksâ€™ annual leave each year. This is set
out in the [ Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/20/section/19/enacted/en/html)
and is known as your _statutory entitlement_ . Your employer might give you
more annual leave. You can check your entitlement to annual leave in your [
contract of employment ](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/contracts-of-employment/contract-of-employment/) .
