###  What if I get sick while on annual leave?

If you are sick while you are on annual leave, you should get a medical
certificate from your GP (doctor) as soon as possible to cover the days you
were sick. Give the medical certificate to your employer as soon as you return
to work.

This way, the _sick days_ will not count as annual leave, and you can take
your annual leave at a later date. Your employer cannot make you to take
annual leave for time you were on certified sick leave.
