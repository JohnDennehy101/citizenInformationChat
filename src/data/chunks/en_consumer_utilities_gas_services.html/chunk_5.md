##  What happens if I move house?

If you are moving into a property that already has a gas connection, you
should contact a gas supplier to set up a new service account. Give your gas
supplier a meter reading as soon as possible. If you are renting, your
landlord can contact the gas supplier for you.

To avoid the meter being locked or disconnected before you move in, tell the
supplier as soon as possible that there will be a change of ownership or
occupier.

You do not have to pay for any gas used by the previous occupier.

If you are an existing natural gas customer and you are moving home or want to
close your account, contact your supplier in advance to provide a closing
meter reading, your new address and the name of the new occupant (if known).
If you do not do this, you will be responsible for any gas used at the
property.
