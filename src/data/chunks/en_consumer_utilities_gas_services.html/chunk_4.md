##  Will I need to pay a security deposit?

Your gas supplier is allowed to charge a deposit. Each supplier has its own
deposit policy, which must be fair, transparent and reasonable. The deposit
must be returned in the bill that you receive after your contract ends (your
contract is usually 12 months). Your supplier must tell you if you are at risk
of losing your deposit and describe the steps you should take to improve your
credit terms.

If you are on a low income and cannot afford to pay a deposit, check if you
are eligible for [ help ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-
schemes/supplementary-welfare-allowance-scheme/) from your local INTREO
office.
