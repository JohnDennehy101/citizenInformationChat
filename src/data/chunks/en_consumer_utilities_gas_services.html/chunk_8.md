##  Rules suppliers must follow

The [ Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) ](https://www.cru.ie/) is
the regulator of the gas industry.

The CRU has a role to protect energy customers and to promote competition. It
does this by putting in place a rulebook called the [ Supplier Handbook (pdf)
](https://cruie-live-96ca64acab2247eca8a850a7e54b-5b34f62.divio-
media.com/documents/CRU202324_Electricity_and_Gas_Suppliers_Handbook_2023_.pdf)
. Suppliers must have [ codes of practices ](https://www.cru.ie/home/customer-
care/energy/customer-protection/#supplier-codes-of-practice) covering how they
will deal with consumers.

The codes must cover:

  * Billing 
  * Disconnections 
  * Customer sign-up 
  * Marketing and advertising 
  * Complaints handling 
  * Vulnerable customers 
  * Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) and budget controllers 
  * Non-domestic customers 

Suppliers must have Customer Charters setting out:

  * Guaranteed service levels for their customers 
  * Compensation and refund arrangements when service quality levels are not met. 

Every supplier must publish its customer charter and codes on its website.
