##  How can I safely dispose of my waste?

Most areas have an organised [ household waste collection
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/domestic-refuse/) service. If you decide not to use an organised
waste collection service, you can dispose of most of your domestic waste by [
recycling ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/recycling-household-waste/) and [ home composting
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/waste-and-
recycling/composting-domestic-waste/) . You can also use civic amenity centres
or [ landfill sites ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/waste-
and-recycling/landfill-sites/) .

Your [ local authority ](https://www.housingagency.ie/find-my-local-authority)
can advise you on waste disposal and recycling facilities in your area.

For farmyard plastics, you can bring them to a [ bring centre
](https://farmplastics.ie/bring-centres/) or else [ organise a collection
](https://farmplastics.ie/farmyard-collections/) . You can read more about
what to do with farmyard plastics at [ farmplastics.ie
