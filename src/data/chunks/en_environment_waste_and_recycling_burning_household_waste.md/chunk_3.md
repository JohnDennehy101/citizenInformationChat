###  **Why is burning waste illegal?**

Burning waste in your home or garden can release toxic dioxins into the air.
This can affect the air around you and may upset your neighbours.

For example, paper waste can contain synthetic materials and disposable
nappies contain gels, bleaches and plastics.

As well as contaminating the air, the by-products of low-temperature,
uncontrolled fires can become airborne and can then fall on and contaminate
near-by soil and vegetation.

Fires can also get out of control very easily. If you see any out of control
or unattended fires, you should report it to the Fire and Emergency Services
on 112 or 999.
