##  Controlled fires and burning vegetation

Landowners sometimes use controlled burning as a way of managing land, for
example, by burning off old vegetation to promote new grass growth.

Landowners can carry out controlled fires on uncultivated land from 1
September to the last day in February each year. This is only allowed if it is
done in a controlled manner and the landowner follows the correct safety
procedures. Uncultivated land is land which is not normally farmed or managed.
