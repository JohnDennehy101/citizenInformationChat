###  Prosecution

A Garda file is gathered with all relevant evidence and, depending on the
nature of the offence under investigation, it is sent to a senior Garda or to
the [ Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ](https://www.dppireland.ie/) for
a decision on whether or not to prosecute the case in court.

For less serious crimes, such as public order offences, some traffic offences
and minor assaults, the case is prosecuted by the Garda√≠ in the [ District
Court ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/district-
court/) .

For more serious crimes, the file is referred to the DPP who decides where and
[ whether to prosecute or not ](https://www.dppireland.ie/victims-
witnesses/how-we-make-prosecution-decisions/) . In these cases the prosecution
is carried out by the office of the DPP, usually in the [ Circuit Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/)
or [ Central Criminal Court
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) .
