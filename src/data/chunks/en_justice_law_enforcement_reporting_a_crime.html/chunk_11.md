##  What happens during an investigation?

A Garda investigation can involve a review of CCTV footage, the interviewing
of witnesses and scene of crime investigations including checking for
fingerprints. As part of the investigation, you may have to be interviewed or
have a medical examination but all such interventions should be kept to a
minimum.

If you are a victim, you have the right to ask the Garda√≠ to keep you informed
about significant developments in the investigation. However, you are not
entitled to any information that could interfere with the investigation or put
anyone in danger.

If any property is taken from you as part of the investigation, you should get
it back without delay, if possible. However, if it has to be used as [
evidence ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/evidence/evidence-
introduction/) in a [ criminal trial
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-
trial/criminal-trial/) , you might not get it back until the court case is
finished.
