##  Phoning the Gardaí and reporting a crime online

It helps the Gardaí if you give as much information as possible but you do not
have to give your name when reporting a crime. If you wish to provide
confidential information relating to crime or other activities, you can:

  * Contact the [ Garda Confidential Line ](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-us/useful-contact-numbers/) on 1800 666 111. 
  * Contact [ Crimestoppers ](https://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/WP15000275) on 1800 250 025. Staffed by members of the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Crimestoppers guarantees anonymity and offers cash rewards for information.
