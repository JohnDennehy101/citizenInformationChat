###  How to report drug dealing

You can safely and confidentially pass on information about drug dealing by
calling the [ Crimestoppers ](https://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/WP15000275)
freephone confidential number **1800 250** **025** or the [ Garda Confidential
](https://www.garda.ie/en/contact-us/useful-contact-numbers/) freephone number
**1800 666 111** .

You will speak to a trained operator who will ask you for the information you
have on drug dealing and nothing else. You will not be asked for your name.
Your phone number may be visible but it will not be traced or recorded.

The information gathered is passed on directly to the [ Garda National Drugs
and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) ](https://www.garda.ie/en/about-
us/organised-serious-crime/garda-national-drugs-and-organised-crime-bureau/)
which assesses its usefulness. The GNDOCB passes relevant information on to
the Gardaí in the specified area for investigation.

The Gardaí can use the information to build a case against a known drug
dealer, to investigate new allegations of drug dealing activity in a community
or to make an arrest.
