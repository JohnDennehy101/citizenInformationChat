##  If you want to do an ICT skills conversion course

An ICT skills conversion course is when you retrain to start a career in the
technology sector.

If you were getting Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance for at least
9 of the previous 12 months, you may get a [ Back to Education Allowance
](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/) while
participating on a one-year, full-time ICT skills conversion course.

You are not eligible for a 2-year part-time ICT conversion course if:

  * You are getting a jobseeker’s payment (including Farm Assist) 
  * You are a qualified adult of working age on someone else’s social welfare payment.
