###  Unemployed people

You do not have to pay any course fees or charges if you are unemployed.

If you take up a Springboard+ course, you can keep your existing social
welfare payment if you continue to fulfil the conditions for the payment. If
you have started a course and lose your qualifying social welfare payment, you
can continue your course.

If you are getting a jobseeker’s payment and participating on a part-time
Springboard+ course, you will continue to get your jobseeker’s payment under
the [ Part-Time Education Option (PTEO) ](/en/social-welfare/back-to-
education/part-time-education-option/) .

If you are getting a jobseeker’s payment and you are on a full-time course,
you may have the option to transfer to a [ Back to Education Allowance (BTEA)
](/en/social-welfare/back-to-education/back-to-education-allowance/) .

If you take up a job while on a course, Springboard+ will fund the fees for
the full academic year.

If your course extends into another academic year(s), the fees will be decided
by your college.
