If you are employed, you must pay 10% towards the course fee at Level 7, 8 and
9 on the NFQ. However, Level 6 courses are free.

If you are getting the [ Working Family Payment (WFP) ](/en/social-
welfare/families-and-children/working-family-payment/) , or if you are on a [
Community Employment Scheme ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/employment-support-schemes/community-employment-scheme/) at the
start of the course, you will not have to pay the 10% course fee contribution.
