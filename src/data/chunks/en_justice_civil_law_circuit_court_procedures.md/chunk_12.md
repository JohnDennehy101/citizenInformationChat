###  Inadequate particulars

If, say, the plaintiff refuses to reply to the notice for particulars or does
not give adequate replies, the defendant should write to them identifying the
inadequacies and warning of a court application.

If the plaintiff continues to refuse to provide the requested particulars, the
defendant may apply to court. If the court agrees that the defendant is
entitled to replies to the information requested, the court may order the
plaintiff to reply to the notice for particulars.

A notice for particulars may be sent by either party at any stage before the
trial.

The rules applying to notice for particulars are contained in [ Order 17 of
the Circuit Court Rules ](https://courts.ie/rules/particulars-and-further-
particulars-claim-or-defence) .
