##  Delivering the defence

The defendant must _deliver a defence_ to the plaintiff within 10 days of
entering an appearance. This means the defendant must send a [ notice called
Defence ](https://www.courts.ie/content/defence) to the plaintiffâ€™s solicitor.
The 10-day time limit is not strict and, in most cases, a defence can be
delivered after the time has expired.
