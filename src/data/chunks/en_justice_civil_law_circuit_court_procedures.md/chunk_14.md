##  Setting down for trial

When a defence has been delivered, the plaintiff can serve a [ notice of trial
](https://courts.ie/content/notice-trial) or a [ notice for the fixing of a
date for trial ](https://courts.ie/content/notice-fixing-date-trial) (in
Dublin), as directed by the County Registrar. Not less than 10 days’ notice of
trial should be given (21 days’ notice in Dublin), unless otherwise agreed,
and the notice should be filed at the Circuit Court office.

It is often the case that other applications are necessary before the action
can be set down for trial. These applications are known as interlocutory
applications.

If the plaintiff fails to serve notice of trial within 10 days of the delivery
of the defence, the defendant can serve notice of trial on the plaintiff.
Alternatively, the defendant can apply to the court to dismiss the action for
want of prosecution.

The rules applying to setting down for trial are contained in [ Order 33 of
the Circuit Court Rules ](https://courts.ie/rules/trial-0) .
