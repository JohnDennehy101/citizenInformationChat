##  Entering an appearance

When the defendant receives the Civil Bill, they should _enter an appearance_
within 10 days. Entering an appearance is a very important step as it
indicates in writing that the defendant intends to defend the proceedings. The
time limit is not strict and, in most cases, an appearance can be entered
after the time has expired.

To enter an appearance, the defendant must lodge an [ Entry of appearance form
](https://courts.ie/content/entry-appearance) at the Circuit Court office. A
copy of the form must also be given to the plaintiff or the plaintiff's
solicitor.
