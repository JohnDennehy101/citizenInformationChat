###  Judgment in default

If the defendant fails to enter an appearance, the plaintiff can apply to
court for _judgment in default of appearance_ . This means that because the
defendant, by failing to enter an Appearance, has failed to acknowledge the
proceedings and failed to indicate that they intend to defend them, the
plaintiff may obtain a judgement from the court against the defendant without
the need for a trial.

If the defendant does enter an appearance but fails to deliver a defence (see
below), the plaintiff may obtain a _judgement in default of defence_ from the
court against the defendant.
