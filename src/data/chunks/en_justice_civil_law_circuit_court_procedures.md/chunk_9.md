###  Defence content

There are no set rules about what must be contained in the Defence notice. The
document starts with the title of the proceedings.

It is up to the defendant to admit or deny the allegations that the plaintiff
has made in their Civil Bill. It is also up to the defendant to state any
specific defence that they are relying on. For example, if the defendant is
claiming that the plaintiff's claim has been brought outside of the mandatory
[ time limits ](/en/justice/civil-law/taking-and-appealing-a-civil-case/) ,
then the defendant should specifically plead that fact in the Defence.

If the plaintiff has made a specific allegation and the defendant fails to
deny that allegation in the Defence notice, it will be assumed that the
defendant is admitting that the allegation is true. For example, if the Civil
Bill claims that the plaintiff was involved in a road traffic accident and the
defence fails to deny that the road traffic accident occurred, then it is
assumed that the defendant is admitting that the road traffic accident
happened. It is not then necessary for the plaintiff to prove to the judge
that the accident occurred.

On the other hand, when the defendant specifically denies a claim that the
plaintiff has made, they are putting the plaintiff _on proof_ of the
allegation. This means that the plaintiff must prove that the claim is true.
For example, if the defendant specifically denies that the road traffic
accident occurred, the plaintiff must prove it by introducing evidence in
court.
