###  Counterclaim

When a defendant receives a Civil Bill, they may decide that not only have
they done nothing wrong and the claim should not have been brought against
them, but that they have a claim against the plaintiff. In those
circumstances, they may wish to include a _counterclaim_ with their defence.

To make a claim against the plaintiff, a section titled Counterclaim is added
to the Defence. This must clearly set out the allegations that the defendant
is making against the plaintiff and what the defendant seeks from the court.

The defendant must lodge the Defence with Counterclaim at the Circuit Court
office. A copy of the form must also be given to the plaintiff's solicitor.
