###  Serving the Civil Bill

After the Civil Bill has been prepared by the barrister, your solicitor will
take it to the [ Circuit Court office ](https://www.courts.ie/content/find-us)
to be _issued_ – this involves paying the stamp duty. After the stamp duty has
been paid, the Civil Bill is stamped and it is ready to be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s solicitor.

There are different ways to serve the Civil Bill:

  * You may hand a copy of the Civil Bill to the defendant personally 
  * If attempts to serve the defendant personally have been unsuccessful, a copy of the notice can be given to the respondent’s spouse, civil partner, child (if they live with the respondent), employee or agent at the respondent’s last known residence or workplace, as long as that person is not under 16 years of age 
  * You may send a copy by registered prepaid post to the defendant's last known residence or place of business 

The rules applying to the service of Civil Bills are contained in [ Order 11
of the Circuit Court Rules ](https://www.courts.ie/rules/issue-civil-bills-
