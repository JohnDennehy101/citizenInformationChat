###  Cash controls

Ireland has no restriction on the amount of cash you can carry in or out of
the country if you are travelling within the EU. There is also no requirement
to declare the cash in these situations. However, under the [ Criminal Justice
Act 1994 Section 38(1)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1994/en/act/pub/0015/sec0038.html#zza15y1994s38)
as amended by the [ Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005 Section 20
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2005/en/act/pub/0001/sec0020.html#sec20) , if
you are carrying at least â‚¬1,000 in cash, a customs officer can seize and
detain the money. The customs officer must have reasonable grounds to believe
that the cash is the proceeds of crime, or that it is to be used in criminal
conduct.
