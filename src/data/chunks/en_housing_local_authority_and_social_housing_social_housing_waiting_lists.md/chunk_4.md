###  Getting on the social housing list

When you [ apply for social housing
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/applying-for-local-authority-housing/) , the local authority assesses
your application to see if your household qualifies for social housing. If you
qualify, you’re placed on the social housing waiting list. If you have listed
an ‘area of choice’ in your application that is in another local authority
area, your local authority will notify the other local authority of this.
