##  What are social housing waiting lists?

Local authorities keep a record of people who are qualified for social housing
support and who have not received it. As social housing becomes available, the
local authority allocates it to people who are on its _record of qualified
households. The record of qualified households is_ more commonly known as the
social housing waiting list.

Before offering you accommodation, the local authority reviews its assessment
of your application for social housing support and confirms that your
household still qualifies. Local authorities must also review all applications
on their housing lists every year and prepare a [ summary report
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/social-housing-waiting-lists/#556f10) detailing the number of people
on the list in the area.

As well as the main housing lists, local authorities also maintain lists of
people who have [ applied for a transfer ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-
social-housing/getting-a-transfer-to-another-local-authority-home/) from their
current accommodation. There is also a transfer list for people on the [
Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-
renting/housing-assistance-payment/) who want to be considered for social
housing.
