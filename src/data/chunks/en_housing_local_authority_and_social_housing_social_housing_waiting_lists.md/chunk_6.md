###  Renting privately while waiting for social housing

If you are in private rented accommodation while waiting for local authority
housing, you may qualify for the [ Housing Assistance Payment (HAP)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-
renting/housing-assistance-payment/) . If you are housed under HAP, your
housing need will have been met and you will no longer be on the local
authorityâ€™s housing list. However, if you still want to be considered for
social housing you can apply to be placed on the local authority's transfer
list.

If you apply for a transfer **within 2 weeks of getting the letter confirming
your HAP payment** , any time that you spent on the housing list can be taken
into account when your local authority considers your application. If you
apply for a transfer at a later date, the time that you previously spent on
the housing list will not count.
