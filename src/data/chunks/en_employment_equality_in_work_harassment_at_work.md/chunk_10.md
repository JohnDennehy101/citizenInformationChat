###  If harassment has taken place

By law, your employer may be held responsible if harassment takes place
completely outside the course of your employment, but you are treated
differently at work because of your rejection or acceptance of the harassment.

If you bring a claim against your employer for harassment, your employer may
have a defence by showing that they took reasonably practical steps to prevent
the harassment from happening or to prevent you from being treated differently
at work.

You cannot be [ victimised ](/en/employment/enforcement-and-
redress/victimisation-at-work/) for bringing a claim under employment equality
legislation.
