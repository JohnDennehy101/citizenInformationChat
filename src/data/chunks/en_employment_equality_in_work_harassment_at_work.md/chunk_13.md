###  Formal complaint to your employer

Sometimes, an informal approach is not enough to resolve the issue. In
situations where the harassment continues, you may need to make a formal
complaint.

Check your employer's policy on harassment to find out:

  * What will happen when a formal complaint is made 
  * How the complaint will be investigated 
  * Who will carry out the investigation, taking into account issues of confidentiality and the rights of both parties
