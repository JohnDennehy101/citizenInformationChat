###  Informal approach

If you want to make a complaint about harassment, you should begin by telling
the person concerned that you find their behaviour, conduct or material
unacceptable and offensive.

If you find this uncomfortable or too difficult to do, you should ask a friend
or colleague, a designated person at work or a trade union representative to
approach the person on your behalf. Often, an informal approach like this will
resolve the issue.
