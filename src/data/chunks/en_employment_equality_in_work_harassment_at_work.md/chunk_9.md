##  Employer's obligations

Your employer should have a policy and procedures to deal with and prevent
harassment at work. The policy should set out what is unacceptable behaviour
at work. Your employer should also have an effective grievance or complaints
procedure in place to deal with complaints about harassment.

All employees must be made aware of the policy and procedures.

The [ Code of Practice on Sexual Harassment and Harassment at Work
](https://www.ihrec.ie/documents/code-of-practice-on-sexual-harassment-and-
harassment-at-work-2/) has practical guidance for employers and employees on
how to prevent harassment and sexual harassment at work, and how to put
procedures in place to deal with it. The Code is legally admissible in
evidence in proceedings before the courts, the WRC and the Labour Court.
