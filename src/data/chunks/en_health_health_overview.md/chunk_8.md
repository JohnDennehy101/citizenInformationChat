##  Local health centres

There are local health centers in each area that provide different health
services. The range of services provided varies in different areas but can
include nursing care, chiropody, speech therapy, physiotherapy, mental health
services and more.

You can access community health and personal social services through your [
Local Health Office ](http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/LHO/) .

Sometimes health services can be provided in your own home. If you aged 65 or
over or have a disability, you may be able to get support at home through the
[ Home Support Service ](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-older-
people/home-support-service/) .
