##  Introduction

Both private and public healthcare services are available in Ireland.

Private healthcare services are provided by individual health professionals or
healthcare companies. You usually pay the full cost of private health
services. You can take out [ private health insurance ](/en/health/health-
system/private-health-insurance/) to help meet the cost of private healthcare.

Public health services are supported by the State. Many public health services
are free of charge but in some cases there may be a fee.

The [ Health Service Executive (HSE) ](/en/health/health-system/health-
service-executive/) is responsible for the delivery of public health services.
Sometimes the HSE provides these services directly and sometimes the HSE funds
other organisations to provide these services.

You are covered by public health services if you have been living in Ireland
for at least a year or you intend to live here for at least one year. This is
called being [ ordinarily resident in Ireland ](/en/health/health-
system/entitlement-to-public-health-services/) .

[ Some visitors may be entitled to public health services ](/en/health/health-
system/health-services-and-visitors-to-ireland/) , for example, people from
other countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) or from Switzerland.

If you are resident in Ireland, you can [ access healthcare in Europe
