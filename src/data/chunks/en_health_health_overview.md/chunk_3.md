##  General Practitioners (family doctors)

General Practitioners (GPs) are family doctors. A GP is often the first doctor
people see about a health problem.

You can find a GP in your area using the [ HSE Service Finder Map
](https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/2/gp/) . Some GPs will also arrange
home visits.

GPs provide referrals to more specialised doctors called consultants. You
cannot see a consultant for the first time without a referral from a GP.

If you need to see a GP outside clinic hours, you can contact your local [ GP
out of hours service ](/en/health/health-services/gp-and-hospital-services/gp-
out-of-hours-service/) .
