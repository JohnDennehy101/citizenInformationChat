##  What are solar panels?

Solar panels are devices that use sunlight to generate hot water, or
electricity to power electrical devices in your home.

  * Solar panels that produce electricity are known as solar photovoltaic (PV) modules. These panels generate electricity when exposed to light. Solar PV is the rooftop solar you see on homes and businesses. 
  * [ Solar panels that produce hot water ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/solar-water-heating-grant/) are known as solar thermal collectors or solar hot water collectors. 

This Solar Electricity Grant focuses on PV, where solar electric panels
capture the light from the sun and convert it into the electricity that is
used in your home to power your TV, kettle, toaster and so on. These panels
are often mounted on the roof of your house or in the garden.

Most homes need six or seven solar panels, which is a 2 kilowatt system. It is
important that the system is sized for self-consumption of the energy within
the home as per the [ Code of Practice (pdf)
](https://www.seai.ie/publications/SPV-Code-of-Practice.pdf) .
