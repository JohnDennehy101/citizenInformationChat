###  Solar PV system requirements

Energy generated from your solar PV system should be used in your home, and
the system should be of a suitable size for this. See the [ Solar PV Grant
Application Guide (pdf) ](https://www.seai.ie/grants/home-energy-grants/solar-
electricity-grant/Solar-PV-Scheme-Guide.pdf) for further technical
specifications, as well as information on insurance, contracts, inspections,
grant limits and how to apply.

All systems must comply with the requirements set out in the [ Code of
Practice for Installers (pdf) ](https://www.seai.ie/publications/SPV-Code-of-
Practice.pdf) . The Declaration of Works must be completed and signed off by a
registered solar PV installer. Registered solar PV installers are listed on
seai.ie.
