###  **I don’t have access to the Internet**

If you don’t have internet access, you can continue to apply for social
welfare payments as normal. MyWelfare is just another way to access services,
apply for benefits, or amend your jobseeker’s details.

You can find information about how to apply for social welfare payments by
searching for the payment on our website.
