##  Residence and married couples or civil partners

For a married couple or civil partners, the residence status of each spouse is
assessed independently of the other. It is possible for one spouse or civil
partner to be resident and the other to be non-resident. . If you are resident
and your spouse is not, you are treated as single for tax purposes.

However, if you are resident and employed in Ireland but your spouse or civil
partner is not resident in Ireland and has no income - so that your earnings
are the only source of income - then it may be possible to claim the [ Married
or Civil Partner's Tax Credit ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/income-tax/taxation-of-
married-people/) and the [ increased tax rate band ](/en/money-and-
tax/tax/income-tax/how-your-tax-is-calculated/) . You can do this after the
end of the tax year when you file a return of income which includes a
declaration about your spouse or civil partner's income.
