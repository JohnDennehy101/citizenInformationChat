##  Choosing to be resident for tax purposes

If you arrive in Ireland in a particular year but do not have the required
number of days for tax purposes, you can still choose to be resident for that
year if you will be resident in the following year.

You must inform Revenue in writing if you choose to be tax resident in Ireland
in a tax year. [ Contact Revenue ](https://revenue.ie/en/contact-
us/Index.aspx) for details.
