###  **Where can I recycle WEEE?**

Companies that produce electrical and electronic goods must cover the cost of
collecting, treating, recovering and disposing of WEEE in an environmentally
friendly way.

This means you can return your household WEEE free of charge, either to a shop
when buying a replacement item, or to another authorised collection point,
such as a local authority civic amenity site.

WEEE Ireland have an [ interactive map ](https://www.weeeireland.ie/household-
recycling/where-can-i-recycle/) which can help you find the best place to go
to recycle your WEEE. Mywaste.ie also have a similar [ interactive map
](https://www.mywaste.ie/waste-service-locator/) which you can use.

WEEE should **not** be put in landfill sites because of the harmful substances
it contains.
