###  **Will electrical shops take back my WEEE?**

Retailers must take back your old electrical and electronic equipment in store
for free on a one-for-one, like-for-like basis. This means the old product
must be the same type or have the same purpose as the new item you are
purchasing.

Retailers in large stores (with an electrical-goods sales area greater than
400 square metres) must accept your small appliances (less than 25 cm high)
for recycling without insisting you buy anything.

You can return certain types of waste batteries at various shops for free, as
well as any local authority civic amenity site.
