##  What happens if I buy a drink in a restaurant or café?

Some restaurants and cafés may charge you a deposit fee if you buy a drink
that comes in a container.

Generally, sit-down restaurants and other businesses that focus on on-site
consumption will not charge you a deposit fee. This is because they can
collect and return the drink containers themselves.

Take-aways and other businesses that focus on off-site consumption, will
generally charge you a deposit fee. This is because you will usually take the
container away with you.
