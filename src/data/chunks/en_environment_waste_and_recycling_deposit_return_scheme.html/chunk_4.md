###  **What containers are not included in the recycling scheme?**

Some containers are not included in the scheme and canâ€™t be returned,
including:

  * Glass bottles or containers 
  * All dairy containers (for example, milk or yogurt containers) 
  * Containers over 3 litres 

You can not return drinks containers that were bought before 1 February 2024
as they do not have the Re-turn logo or barcode.

Since 1 June 2024, all containers included in the scheme should have a Re-turn
logo.

If your container doesn't have a Re-turn logo on it, you can't return it and
it should be recycled as normal.
