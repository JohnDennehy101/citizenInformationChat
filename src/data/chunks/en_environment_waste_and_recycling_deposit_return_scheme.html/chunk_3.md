##  What containers can be recycled?

Most drinks containers such as bottles, cans and tins made from plastic,
aluminium or steel can be returned once they are between 150ml and 3 litres in
size and have the Re-turn logo on them.

The containers should be empty, undamaged and in their original shape. The
container should have a [ Re-turn logo ](https://re-turn.ie) and the barcode
must also be readable.
