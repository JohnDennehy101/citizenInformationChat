###  **How do I collect my deposit?**

If you are using a Reverse Vending Machine, you will be given a voucher for
the value of the deposit on the number of containers you returned. You can
choose to use your voucher to buy something in that specific shop or to refund
your voucher for cash.

If you return your containers using an RVM, you can only use or get a refund
for your voucher in the same shop where you returned the bottles. You cannot
reclaim your voucher in a shop if you used a RVM in a different shop.
