###  Contact the business

As part of the online complaint form, you ask to talk with the business
directly.

The platform notifies the business of your request.

If the business is willing to talk, you will be able to exchange messages
directly through the ODR dashboard.

You have 90 days to reach an agreement through direct talks.

If the business has not engaged with the process within 30 days, the case will
be closed.
