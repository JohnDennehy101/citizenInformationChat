###  Use a dispute resolution body

If the business does not want to resolve the problem with you directly on the
platform, they can suggest a list of ADR bodies to use instead.

You have 30 days to agree on which body to use or your case will be closed.

If you agree to one of the ADR bodies suggested by the company, you confirm
this on the platform.

Your dispute will automatically be transferred to the ADR body for
consideration.

The ADR body will handle the complaint online and will have 90 days to make
their decision.

Either you or the business can withdraw from the process at any time.
