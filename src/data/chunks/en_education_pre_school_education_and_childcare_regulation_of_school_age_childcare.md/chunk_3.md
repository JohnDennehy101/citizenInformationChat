##  Registration of school age childcare services

School age childcare providers must be registered with Tusla. If a provider
offers services for school-age and pre-school children, they must be
registered to provide each service.

Any new service must register with Tusla 3 months before opening the school
age service. You can check the [ register of school age childcare services
