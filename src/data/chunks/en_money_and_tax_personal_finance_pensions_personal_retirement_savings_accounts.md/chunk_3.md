##  Who can get a PRSA?

Most people can get a PRSA but they can be especially useful if you have no
other pension arrangement. Employers that do not have an [ occupational
pension scheme ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/pensions/occupational-
pensions/) for their employees must provide access to at least one Standard
PRSA. Employees who are not entitled to join a pension scheme within 6 months
of service must be given access to a PRSA by their employer. [ Read more about
