###  Investment of your money

Standard PRSAs invest only in pooled funds where the risk is spread across a
large number and variety of investments. Non-Standard PRSAs can offer wider
investment choices. However, you need to be sure that you understand the
investment choices and the reasons why you should choose them. If you do not
understand how your pension will be invested, then you should consider if this
product is best for you.

You should also be sure that you can afford the monthly payment suggested and
that this is the most effective payment for [ tax relief ](/en/money-and-
tax/personal-finance/pensions/tax-relief-on-pensions/) .

You should get a report on investment performance every 6 months.

You should get a statement of reasonable projection every year showing the
estimated benefits at retirement you could expect, based on certain
assumptions.
