###  Evidence collected in breach of non-constitutional law

In some situations, evidence may be obtained in breach of legislation or other
laws but not in breach of the Constitution. This category of evidence is often
called illegally-obtained evidence.

For example, the Constitution does not give the same protection to a business
premises as it does to a home. Nonetheless, the power to search such premises
often has be given by legislation and any search must be conducted in
accordance with that legislation.

If a search is conducted on a business premises not in accordance with the
relevant legislation, any evidence gathered is not automatically inadmissible
in court. It is up to the judge to decide whether to allow the evidence after
considering all the surrounding circumstances.
