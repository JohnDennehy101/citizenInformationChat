##  Introduction

The [ Irish Constitution ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-introduction/) guarantees the people of Ireland
certain [ fundamental rights ](/en/government-in-ireland/irish-
constitution-1/constitution-fundamental-rights/) . Sometimes, the Garda√≠ or
the prosecution in a case can get evidence for a trial in breach of your
fundamental rights. This means that they got the evidence in circumstances
where your constitutional rights have not been respected.
