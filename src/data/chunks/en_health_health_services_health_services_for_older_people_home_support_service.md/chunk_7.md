###  How does the Home Support Service work?

The supports are provided by the HSE, or else by an external provider that is
approved by the HSE.

If you are approved for the service and HSE staff are not available, an
external [ provider approved by the HSE ](https://www.hse.ie/eng/home-support-
services/choosing-an-approved-provider/) will deliver the home support to you.
The HSE can arrange this service on your behalf. You deal directly with the
approved provider of your choice to arrange the days and times for the
support.

Alternatively, you can request to deal directly with an approved provider. If
you are approved, the HSE will write to you to tell you the weekly amount of
funding you can use to arrange home support from your chosen provider. This
approach is called Consumer Directed Home Support (CDHS). The number of hours
of home support that the funding provides depends on the rates charged by the
provider. The provider will tell you what rates they have agreed with the HSE.

You can request Consumer Directed Home Support when you apply. Whether your
services are CDHS or are arranged by the HSE, you can choose to change to the
other approach if you wish.
