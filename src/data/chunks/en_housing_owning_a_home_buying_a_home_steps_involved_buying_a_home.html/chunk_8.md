###  Get mortgage approval

Very few people can buy a home without getting a [ mortgage
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/help-with-buying-a-home/taking-out-a-mortgage/) .
A mortgage is a long-term loan secured against the property you buy. This
means if you don’t repay your mortgage, you may lose your home.

There are different types of mortgages and different mortgage providers.
Contact several different mortgage providers to find out who can offer you the
best deal. More information on mortgages and choosing the best one for you is
available from the [ Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC)
](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/mortgages/) . The CCPC has a [ mortgage
calculator ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/tools-and-calculators/mortgage-
calculators/mortgage-calculator/) that shows what your monthly repayments will
be depending on the amount you borrow, how long the mortgage will last and the
interest rate.

You can get mortgage approval in principle before you start to look for a
property. This lets you know how much you have to spend. However, when you
find a property you like, you must get formal mortgage approval before you
sign the contract for sale (see below). If you sign a contract for sale and
then don’t get mortgage approval, you will lose your deposit and there may be
other penalties.
