###  Public auction

Auctions are usually advertised in a local newspaper, estate agent or by a
sign on the property. Generally, the seller or the auctioneer will set a
reserve figure for the property. The reserve figure is the value the property
must reach at auction. If the property does not reach the reserve figure it
will be withdrawn from the market.

The seller can also withdraw the property from the market at any time during
the auction, even if it has achieved the reserve figure. The seller can also
sell the property before the auction.

Before the auction takes place, your solicitor should check the contract for
sale for the property (issued by the seller's solicitor) and all title
documents that are referred to in that contract. When your solicitor has
satisfied their enquiries, you can organise a survey of the property to ensure
it is sound. You should also get formal mortgage approval for the property you
want to bid on.

The successful bidder immediately pays a deposit and signs the contract for
sale (see below). It is important to get home insurance as soon as possible.
