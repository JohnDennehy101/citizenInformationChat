###  Private treaty sale

A private treaty sale is where the property is not put into an auction. You
can contact the seller or the sellerâ€™s agent, usually an estate agent, to
agree a purchase price.

If there is an estate agent involved, once you have agreed to buy the property
you may need to pay a booking deposit to the estate agent. The legal process
to buy the property may only start when the estate agent receives your booking
deposit. This deposit is refundable up to the signing of the contract for sale
(see below).

Your mortgage provider will give you formal mortgage approval and issue you
with a loan pack. You will need to think about [ mortgage protection insurance
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-home/insurance-protection-on-mortgages/)
and [ home insurance ](https://www.ccpc.ie/consumers/money/insurance/home-
insurance/) . You can organise these with your mortgage provider but it is
advisable to shop around. When your solicitor has checked the contract for
sale, you will sign it and pay a deposit (less any booking fee).
