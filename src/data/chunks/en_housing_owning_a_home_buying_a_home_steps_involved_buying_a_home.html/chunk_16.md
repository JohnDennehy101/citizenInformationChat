###  Stamp duty  

Your solicitor will calculate how much [ stamp duty ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/buying-a-home/stamp-duty/) is due on the property and request this amount
from you before the sale is closed. The stamp duty is paid to the [ Revenue
Commissioners ](http://www.revenue.ie/) , who place a stamp on the deeds.
Without this stamp, the deeds cannot be registered. The deeds name the owner
of the property.
