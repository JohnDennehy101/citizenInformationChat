##  Signing the contract for sale

The _contract for sale_ binds the parties to the completion of the sale. If
you withdraw from the sale after this contract has been signed, you may lose
your deposit. If you buy at auction you must immediately sign the contract for
sale. If you buy through private treaty your solicitor will check that the
contract is in order before you sign it. The completion date will be set out
in the contract and the balance of the agreed purchase price will be due on
that date.
