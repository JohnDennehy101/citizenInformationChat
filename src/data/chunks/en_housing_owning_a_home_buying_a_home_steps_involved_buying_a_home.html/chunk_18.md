###  Deeds  

Once a sale is completed, your [ deeds ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-
home/property-deeds/) , showing the new ownership details must be registered
with either the Registry of Deeds or the Land Registry. [ Tailte Éireann
](https://www.tailte.ie/registration/) is responsible for both systems of
registration.

Your solicitor will help you to finalise the deeds to your house with Tailte
Éireann. This can take months or years to complete. Even if this does take a
long time, you are still the owner of the property and, if you want, you can
sell the property before registration is complete.
