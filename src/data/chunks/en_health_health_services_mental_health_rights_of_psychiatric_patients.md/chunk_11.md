###  Consent to psychiatric treatment

In general, medical and surgical treatment may be administered only with the
informed consent of the patient. The law is different in the case of
psychiatric patients.

For the purposes of the Mental Health Act 2001, consent means consent in
writing, obtained freely without threats or inducements, where:

  * The consultant psychiatrist who is caring for you certifies that you are capable of understanding the nature, purpose and likely effects of the proposed treatment and 
  * The psychiatrist has given you adequate information, in a form and a language that you can understand, on the nature, purpose and likely effects of the proposed treatment. 

Under the Act, your consent to treatment is required except where the
consultant psychiatrist considers that the treatment is necessary to safeguard
your life, to restore your health, to alleviate your condition or to relieve
your suffering, and you are incapable of giving such consent because of your
mental disorder.

Psycho-surgery may not be performed unless you consent and it is authorised by
a mental health tribunal. Psycho-surgery will not be carried out while
temporary measures for mental health tribunals (above) are in place to deal
with coronavirus.

Electro-convulsive therapy may not be performed unless you give consent or
where you are unable to give consent and the therapy is authorised by the
consultant psychiatrist responsible for you and by another consultant
psychiatrist.

If you have been on medication for 3 months, your consultant must ask for you
to consent to continue taking it. If you do not consent and your consultant
believes you fully understand your decision, you do not have to take the
medicine. If the consultant believes you do not understand the decision and a
second consultant psychiatrist agrees, you can be given the medication for up
to 3 months. Your medication will be reviewed in the same way every 3 months.
