###  Civil proceedings generally

There are certain restrictions on taking civil actions in court arising from
actions taken under the Mental Health Act. You need to get the permission of
the High Court before taking civil proceedings in respect of any act done in
carrying out the functions of the Mental Health Act. The High Court must not
refuse such permission unless it is satisfied that the proceedings are either
frivolous or vexatious or that there are no reasonable grounds for contending
that the person against whom the proceedings are brought acted in bad faith or
without reasonable care. The court is not allowed to determine the proceedings
in favour of the patient unless it is satisfied that the person against whom
the proceedings are brought acted in bad faith or without reasonable care.
