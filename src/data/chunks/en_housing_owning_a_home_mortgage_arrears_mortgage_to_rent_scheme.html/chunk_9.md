###  Purchase price of your home

Before your home can be sold to a housing association or private company, it
must be valued independently and the lender and the housing association must
agree a price. The price will be based on several factors, including the
market valuation of the property and the cost of any necessary repairs. If the
lender and the housing association or private company cannot agree a price,
the arrangement will not go ahead.
