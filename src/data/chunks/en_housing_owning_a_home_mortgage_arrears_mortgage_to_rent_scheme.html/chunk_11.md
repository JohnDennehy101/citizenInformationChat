###  Housing associations and approved private companies

Under the mortgage-to-rent scheme, your home can be bought by a housing
association or an approved private company. If a housing association buys your
home, they will own it and be your landlord. But, if an approved private
company buys your home, the private company will own your home, but your local
authority will be your landlord.

However, with both options you will be a social housing tenant and your rent
will be set at an affordable rate by the local authority. For more details on
the differences between these options, see [ mortgagetorent.ie
