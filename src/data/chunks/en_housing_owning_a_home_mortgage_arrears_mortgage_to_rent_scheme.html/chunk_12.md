###  Appeals

If your lender does not agree that you are suitable for the mortgage-to-rent
scheme, they must tell you why in writing. You can appeal to the lender’s
Appeals Committee under the [ Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP)
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-arrears/mortgage-arrears-resolution-
process/) .

If the local authority decides that you are not eligible for social housing
support (which means that you cannot access the mortgage-to-rent scheme), you
can appeal this decision through the local authority’s internal appeals
system. If you are not happy with the outcome, you can contact the [ Ombudsman
](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-works/standards-and-
accountability/office-of-the-ombudsman/) .
