##  What is the mortgage-to-rent scheme?

If you are having trouble paying your mortgage, the [ mortgage-to-rent
](https://mortgagetorent.ie/) scheme lets you switch from owning your home to
renting it as a social housing tenant. Under the scheme, you choose to give up
ownership of your home to your lender. This means you will no longer own your
home or have any financial interest in it.

An [ approved housing body (AHB) ](/en/housing/local-authority-and-social-
housing/approved-housing-bodies/) or approved private company then buys your
home from your lender and rents it back to you. You become a social housing
tenant, which means you pay an affordable rent based on your income. If your
income increases the rent increases. If your income falls the rent decreases.

Under the scheme, you become a social housing tenant with a right to have your
housing needs met by the local authority indefinitely. This means that if your
needs change, the local authority will provide alternative accommodation that
meets your changed needs. If your financial situation improves, you have an
option to buy your home back.
