###  Capital and property not personally used

Savings, investments, cash on hand and any property you own (but not your own
home) is assessed as capital. All your capital from different sources is added
together and a special formula is then used to find your weekly means from
capital.

The property and investments that may be assessed under this heading include
savings in a bank account (or anywhere else), a house that you have let, and
stocks and shares. You may or may not be getting an income from the property
or investment. Income from property already assessed on its capital value is
not assessed in the means test - see 'Cash income' above.
