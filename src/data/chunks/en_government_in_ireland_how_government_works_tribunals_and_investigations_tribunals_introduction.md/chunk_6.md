##  Non-statutory inquiries

When an inquiry is set up through an Act of the Oireachtas, it is called a
statutory inquiry. Tribunals of inquiry and commissions of investigation are
forms of statutory inquiry.

Not all inquiries are set up on a statutory basis. A Minister may commission
an inquiry into a matter of public importance. Some examples are:

  * In 2000 the Minister for Health and Children established an inquiry into the retention of human organs without permission 
  * In 2012 the Minister for Health and Children commissioned a [ report on the practice of symphysiotomy ](http://health.gov.ie/blog/publications/report-on-symphysiotomy-in-ireland-1944-1984-professor-oonagh-walsh/) in Ireland. 

Sometimes a preliminary inquiry may be held in order to make the work of the
main inquiry easier. The [ Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse
](http://www.childabusecommission.ie/about/index.html) was initially
established on an administrative basis in 1999 before being established on a
statutory basis in 2000 under the [ Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act
2000 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0007/index.html) .

Further information on inquiries and investigations is available in the Law
