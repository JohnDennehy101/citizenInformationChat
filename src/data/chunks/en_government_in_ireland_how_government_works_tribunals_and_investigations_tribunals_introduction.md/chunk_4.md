##  Parliamentary inquiries

The Oireachtas can nominate members to [ form a committee
](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/committees/about-committees/) to examine
policy, legislation, or a particular topic. The committee can seek submissions
from experts and interested parties, and must report its findings back to the
Oireachtas. The committee uses an investigative process to reach conclusions
before making its report. Some committees (for example, the Committee of
Public Accounts) are standing committees. This means that they are established
after every general election.
