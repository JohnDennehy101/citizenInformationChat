##  Tribunals of inquiry and commissions of investigation

[ Tribunals of inquiry ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/tribunals-and-investigations/tribunals-of-inquiry/) are set up with
powers to investigate specific matters. They are usually chaired by judges or
senior lawyers. At the end of the investigation, the tribunal submits a report
to the Oireachtas, which may contain recommendations.

The Oireachtas has the power to establish a tribunal of inquiry to investigate
matters of public importance. The tribunal's function is purely fact-finding
and investigative. Although it may make recommendations, it does not make a
binding judgement on the rights or liabilities of individuals. It simply
states, in its report, the results of its investigations and the findings of
fact it has made.

A [ commission of investigation ](/en/government-in-ireland/how-government-
works/tribunals-and-investigations/commissions-of-investigation/) is a less
expensive and speedier method of investigating matters of significant public
concern. It is set up by government order which must be approved by the DÃ¡il
and Seanad. The terms of reference are set by the Government or by an
individual Minister. Evidence is usually given to the Commission in private.
The commission makes a final report on its findings to a specified Minister.
