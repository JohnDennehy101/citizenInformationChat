##  Redress

On some occasions, following an investigation, a scheme has been set up to
compensate the victims of the episode or conduct which was under investigation
at the inquiry. The following are examples of such compensation schemes:

  * The [ Hepatitis Compensation Tribunal ](http://www.hepccomptrib.com/) was set up in 1995. It provides compensation to those infected with Hepatitis C or HIV as a result of the use of Human Immunoglobulin Anti-D or as a result of the receipt of a blood transfusion or blood product within the State. 
  * The [ Residential Institutions Redress Board ](http://www.rirb.ie/) was established in 2002. It was set up to compensate those who, as children, were abused while resident in industrial schools, reformatories and other institutions subject to State regulation or inspection. 
  * [ Caranua ](http://www.caranua.ie/) was established in 2013 under the [ Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012 ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/act/pub/0035/index.html) to help those who experienced abuse in residential institutions and have received settlements through the Residential Institutions Redress Board or the courts. 
  * The [ Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/544fc6-the-surgical-symphysiotomy-ex-gratia-payment-scheme-report/) was set up in 2014 to provide ex-gratia payments to women who underwent a surgical symphysiotomy or a pubiotomy in any hospital in the State between 1940 and 1990.
