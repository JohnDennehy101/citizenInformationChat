##  Restrictions on disposal of the vehicle

"Disposal" means the sale of the vehicle, the gift of the vehicle to another
person and the hiring or renting of the vehicle. The vehicle must not be
disposed of for at least 2 years from the date the relief is granted. You must
keep the vehicle for 3 years for a specifically adapted vehicle and 6 years
for an extensively adapted vehicle or a wheelchair accessible adapted vehicle.

You will only be allowed to dispose of the vehicle within the retention period
if you refund the Revenue Commissioners a substantial portion of the relief
given. This is calculated by looking at the value of the vehicle at the time
of disposal.

If the vehicle is disposed of following damage in an accident, the damage will
be taken into account in calculating the value of the vehicle at the time of
disposal.
