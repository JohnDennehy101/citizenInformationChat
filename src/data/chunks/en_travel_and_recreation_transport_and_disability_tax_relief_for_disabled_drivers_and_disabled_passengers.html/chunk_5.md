##  The type of vehicle

If you are a driver or a passenger with a disability you can claim tax relief
on:

  * A new vehicle 
  * A used vehicle that has not been previously registered in the State 

You can also buy a previously registered used vehicle; in which case the
amount of the repayment will be the residual VAT contained in the value of the
vehicle. However, the majority of used vehicles purchased from a dealer are
purchased under the [ Margin Scheme ](https://www.revenue.ie/en/vat/vat-on-
goods/schemes/margin-scheme/index.aspx) . This means that no VAT is due when
the vehicle is bought and therefore no VAT is refundable.

If you bought the vehicle before you qualified as a disabled driver or
disabled passenger, a repayment of VAT and VRT, appropriate to the market
value of the vehicle at the time of entry into the scheme, will be made.

If you are a passenger with disabilities and you buy a used vehicle that has
previously qualified for tax relief under the scheme for transporting disabled
passengers and where the original adaptions remain in place when you buy it,
it is eligible for the scheme.

To qualify for the tax relief the vehicleâ€™s engine must be less than 6,000cc.
