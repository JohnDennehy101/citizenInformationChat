##  Residency requirements

A family member of a disabled passenger can also qualify for relief if they
are living with and responsible for the transport of the disabled person in
question and got the vehicle for that purpose.

If you only stay with a family member on a part-time basis, the residency
requirement is not met. However, if you are a minor who is in residential or
medical care on a part-time or occasional basis and spend a significant part
of your time at home, for example, every weekend and holidays, the residency
requirement may be met. The Revenue Commissioners can waive the residency
requirement in certain circumstances. In particular, it will normally be
waived where the applicant acts as a carer and is responsible for the
transport of the family member with the disability.

You should contact the Central Repayments Office to make sure that you meet
the residency requirements for relief under the scheme before buying a
vehicle.
