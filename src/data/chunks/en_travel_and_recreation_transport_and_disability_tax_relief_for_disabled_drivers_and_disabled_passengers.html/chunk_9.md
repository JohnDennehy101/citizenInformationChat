###  Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme

The maximum amount of VRT and VAT relief available under the Disabled Drivers
and Disabled Passengers Scheme depends on whether you are a disabled driver or
passenger and how the car has been adapted.

The maximum amounts are:

  * Disabled drivers: €10,000 
  * Disabled passengers: €16,000 
  * Specifically adapted vehicles for drivers with severe disabilities: €16,000 (Specifically adapted vehicles are vehicles that need significant adaptations) 
  * Extensively adapted vehicles for drivers and passengers: €22,000 (Extensively adapted vehicles are vehicles that need adaptations that cost more than the open market selling price of the vehicle being adapted) 
  * Wheelchair accessible adaptations: €48,000 for a disabled driver and €32,000 for a disabled passenger. This is for people with disabilities who need complex and significant adaptions to their vehicles to allow in-vehicle wheelchair access. It applies to people who have paid VAT, VRT or residual VRT on or after 1 August 2022.
