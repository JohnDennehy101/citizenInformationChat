###  Applying for a toll road exemption

Vehicles adapted for disabled drivers or passengers are entitled to an
**exemption from toll-fees** .

The [ Disability Toll Exemption Scheme (DTES) ](https://dtes.ie/dtes-scheme/)
allows drivers of qualifying vehicles to travel toll free on all Irish roads
using their DTES disc. Only one application is needed under this scheme.

To qualify, your vehicle must be eligible for tax relief under the Drivers and
Passengers with Disabilities Scheme.

You can apply for a DTES disc and read more information about the rules of the
scheme on [ dtes.ie ](https://dtes.ie/dtes-scheme/) .

If your vehicle is adapted and qualifies for tax relief, but you have not
applied for a DTES disc, you can still travel toll-free by going to the manned
tollbooth and showing your tax disc.
