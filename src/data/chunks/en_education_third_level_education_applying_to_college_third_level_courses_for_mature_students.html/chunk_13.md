##  Applying for college as a mature student

If you are applying for a course in a higher education institution, you should
first contact the college directly about their application requirements.

The Admissions Office or Mature Students Officer will have information about
any specific requirements or extra information you need to provide when
applying for your course.

You will be in competition with other mature students for a place on the
course, so make sure to include as much detail as possible regarding your
educational background, work experience and other interests.
