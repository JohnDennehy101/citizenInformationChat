####  **Distance learning, online courses and hybrid courses**

Traditional distance learning takes place away from a physical classroom.
There is no tutor and you learn at your own pace. An example of traditional
distance learning is a correspondence course, where you receive the course
materials by post and study in your own time.

Online courses and learning platforms are different. Some courses can be
accessed without a tutor at any time (for example, LinkedIn Learning courses).
Others follow the traditional model of a tutor holding classes and modules
online that you can attend remotely from home or elsewhere.

Some distance learning and online courses have a blended option, sometimes
called a hybrid course, where you can choose to attend in person or remotely.
A hybrid course usually requires some in-person attendance. Students may also
come together to study for a day, a weekend, or a week at a time depending on
the course requirements.

The terms distance learning and online, blended and hybrid can be used by
colleges interchangeably, so be sure to check with your chosen college to find
out exactly how they run their courses.
