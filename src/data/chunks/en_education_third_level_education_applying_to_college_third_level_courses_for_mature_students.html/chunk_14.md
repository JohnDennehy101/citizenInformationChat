###  **Applying through the CAO as a mature student**

They will tell you if you need to submit an application directly to the
institution or use the [ CAO application process
](https://www.cao.ie/index.php?page=mature) , or both.

If the institution wants you to apply through the CAO and you wish to be
assessed as a mature student, you must register on the CAO system before 1
February of the year you plan to start your course. If you apply before 20
January there is a discounted application fee of €30. The normal fee €45.

Most higher education institutions will not consider your mature student
application if you apply using the ‘Late Application’ or ‘Change of Mind’
facilities on the CAO portal.

The CAO has detailed information on [ applying to college as a mature student
