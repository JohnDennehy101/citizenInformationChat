###  **Full-time study**

Third-level colleges reserve a small number of places for mature students who
want to do a full-time course.

This means that you will compete for your place on a different basis to those
who are just leaving school. The number of places reserved for mature students
is limited.

If you choose a full-time course, you will be expected to attend classes or
lectures every day and you will be assessed in the same way as the other
students on your course.

Many colleges and universities hold information events for people who want to
study as mature students. The Qualifax website has a calendar of [ career
events ](https://www.qualifax.ie/events) that take place during the year.
