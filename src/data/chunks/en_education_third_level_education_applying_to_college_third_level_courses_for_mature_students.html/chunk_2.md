##  What is a mature student?

You are normally a mature student if you are:

  * At least 23 years of age on 1 January the year you start your course, and 
  * You are starting college for the first time 

Sometimes, if you started but didn’t finish your course, you can still be
considered a mature student if you are aged 23 or over. However, you won’t get
a student grant unless you have completed a full break in studies of at least
5 years. You should contact the Admissions Office in [ the college where you
want to study ](https://www.iua.ie/ourwork/access/mature-students/) for
information about entering as a mature student because different colleges have
different requirements and entry routes.

Depending on your course and circumstances, as a mature student you may
qualify for a student grant or help with fees (see ‘University access
programmes’ and ‘Fees for mature students’ below).
