####  **Modular programmes**

A [ modular programme ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/5eaf0-modular-courses/)
is made up of separate modules (self-contained units within a course). You can
study and complete each module separately at different stages during that
course.

Modular programmes can take place in a classroom setting or in a blended or
online setting. Modular courses are available at degree level in some
universities.
