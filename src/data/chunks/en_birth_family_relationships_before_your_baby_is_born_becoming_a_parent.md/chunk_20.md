**Extra supports for parents**

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has

](https://www2.hse.ie/babies-children/parenting-advice/services-
supports/extra-support/) .

Your GP will be able to refer you to supports and services if necessary. Your
public health nurse (PHN) can also help. They can refer you to other sources
of support in your local area, for example, local parenting groups or [ Family
Resource Centres ](https://www.tusla.ie/services/family-community-
support/family-resource-centres/) .

agency/) may put you in touch with a social worker if your family needs
additional support. Social workers and family support workers work closely

develop a plan to meet those needs.
