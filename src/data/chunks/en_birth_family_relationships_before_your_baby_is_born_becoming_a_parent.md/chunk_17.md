##  Registration of birth

[ You should register the birth of your child ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/after-your-baby-is-born/registering-birth-your-baby/) within 3
months of the date of their birth. However, you have up to 12 months to
register the birth. [ You can also register a stillbirth ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/miscarriage-and-stillbirth/registering-stillbirth/) . You can
register a birth or a stillbirth in any [ HSE Civil Registration Service
](https://www2.hse.ie/services/births-deaths-and-marriages/find-a-civil-
registration-service/) .

The law in Ireland makes [ presumptions about the paternity ](/en/birth-
family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/presumption-of-paternity/) of
children born to married couples. This means the husband is presumed by law to
be the father of the child and he has automatic guardianship of that child
unless the mother states otherwise. However, the presumption that a womanâ€™s
husband is the father of the child no longer applies if the child is born more
than 10 months after the couple [ separated ](/en/birth-family-
relationships/separation-and-divorce/factors-in-separation-divorce/) .

A father that is not married to the mother of their child is not an automatic
guardian of their own children and they do not have an automatic right to have
their name included on their child's birth certificate. Read more about the [
