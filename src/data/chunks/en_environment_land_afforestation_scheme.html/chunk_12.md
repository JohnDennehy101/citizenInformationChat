###  Making submissions or observations on an afforestation application

Anyone can make a submission or observation on an afforestation application.
You must make a submission about the application within 30 days of the notice
being published on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine’s
website.

If the Department receives a Natura Impact Statement (NIS) or if they complete
an Appropriate Assessment Report, there will be a second 30-day consultation
period.

The fee for making a submission is €20. This fee is non-refundable, regardless
of the final decision on the licence application.

You must make your submission or request for more information in writing. Your
submission must include your:

  * Name 
  * Address 
  * Email or phone number 

You can upload your submission to the Forestry Licence Viewer. After you
upload your submission, it will be available for others to view, along with
your name and address.

You can also make your submission by email or post.

  * **Post** : Approvals Section, Forestry Division, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Johnstown Castle Estate, Co. Wexford 
  * **Email** : forestrysubmission@agriculture.gov.ie 

Your submission must be received by the Department before 4pm on the date on
the notice, or it won’t be accepted.
