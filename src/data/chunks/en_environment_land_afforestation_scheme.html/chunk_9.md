###  Appropriate Assessment Pre-Screening Report

An Appropriate Assessment Pre-Screening Report lets you and your registered
forester know if your planned forest is going to impact a [ Special Protection
Area (SPA) ](https://www.npws.ie/protected-sites/sac) or a [ Special Area of
Conservation (SAC) ](https://www.npws.ie/protected-sites/sac) , which may
affect if your planned forest is approved.

If the report shows that your planned forest wonâ€™t have an impact on these
areas, you can submit this report as part of your application.

If it shows that the forest will have an impact on these areas, you can submit
a [ Natura Impact Statement (NIS) ](https://www.npws.ie/protected-
sites/guidance-appropriate-assessment-planning-authorities) along with your
application and your Appropriate Assessment Pre-Screening Report, outlining
how you plan to avoid causing a negative impact on the areas.
