##  How much do I get?

The amount of money you get depends on the type of forest you plant.

The grant is split into 2 separate main payments.

You claim the first payment after you’ve planted the trees to cover this cost.
This payment is worth 75% of the overall grant.

You claim your second payment 4 years after planting after you have
successfully established your forest. This is 25% of the overall grant.

You also get yearly premiums. The value and number of premiums you get depends
on the type of forest you plant and if you are a farmer.
