###  Environmental reports and assessments

**Environmental process for areas of 50 hectares or more**

If your planned forest is on 50 hectares of land or more, you need to submit
an [ Environmental Impact Statement (EIS
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/407/made/en/print#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%E2%80%98EIS%E2%80%99%20means%20%E2%80%9Ca%20report%20prepared%20by%20competent%20experts%2C%20submitted%20by%20the%20applicant%20that%20complies%20with%20the%20requirements%20of%20Article%205.1%20of%20the%20EIA%20Directive%20and%20is%20referred%20to%20in%20the%20EIA%20Directive%20as%20the%20environmental%20impact%20assessment%20report%3B%E2%80%9D%2C)
) with your application for technical approval for the Afforestation Scheme.

The EIS should outline any environmental impact that might be caused by your
proposed planting and the steps you plan to take to minimise these.

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will then do an [
Environmental Impact Assessment
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/climate-
change/environmental-impact-assessment/#l1c975) as part of your application
process.

**Environmental process for areas of less than 50 hectares**

If your planned forest is less than 50 hectares, there is an environmental
impact assessment screening process at the pre-approval stage when you apply
for your afforestation licence.

This determines if your project may have a significant effect on the local
environment. This is done by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the
Marine.

If the Department decides that your planned planting area could have a large
environmental impact, you must submit an Environmental Impact Statement so the
Department to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment.
