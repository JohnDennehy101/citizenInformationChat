###  How do I get paid?

Parent's Benefit is paid directly into your bank or building society account
(a current or deposit account, not a mortgage account) or you can choose to
have it paid directly into your employer's bank account.

If your employer pays you in full while you are on parent’s leave, they may
require Parent’s Benefit to be paid directly into their bank account. You
should check your contract of employment to see what applies to you
