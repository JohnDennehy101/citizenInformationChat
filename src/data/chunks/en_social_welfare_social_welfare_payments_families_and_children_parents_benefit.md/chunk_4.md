###  PRSI contributions for Parent's Benefit

You must have a certain number of paid PRSI contributions on your social
insurance record. Your PRSI contributions can be from both employment and
self-employment. You must meet the conditions when you apply.

You get [ credited contributions or credits ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-
welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/credited-social-insurance-contributions/)
automatically when you are getting Parent’s Benefit.

Time spent on the [ COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (CPUP)
](/en/social-welfare/unemployed-people/covid19-pandemic-unemployment-payment/)
and the [ COVID-19 Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS)
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/employment-wage-subsidy-scheme/)
will be treated as if you are continuing to make insurance contributions at
your normal social insurance class.

The PRSI classes that count for Parent’s Benefit are A, B, C, D, E, H and S
(self-employed).

You must have:

  * 39 weeks PRSI paid in the 12-month period before the first day of your Parent’s Benefit 

Or

  * 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and at least 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year or in the year immediately following the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on parent’s leave in 2024, the relevant tax year is 2022 and the tax year immediately following the relevant tax year is 2023. 

Or

  * 26 weeks PRSI paid in the relevant tax year and at least 26 weeks PRSI paid in the tax year before the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on parent’s leave in 2024, the relevant tax year is 2022 and the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year is 2021. 

If you were in insurable self-employment before starting insurable employment
(as an employee), your PRSI contributions (Class S) may help you qualify for
Parent’s Benefit if you do not satisfy the employee PRSI conditions as stated
above.

If you are self-employed, you must have:

  * 52 PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the relevant tax year 

Or

  * 52 PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on adoptive leave in 2024, the tax year immediately before the relevant tax year is 2021. 

Or

  * 52 qualifying PRSI contributions paid at Class S in the tax year immediately following relevant tax year. For example, if you are going on adoptive leave in 2024, the tax year immediately following the relevant tax year is 2023. 

If you are now self-employed but you were in insurable employment before you
became self-employed, your PRSI contributions (Class A, E and H) in that
employment may help you qualify for Parent’s Benefit if you do not satisfy the
self-employment conditions as stated above.

The relevant tax year is the second last complete tax year before the Benefit
year in which your adoptive leave starts. The Benefit year begins on the first
Monday in January in each calendar year and ends on the Sunday immediately
before the first Monday in the next calendar year. For example, the relevant
tax year is 2022 for claims made in 2024.
