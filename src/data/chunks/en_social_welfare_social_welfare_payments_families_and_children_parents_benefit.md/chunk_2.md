##  What is Parent's Benefit?

Parent’s Benefit and parent’s leave are for parents in the first 2 years after
their child’s birth or adoption.

Parent’s Benefit is paid while you are on [ parent’s leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/parents-
leave/) from work if you have enough [ social insurance (PRSI) contributions.
](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/social-insurance-prsi/social-
insurance/)

Each parent can get parent’s leave and Parent’s Benefit.

You must be on [ parent’s leave
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-
conditions/leave-and-holidays/parents-leave/) to get Parent’s Benefit.
However, it is possible to qualify for parent’s leave and not get Parent’s
Benefit if you don’t meet the PRSI contribution conditions.

From 1 August 2024, Parent’s Benefit is extended from 7 weeks to 9 weeks, if
you are the parent of:

  * A child born or adopted on or after 1 August 2024 
  * A child under 2 years of age on 1 August 2024 or an adopted child placed with your family less than 2 years on 1 August 2024 - you must complete the extra parent's leave on or before your child’s second birthday or within 2 years of the adoption placement 

You can take your leave in separate weeks or all at once.

Parent’s Benefit is only paid once for both single and multiple births. For
example, if you have twins or adopt 2 children at the same time, you get one
payment.

If you are already getting a social welfare payment, then you may get half-
rate Parent’s Benefit.
