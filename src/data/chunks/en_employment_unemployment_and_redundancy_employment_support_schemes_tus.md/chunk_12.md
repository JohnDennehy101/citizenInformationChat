##  Community and voluntary organisations

The work placements are proposed and provided by community and voluntary
organisations. The organisations must provide good quality work opportunities
that are of benefit to the community.

Organisations with a proposed work placement should register with the local
development company or Údarás na Gaeltachta in their area. They will be asked
to submit a proposal detailing the work and the number of participants
requested. The local development company or Údarás na Gaeltachta will assess
and make a decision on the proposal.
