###  Allocation of places

The places on the scheme are allocated to community and voluntary
organisations involved in the delivery of local services in urban and rural
areas – see 'Community and voluntary organisations' below. The allocation is
based on the number of eligible unemployed people in each local development
company or Údarás na Gaeltachta area.
