###  Selection process

Most unemployed people who are eligible for the scheme will be identified and
contacted by their Intreo Centre or local Social Welfare Branch Office and
offered a place in the scheme. Potential participants can also sign themselves
up to the scheme.

If you agree to participate in the Tús scheme you will be referred to your
local development company or Údarás na Gaeltachta where you will be recruited
for a suitable placement when it becomes available.

As there are only limited places available on the scheme, not all eligible
unemployed people will be contacted.
