###  Tax and PRSI

The Tús payment is taxable but the amount payable depends on individual
circumstances.

Class A PRSI contributions will be paid for all participants. Those earning
more than €352 a week will pay a PRSI contribution.

Participants in the Tús scheme are exempt from the Universal Social Charge.
