##  How much Illness Benefit will I get?

Your weekly rate of Illness Benefit (IB) will depend on your **average weekly
earnings** in the relevant tax year.

Average weekly earnings are your gross earnings (without deductions) in the
relevant tax year divided by the actual number of weeks you worked in that
year. If your Illness Benefit claim begins in 2024, the relevant tax year is
2022.

If you had no earnings from work but got PUP in 2021, you will meet the
average weekly earnings requirement and get the maximum rate of Illness
Benefit. However, if you had earnings from work in 2021, your average weekly
earnings will be calculated by dividing your gross yearly earnings by the
number of paid contributions.

Usually, no payment is made for the first 3 days of illness.
