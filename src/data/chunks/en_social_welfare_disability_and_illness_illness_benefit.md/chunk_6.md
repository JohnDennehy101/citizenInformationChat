##  How to qualify for Illness Benefit

To qualify for Illness Benefit, you must:

  * Be under pension age 
  * Be medically certified as unfit for work by a medical doctor (GP) 
  * Have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions – see below 
  * Apply within 6 weeks of becoming ill 

There is no payment for the first 3 days of illness. These are known as ‘
_waiting days_ ’ (Sunday is not counted as a waiting day.) There are no
waiting days if you were getting certain other social welfare payments within
3 days of the start of your illness.

**Pension age**

claim Illness Benefit. You will not get credited contributions while getting
Illness Benefit at age 66 or over.
