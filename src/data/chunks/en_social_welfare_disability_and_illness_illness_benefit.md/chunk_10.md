##  Work and Illness Benefit

You cannot work while you are getting Illness Benefit.

If you are getting Illness Benefit for at least 6 months, you can apply for [
Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) ](/en/social-welfare/disability-and-
illness/partial-capacity-benefit/) .

The PCB scheme allows you to return to work and continue to get a social
welfare payment, if you have a reduced capacity to work. A Medical Assessor (a
doctor employed by the Department of Social Protection) will assess the
restriction on your capacity for work.

The rate of PCB paid is based on this assessment.

You cannot start work until you have written approval from the DSP.

You must get written approval from the Illness Benefit section of the DSP
before you start any training or educational course or voluntary work.
