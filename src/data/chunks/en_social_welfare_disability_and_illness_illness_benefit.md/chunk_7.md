###  Social insurance (PRSI) contributions

To qualify for Illness Benefit, you must meet 2 social insurance (PRSI)
conditions:

You must have at least 104 weeks of PRSI contributions paid since you first
started work

**and**

39 weeks of PRSI contributions paid or credited in the relevant tax year, of
which 13 must be **paid** contributions. If you do not have 13 paid
contributions in the relevant tax year, then 13 paid contributions in one of
the following tax years can be used instead:

  * Either of the 2 tax years before the relevant tax year 
  * The last complete tax year (before the year in which your claim for Illness Benefit begins) 
  * The current tax year 

**or**

26 weeks of PRSI contributions paid in the relevant tax year **and** 26 weeks
of PRSI contributions paid in the tax year immediately before the relevant tax
year.

The relevant tax year is the second-last complete tax year before the year in
which your claim for Illness Benefit begins. For example, if your Illness
Benefit claim begins in 2024, the relevant tax year is 2022.

  * Only PRSI contributions paid at class A, E, H and P count towards Illness Benefit. 
  * If you were getting long-term Jobseeker's Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit immediately before applying for Illness Benefit, you do not need to have 13 paid contributions. 
  * If you were getting Occupational Injury Benefit (OIB) immediately before applying for Illness Benefit, you may use the tax year that applied to your OIB claim or the tax year that applies to your Illness Benefit claim, whichever is of greatest benefit to you. 

To help you qualify for Illness Benefit, you may use your Irish PRSI
contributions and your [ social insurance contributions from a country covered
by EU Regulations ](/en/social-welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-
social-welfare-payment/social-insurance-contributions-from-abroad/) or the
United Kingdom (UK). Your last social insurance contribution must be paid in
Ireland.
