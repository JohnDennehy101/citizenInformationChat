###  **Social assistance payments**

If you have no income or your income is low, you may qualify for a social
assistance payment.

When you apply for a social assistance payment, all your income is considered.
This is called a [ means test ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/means-test-for-social-welfare-
payments/means-test/) . How your income is considered in the means test
depends on the payment you apply for.

You must also meet the Habitual Residence Condition (HRC) to get a social
assistance payment. Find more information on the [ ‘Habitual Residence
Condition’ section ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-
ireland/applying-for-social-welfare/accessing-social-welfare-as-a-returning-
Irish-emigrant/#c25f40) above on this page.
