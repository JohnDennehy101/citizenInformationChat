##  Habitual Residence Condition

For certain social assistance payments, you need to show that Ireland is your
main place of residence. This is called the Habitual Residence Condition
(HRC). Some returning Irish immigrants can face difficulties with this
requirement.

The term “habitually resident” generally means that you:

  * Can prove close ties with Ireland 
  * Have been living in Ireland 
  * Plan to continue living here for the foreseeable future 

There are [ a range of materials you can provide as evidence
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/returning-to-ireland/applying-for-
social-welfare/habitual-residence-condition/#601334) to support your HRC
application. Along with these materials, you will need to complete the [ HRC1
form (pdf)
](https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/27484/305a54e8a062459ab0b394e8f2031ce9.pdf#page=null)
and send it to the relevant authority (for example, to the Child Benefit
Section in the Department of Social Protection).

The Department considers 5 factors when deciding if you are habitually
resident:

  1. How long you have lived in Ireland or any other country 
  2. The reason you lived abroad 
  3. The nature and pattern of your employment 
  4. Your main place of interest 
  5. Your plans to live in Ireland for the foreseeable future, according to the evidence provided
