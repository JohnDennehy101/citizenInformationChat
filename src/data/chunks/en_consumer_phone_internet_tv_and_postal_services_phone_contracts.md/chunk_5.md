##  Mobile phone contracts

There are 2 main plans that mobile phone providers offer:

**Prepay** : This is a pay-as-you-go option where you buy credit from various
outlets such as shops, bank machines and online and top up your phone when you
need to. Some providers offer prepay options that include calls, texts and
data. You don’t need to sign to a contract and are free to switch networks at
any time.

**Bill pay** : This means that you get a monthly bill for the services you
have used in the previous month and will pay a set price. The duration of the
contract will usually be either month-to-month or 12 to 24 months. If you go
above your allowance of calls, texts and data you will have to pay extra. When
you enter into a bill pay contract, your contract is with the mobile network
provider.

Bill pay plans usually give you the option to either buy a phone outright or
buy it (either free or at a significantly lower price) as part of a bundle.
There is also the option of a SIM-only plan where you don’t need a new phone
and simply sign up to a monthly bill pay contract for calls, texts and data.
