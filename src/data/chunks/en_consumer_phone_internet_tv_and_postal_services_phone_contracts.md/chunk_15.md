###  Methods of billing

You can receive your bills electronically (for example, email) or through the
providerâ€™s website. If you are not able to access bills in an electronic
format because of limited access to the internet or other issues, the provider
must give you a paper bill free of charge. You must be told when the bill is
available online (for example, by sending you a text message).

When you switch to a new provider, your first bill may be higher than
expected. This is because you are paying from the date your service was
connected as well as the price plan for the month ahead. You may receive a
single bill for a bundle (home phone, broadband and TV) but if you make calls,
texts or data outside your allocated allowance, you will be charged at a much
higher rate.
