##  What information should I get when I sign up to a contract?

Providers of fixed or mobile services must give you the following information
in your contract:

  * The name and address of the service provider 
  * Details of the service to be provided, the quality levels and the waiting periods for first-time connections 
  * Details of the pricing and charges (tariffs) 
  * Maintenance service available and if any charges apply 
  * The duration of the contract and how to renew or cancel it 
  * Your right to compensation or refund if service quality levels are not met 
  * Details of the complaint handling procedure 

These consumer rights are set out in the [ European Communities (Electronic
Communications Networks and Services) (Universal Service and Users' Rights)
Regulations 2011
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/si/337/made/en/print) .

When you sign up to a new contract, you can only be bound to the contract for
an initial minimum period of 24 months (2 years) or less. You can keep your
existing landline or mobile phone number when switching to a new provider
(known as ‘porting’ or ‘number portability’). Once the contract has been
agreed, the number should be activated within a few hours.
