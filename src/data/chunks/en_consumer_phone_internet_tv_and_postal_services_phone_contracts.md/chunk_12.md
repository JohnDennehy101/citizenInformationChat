###  If you signed up in person

You donâ€™t have the legal right to a 14-day cooling-off period if you signed up
in person, for example you met a salesperson and signed the contract in the
shop premises.

Any costs and charges for cancelling your contract should be made clear in
your contract and at the point of sale.
