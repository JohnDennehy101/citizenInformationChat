###  What is roaming?

Roaming is using your mobile phone while abroad. In the past, service
providers could charge roaming fees on top of your regular mobile phone bill.

[ EU regulations
](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_654) mean
that mobile phone customers are charged the same price for calls, texts and
data when travelling in the European Economic Area (EEA), which include all
European Union countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. You should be
aware that you may still be charged roaming rates for international travel
outside the EEA.

You should also be able to access the same services while travelling in the
EEA as you can at home. For example, if you have 5G in Ireland, you should
have 5G when you travel (if it is available).

ComReg advises you to check with your service provider to confirm your data
allowance before travelling.
