###  What is a fixed line contract?

Fixed line is commonly known as your landline or home telephone. A fixed line
means that your telephone (or the stand for a cordless telephone) is not wire
free but is physically connected to a point on a wall in your home. Many
providers now offer fixed line services as part of a package (also known as a
‘bundle’) along with home internet, and sometimes TV.
