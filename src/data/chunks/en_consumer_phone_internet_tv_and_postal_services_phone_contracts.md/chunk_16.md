##  Calling non-geographic numbers (such as 1800 numbers)

A _non-geographic number_ (NGN) is a type of telephone number that is not
linked to a specific geographic region or ‘area code’. An NGN is any phone
number beginning with 1800 and 0818.

NGNs are used by many businesses and charities, as well as public services and
banking services.

Calls to 1800 numbers from landlines and mobiles are free. Calls to 0818
numbers cost the same as calling a landline number.

If your bundle includes landline calls, then calls to NGNs are included in the
bundle.
