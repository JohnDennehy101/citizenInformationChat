###  Provision for court review

Where a mortgage lender rejects the borrowerâ€™s proposal for a PIA, an
application can be made for a court review of that rejection. Since 25 June
2021, all mortgages in arrears or the subject to an alternative payment
arrangement can seek a court review of the rejection. Before 25 June 2021,
this review option only applied to mortgages that were in arrears on 1 January
2015, or to mortgages that were in arrears before that and where the borrower
entered into an [ alternative repayment arrangement ](/en/housing/owning-a-
home/mortgage-arrears/alternative-mortgage-repayment-arrangements/) .

As part of [ Abhaile, the national Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service
](https://www.mabs.ie/en/abhaile/) , an [ aid and advice scheme
](/en/housing/owning-a-home/mortgage-arrears/abhaile-mortgage-arrears-
support/) for people in serious mortgage arrears covers free legal
representation for eligible borrowers in seeking such a court review.

The court will review the application, including any objections made by
creditors. Subject to meeting certain criteria set out in the legislation, the
judge may impose the original PIA proposal on the creditor(s).
