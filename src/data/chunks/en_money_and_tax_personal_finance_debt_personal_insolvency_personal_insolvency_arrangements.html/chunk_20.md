###  Creditors’ meeting

When you have consented to the proposal for a PIA that has been formulated by
your PIP, the PIP must call a creditors’ meeting. If there is only one
creditor, he or she may write to the PIP indicating agreement or rejection.
The creditors vote on whether or not to accept the proposed arrangement. Each
vote is proportional to the amount of debt owed to that creditor. Creditors
representing 65% or more of the value of the total debt – both secured and
unsecured – must vote in favour, for the arrangement to be accepted. In
addition, over 50% of your secured creditors and 50% of unsecured creditors
must vote in favour.

The [ Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015
](http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PR15000598) provides for court review
where a mortgage lender rejects the borrower’s personal insolvency proposal.

The Abhaile [ aid and advice scheme ](https://www.mabs.ie/en/abhaile/) for
people in serious mortgage arrears covers free legal representation for
eligible borrowers in seeking such a court review.

If the proposal is accepted, the PIP must inform the Insolvency Service and
tell creditors of their right to object to the relevant court - (the Circuit
Court in cases up to €2.5 million and the High Court in larger cases). The
Insolvency Service notifies the court. If there is any objection, the
protective certificate remains in place until the matter is decided.
