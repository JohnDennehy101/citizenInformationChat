###  Ending of a Personal Insolvency Arrangement

If the arrangement ends other than by successful completion, you will become
fully liable for all specified debts, **inclusive** of arrears, charges and
interest that have accrued during the PIA period, **less** any payments made
by you during that time, **unless** the terms of the PIA specify, or the court
has ordered, otherwise.

If the arrangement is successfully completed, you are discharged from the
unsecured debts covered by the arrangement. **You will not be discharged from
the secured debts, except where this was explicitly provided for in the PIA.**
The successful completion is recorded on the Register of Personal Insolvency
Arrangements.
