###  Excluded and excludable debts

The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 specifies certain types of debt that
**cannot** be written off by the debt settlement procedures that it
introduced, which include the Personal Insolvency Arrangement. These are
called _excluded_ debts.

The Act specifies certain other types of debt to be _excludable_ from a PIA.
This means that they can be covered by the PIA if the creditor is asked and
agrees to let them be included – in which case they become _permitted_ debts –
debts that the creditor permits to be covered. If the creditor is asked and
does not respond, the creditor is also deemed to have consented to the debts
being included. Most types of excludable debts are those owed to the State.

The types of debt that are _excluded_ and cannot be covered by a PIA are:

  * Debts under family law orders, such as [ maintenance orders ](/en/birth-family-relationships/separation-and-divorce/maintenance-orders-and-agreements/) for spouses and children 
  * Debts due under court awards for personal injury or death 
  * Debts arising from a loan (or forbearance of a loan) obtained through fraud or similar wrongdoing 
  * Debts arising under court orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Acts or fines imposed by the courts for criminal offences 

The types of debt that are _excludable_ and may be covered if the creditor
agrees are:

  * Taxes, duties, charges or levies owed to the State, such as income tax, the [ Local Property Tax ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/housing-taxes-and-reliefs/local-property-tax/) , [ VAT ](/en/money-and-tax/tax/duties-and-vat/value-added-tax/) , capital taxes 
  * Service charges owed to local authorities 
  * Rates 
  * Money owed under the [ Nursing Homes Support Scheme ](/en/health/health-services/health-services-for-older-people/fair-deal-scheme/) (in respect of a loan advanced by the HSE to a nursing home resident to cover the amount due from the principal private residence) 
  * Money owed to the Department of Social Protection, such as overpayments 
  * Debts due to owners’ [ management companies ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/home-owners/management-companies-for-apartment-blocks/) in respect of annual service charges or contributions due for multi-unit developments (this is the only non-State debt in this category)
