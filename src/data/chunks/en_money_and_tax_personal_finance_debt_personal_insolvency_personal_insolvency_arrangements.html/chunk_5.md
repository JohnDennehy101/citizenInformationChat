###  Qualifying debts

You will only qualify for a PIA if you owe debt to at least one secured
creditor holding security over Irish property or assets (secured debt). If you
have no secured debts you should apply for a [ Debt Settlement Arrangement
](/en/money-and-tax/personal-finance/debt/personal-insolvency/debt-settlement-
arrangements/) or a [ Debt Relief Notice ](/en/money-and-tax/personal-
finance/debt/personal-insolvency/debt-relief-notices/) . In general, the total
of your debt to your secured creditors must add up to less than €3 million.
However, this cap can be waived if all of your secured creditors agree in
writing.

At least three-quarters (75%) of your debts must have built up at least 6
months before you apply for a PIA – in other words, you can’t apply for a PIA
if any more than 25% of your debts were incurred in the last 6 months.
