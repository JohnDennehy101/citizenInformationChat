###  Mandatory terms of a PIA

There are certain elements that the PIA **must** contain:

  * The maximum duration of the agreement must be 6 years but this may be extended by up to 1 year in circumstances as specified in the terms of the arrangement 
  * The PIA must clearly distinguish between secured debts and unsecured debts and must make provision for the manner in which the security held by the creditor is to be treated. Unless your secured creditors agree otherwise, they may get the full value of their security or the full amount of the debt if the property is sold. If they agree to accept less than the full value of the security, there is a clawback if the security is sold for greater than the value estimated at the time of the arrangement. 
  * If you keep to the terms of the agreement your remaining debts to your unsecured creditors will be discharged 
  * You remain liable for certain debts unless the proposed arrangement explicitly provides for a compromise agreement and the creditor has agreed in writing to accept this – see ‘Excluded and excludable debts’ above 
  * The PIA cannot release you from fines or other monetary penalties arising from criminal offences 
  * It cannot require you to sell any assets that are reasonably necessary for your employment or business unless you agree to such a sale 
  * You must be left with enough income to maintain a reasonable standard of living for yourself and your dependants 
  * It must not require you to dispose of your principal private residence (your home) or to cease to occupy it unless specific conditions are met – see ‘Secured creditors’ below 
  * It must outline how your debts will be treated in the event of your death or mental incapacity 
  * It must provide that your circumstances be reviewed by the Personal Insolvency Practitioner at regular intervals (not more than 12 months) during the currency of the PIA; this review will involve the preparation of a new Prescribed Financial Statement that must be sent to all the creditors. 
  * It must make provision for the Personal Insolvency Practitioner’s costs
