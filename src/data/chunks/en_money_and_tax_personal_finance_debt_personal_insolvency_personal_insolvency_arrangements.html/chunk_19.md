###  Secured creditors

The PIA must provide for the way in which security held by your creditors is
treated. Unless they agree otherwise, they may get the full value of their
security or the full amount that you owe them if the security (such as a
second property) is sold.

When formulating the proposal for a PIA, the PIP will ensure, as far as is
reasonably practicable, that you are not required to sell or move out of your
principal private residence (your home). If you wish to move out, or if the
PIP believes that the running costs of staying in your home are
disproportionately large, the PIA may provide for you to move out of it.
