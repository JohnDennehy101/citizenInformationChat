###  Posters and signs

It is illegal to put up posters or signs on poles or other structures in
public places, unless you have written permission in advance from the owner of
the pole or structure. Any poster, sign or advertisement must have either the
name and address of:

  * The person promoting or arranging the event being advertised 
  * The person on whose behalf the poster, sign or advertisement is being put up 

Political parties or candidates must remove posters within 7 days of the
election. If posters are not removed by this deadline, the local authority
will remove them and issue an on-the-spot fine of â‚¬150 for each offence. Your
local authority has more information on the rules on election posters.
