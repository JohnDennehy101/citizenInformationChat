###  **Passport Online**

Your child must have their own passport and cannot be included on your
passport. You can apply for your childâ€™s first passport using the [ Passport
Online ](https://passportonline.dfa.ie/Apply/Passport) service from anywhere
in the world on a smartphone, tablet, or computer.

If you are unable to access Passport Online, contact your [ local Irish
Embassy or Consulate ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/embassies/) for
information on how to get a paper form and how to submit it. You cannot
download an application form.

The Department of Foreign Affairs has up-to-date information on [ what
documents you will need ](https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/passports/documentary-
requirements/child/#First%20time%20applicant%20born%20abroad) for the
application.
