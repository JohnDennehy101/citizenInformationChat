##  Introduction

If you have been dependent on someone and they die, you may need financial
support.

**What types of financial support can I claim?**

  * The Department of Social Protection may be able to offer you a [ one-off payment ](/en/social-welfare/death-related-benefits/benefits-and-entitlements-following-a-death/) to help you cope in the short term. 
  * If you have long-term needs, you may qualify for **short-term or long-term social welfare payments** . This may mean you continue to receive the social welfare payment that used to be paid to the person who has died, for 6 weeks after their death. Or it may mean you receive a social welfare pension, allowance or payment in your own right. 
  * If you have difficulty in paying your rent, you may be eligible for [ Rent Supplement ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-welfare-schemes/rent-supplement/) or the [ Housing Assistance Payment ](/en/housing/renting-a-home/help-with-renting/housing-assistance-payment/) . If you have problems with your mortgage payments, see our document on [ Mortgage Protection ](/en/housing/owning-a-home/buying-a-home/insurance-protection-on-mortgages/) for information on insurance that may pay off a mortgage in full in the event of a death. 

**Am I eligible?**

Each form of support has different requirements. You may need to meet certain
PRSI requirements or pass a means test.

For information on specific requirements, contact [ your local Social Welfare
Office ](https://www.gov.ie/en/directory/category/e1f4b5-intreo-offices/) .
