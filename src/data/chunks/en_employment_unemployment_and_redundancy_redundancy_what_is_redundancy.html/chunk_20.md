###  You are made redundant on sick leave

If your employer decides to make you redundant while you are on sick leave,
you may be able to bring a claim for [ unfair dismissal
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/unfair-dismissal/) .

Unless your employer can prove there was a [ genuine redundancy situation
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-
procedures/) and that fair procedures were followed, your dismissal may be
found to be unfair.

Even if a genuine redundancy situation exists, you may bring a claim for
unfair dismissal if you think that you were unfairly selected for redundancy.
Your employer should apply selection criteria that are reasonable and are
applied in a fair way.
