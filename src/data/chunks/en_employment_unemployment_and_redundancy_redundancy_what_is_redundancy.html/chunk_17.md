####  If your employer is insolvent

If your employer’s business becomes insolvent, a liquidator, provisional
liquidator, receiver or any other person, may be appointed by the courts to
manage the business.

They are called the ‘responsible person’, and they take the place of your
employer in the consultations.

The rules on collective redundancies which apply to your employer, also apply
to the responsible person.

Responsible persons can continue consultations started by your employer. They
don’t have to restart the 30-days’ notice after their appointment.

These rules are set out in the [ Employment (Collective Redundancies and
Miscellaneous Provisions) and Companies (Amendment) Act 2024
](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2024/act/14/enacted/en/index.html) .
