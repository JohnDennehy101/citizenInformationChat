##  What counts as genuine redundancy?

Your employer must be able to justify that there is a genuine reason for
making you redundant.

A genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to
make you redundant.

Reasons for redundancy include:

  * **Financial difficulties** within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced. 
  * **Lack of work** : for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary. 
  * **Reorganisation** within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists. 
  * **Business closure** : the business is closing down or moving.
