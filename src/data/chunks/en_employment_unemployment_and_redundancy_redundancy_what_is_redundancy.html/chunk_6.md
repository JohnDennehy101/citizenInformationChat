###  Redundancy

Redundancy is dismissal from your job, caused by your employer needing to
reduce the workforce resulting in your job no longer existing.

The burden of proof is on your employer to show that a legitimate redundancy
situation exists and that therefore the dismissal is fair.

For the dismissal to be fair, your employer must also show that you were [
fairly selected for redundancy ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-
redundancy/redundancy/redundancy-procedures/) and that fair procedures were
followed.

If you do not agree that the dismissal is fair, you need to show one or more
of the following:

  * That there is no economic justification for the redundancy 
  * The reasons you have been given for redundancy are not genuine 
  * You have been replaced 
  * Fair procedures have not been followed 
  * You were unfairly selected for redundancy (for example because of your age or race)
