##  Lay off and short-time working

If there is a lack of work available or changes to the financial circumstances
of the business, your employer may lay you off or reduce your working hours
(put you on short-time) for a number of weeks.

A lay-off is when your employer tells you that they expect you to have **no
work** for a temporary period and you will not be paid.

Short-time working is when your hours and pay **are reduced** due to a
decrease in work.

In some cases when you have been in a [ lay off or short-time working
](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/redundancy/lay-off-short-time-
working-and-redundancy/) situation for a certain length of time you may be
entitled to claim redundancy.
