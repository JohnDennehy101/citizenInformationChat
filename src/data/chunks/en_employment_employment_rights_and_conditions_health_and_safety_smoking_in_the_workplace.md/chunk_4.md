###  Exempt premises

Certain premises are exempt from the ban on smoking in the workplace,
including:

  * [ Prisons ](/en/justice/prison-system/prison-system-in-ireland/)
  * Police station detention areas 
  * Nursing homes 
  * Hospices 
  * Religious order homes 
  * The Central Mental Hospital 
  * [ Psychiatric hospitals ](/en/health/health-services/mental-health/admission-to-a-psychiatric-hospital/)
  * Bedrooms in hotels, guesthouses and bed and breakfast accommodation 
  * Third-level educational residential facilities. 

While these places are exempt, employers can still designate certain areas of
their premises as _smoking_ or _non-smoking_ to minimise risk.

For example, the owners of a nursing home could specify that residents can
only smoke outside or in a designated smoking room.
