##  Introduction

Where a person has acted negligently and their negligence has caused you loss,
you may be entitled to compensation from that person. This can arise in a
number of contexts.

For instance, you could be injured in a car accident due to another road
userâ€™s negligence. You may sustain injuries during an assault or during a
poorly carried out medical procedure. Your house or apartment could be poorly
constructed and you may be entitled to sue those responsible for its
construction. You may receive advice which is fundamentally incorrect and,
after acting upon it, find out that you are financially worse off.

For an act or omission of a wrongdoer to be negligent in the legal sense:

  * The wrongdoer must owe you a duty of care 
  * The wrongdoer must have failed to meet that duty of care in their actions 
  * The act or omission must have been the cause of your loss 

A duty of care arises where it is reasonably foreseeable that if a person acts
negligently, they will hurt you and there is some relationship between them
and you.

For example, a driver has a duty of care to other road users. A business has a
duty of care to its customers. A doctor has a duty of care to their patients.

In deciding whether a wrongdoer has failed to meet their duty of care, their
actions are judged against an objective standard.

In other words, did the driver exercise the normal amount of caution in the
circumstances? Did the business comply with all its obligations? Did the
doctor act to the standard of a comparable colleague?

If you are entitled to compensation, it will normally be composed of 2
elements:

  1. General damages for the non-financial losses, such as pain and suffering 
  2. Special damages for the financial losses, such as loss of income and extra expenses
