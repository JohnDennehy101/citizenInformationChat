##  Park and ride facilities

Car parking is available at certain Luas stops. You pay for parking before
boarding the tram or by using [ ParkByText ](http://www.parkbytext.ie/) . If
you do not have a Luas ticket valid for travel on the day you park at a Luas
stop, you will have to pay an additional charge when you leave the car park.

[ More information on park and ride services and facilities

[ Bicycle parking ](https://luas.ie/bike-parking.html) is available at most
Luas stops. The only bicycles permitted on the tram are folding bicycles
stored in a carrier bag.
