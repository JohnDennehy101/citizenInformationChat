###  February 2026 mid-term break

All **primary schools** close on Thursday, 19 February 2026, and Friday, 20
February 2026. Primary schools can use 3 discretionary days to extend this to
a 5-day break starting on Monday, 16 February 2026, unless they need these
days to make up for time lost due to unforeseen school closures.

Unforeseen school closures might happen, for example, due to bad weather.

**Post-primary schools** close for a week, from Monday, 16 February 2026, to
Friday, 20 February 2026 inclusive, unless changes are needed to make up for
time lost due to unforeseen school closures.

If a post-primary school needs to make up such time, it can shorten the mid-
term break by staying open, up to and including Wednesday, 18 February 2026.
