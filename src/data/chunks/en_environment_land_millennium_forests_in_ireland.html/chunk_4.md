##  Millennium Forests

As part of the millennium (year 2000) celebrations, over 1,500 acres of native
woodland were designated as "People's Millennium Forests". This native
woodland is divided into 16 forests around the country and includes newly
planted native forestry and restored native woodlands.

Under this initiative, a native tree was planted on behalf of each household
in Ireland. A total of 1.2 million native trees were planted. Every home was
issued with a certificate giving details about the tree and its location.

It is not possible to locate individual trees, but your household will still
be able to find which forest your tree was planted in. You can [ check which
forest your tree is located online.
