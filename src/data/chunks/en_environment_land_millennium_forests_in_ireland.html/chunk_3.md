##  Forestry grants and schemes

There are several [ schemes for forestry.
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/farming-grants-and-
schemes/#b1d8f8) Some provide grants to help people develop new forests and
others are for people managing existing forests.

**Establishing new forests**

The schemes for developing new forestry aim at increasing Irelandâ€™s forest
cover and counter climate change.

The 2 main grants for planting new forestry on your land are the following:

  * [ Afforestation Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/afforestation-scheme/)
  * [ Native Tree Area Scheme ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/land/native-tree-area-scheme/)

These were announced in the [ Forestry Programme 2023-2027 (pdf)
](https://assets.gov.ie/268252/59e8729c-9e6a-4221-bbc6-d1a5d9fa2f44.pdf) .

You should hire a registered forester to submit your application on your
behalf. Check Gov.ie for a [ list of registered foresters and forestry
companies ](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/205869-list-of-registered-
foresters/) .

you manage the land, depending on your situation.
