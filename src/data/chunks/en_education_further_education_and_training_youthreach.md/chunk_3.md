###  How Youthreach works

The course generally lasts from 1 to 2 years, although it can be flexible,
depending on your individual needs. If you complete the basic training
successfully, you will be awarded a Foundation Certification from [ Quality
and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) ](http://www.qqi.ie/) or the [ Junior
Certificate. ](/en/education/state-examinations/junior-cycle-exam-and-
results/) Having completed a Foundation Programme, you may continue to a
Progression Programme. This will give you the opportunity to progress to the [
Leaving Certificate Applied ](/en/education/state-examinations/leaving-
certificate-applied/) course or a higher-level QQI award or you can choose to
continue other skills training, such as an [ apprenticeship
](/en/education/further-education-and-training/apprenticeships/) course.

The courses take place in Youthreach centres managed by Education and Training
Boards (ETBs) and Community Training Centres. Generally, Youthreach centres
are open for 35 hours per week (9 a.m. - 4.30 p.m., Monday to Friday).

If you qualify for Youthreach, you may also be eligible for the [ Back to
Education Initiative ](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/24e75-back-to-education-
initiative/) .

**Education and Training Boards**

Since 1 July 2013, Education and Training Boards (ETBs) replaced Vocational
Educational Committees (VECs). All services provided by VECs will continue to
be provided by ETBs. F√ÅS training centres have also transferred to ETBs.
