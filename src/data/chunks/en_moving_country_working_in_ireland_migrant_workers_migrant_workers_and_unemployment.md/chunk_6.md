###  **Jobseeker's Benefit**

You may be entitled to [ Jobseekerâ€™s Benefit(JB)
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-
payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-benefit/) when you lose your job or are
made redundant. To get JB you must be unemployed, looking for work and have
paid a certain number of social insurance (PRSI) contributions.

**EEA migrant workers** may [ combine their social insurance contributions
paid in another EU country ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-
welfare/irish-social-welfare-system/claiming-a-social-welfare-payment/social-
insurance-contributions-from-abroad/) to help them qualify for JB.

EEA workers who do not qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit and are actively
looking for work will meet the habitual residence requirement for [
Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) ](/en/social-welfare/supplementary-
welfare-schemes/supplementary-welfare-allow/) . If you been working in Ireland
for less than 12 months, you can get SWA for 6 months from the date your
employment ended. If you have been employed for more than 12-months, you can
get SWA as long as you are actively looking for work. SWA is a means-tested
payment.

You can read about [ EU/EEA citizens and social welfare
](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving-country/working-in-
ireland/migrant-workers/eu-citizens-and-social-welfare/) .

**Non-EEA migrant workers** who qualify for JB can get it if they are legally
resident in Ireland.

**Non-EEA students** are not entitled to social welfare payments in Ireland.
