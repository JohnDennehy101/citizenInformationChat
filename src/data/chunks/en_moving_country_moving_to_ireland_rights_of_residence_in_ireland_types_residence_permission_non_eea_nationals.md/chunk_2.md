##  Introduction

If you are not a citizen of the [ European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland
](/en/government-in-ireland/european-government/european-union/european-
union/) , there are various types of residence rights or permission to remain
that allow you to live in Ireland. Permission to remain is granted by the
Department of Justice and Equality and consists of a special stamp endorsed on
your passport. This is usually called a residence stamp. The various types of
stamp and their meanings are covered in detail below.
