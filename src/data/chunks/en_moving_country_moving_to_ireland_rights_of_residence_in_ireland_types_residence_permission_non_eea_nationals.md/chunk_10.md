###  Visitors and others who are not allowed to work

If you are coming to Ireland as a visitor, a tourist, the spouse, partner or
dependant of an employment permit holder, or in order to receive medical
treatment, you will get a _stamp number 3_ on your passport. You will not be
entitled to work or engage in any business or profession while in Ireland. The
length of time that this stamp is valid will depend on your circumstances.

However, a spouse or de-facto partner of a [ Critical Skills Employment Permit
](/en/moving-country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/green-card-
permits/) , General Employment Permit, Hosting Agreement or an Intra-Corporate
Transferee permit can get a Stamp 1G on their passport which allows them to
work. To get a Stamp 1G, you must be legally resident and granted permission
to live in Ireland under the Non-EEA Family Reunification Policy. Find out
more about [ employment permits and family members ](/en/moving-
country/working-in-ireland/employment-permits/spousal-work-permit-scheme/) .
