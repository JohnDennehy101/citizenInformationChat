Under the [ Irish Born Child Scheme (IBC/05)
](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-
ireland/irish-born-child-renewals/) non-EEA national parents of children born
in the State **prior to 1 January 2005** can apply for permission to remain
based on parentage of an Irish citizen child.

The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in the Zambrano case [ C 34/09
](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=80236&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=3314741)
, that an EU member state may not refuse the non-EU parents of a dependent
child who is a citizen of, and resident in, an EU member state the right to
live and work in that member state. Non-EEA parents who meet the [ Zambrano
criteria ](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/Pages/WP16000113) may be given [
permission to live and work in Ireland as the parent of an Irish citizen child
