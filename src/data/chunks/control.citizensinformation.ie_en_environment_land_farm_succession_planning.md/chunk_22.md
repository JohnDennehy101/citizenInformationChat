###  Changing the registration details of your herd number

You Regional Veterinary Office (RVO) normally looks after issues with your
herd number. When they are told that a farmer has died, they will:

  * Record the death on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine’s systems 
  * Begin transferring herd registration details to the new owner 
  * Arrange the registration of a ‘herd keeper’ to look after livestock in the herd, if this is necessary. A herd keeper is responsible for looking after a herd but may not be the owner of the herd.
