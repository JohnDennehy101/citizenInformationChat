###  Define your farm business

Before transferring your farm, it is important to define your farm business.
You will have expert knowledge of your own farm, so it is essential to write
this down for your successor.

You should include:

  * The number of hectares you own 
  * The number of hectares you rent 
  * Your herd number 
  * Your farm bank account number 
  * The farm schemes you are getting 
  * Information about the people you deal with, such as customers, contacts in the bank, farm merchants, accountants or advisors 

It may also be helpful to bring your successor along to meetings with these
people during the succession process to help them to get a greater
understanding of the business.
