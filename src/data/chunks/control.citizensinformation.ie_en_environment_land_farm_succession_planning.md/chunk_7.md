###  **Transferring to a family member**

Farmers often prefer to keep the farm in the family. This may involve
transferring the farm to a son, daughter, nephew or niece. A useful step in
this process is to start a [ registered farm partnership
](https://www.gov.ie/en/service/b29f0-register-farm-partnership/) .

This involves sharing the farm business with your successor. This gives your
successor experience managing the farm and can help share the workload as you
step back.
