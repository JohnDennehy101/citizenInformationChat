###  Enduring power of attorney

You can set up an enduring power of attorney (EPA) to allow another person, to
look after your financial or personal affairs, if in the future you canâ€™t do
so yourself.

Having an enduring power of attorney is a good way of planning for a time when
you may not be able to make certain decisions for yourself, including making
decisions on farm succession.

This is just one of the [ legal arrangements you can make if you become
incapacitated ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/health/legal-matters-
and-health/assisted-decision-making-act/) or unable to deal with your affairs.
