##  Summary and indictable offences

In Irish law [ criminal offences can be tried ](/en/justice/criminal-
law/criminal-trial/criminal-trial/) in two ways:

  * In the lower court ( [ District Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/district-court/) ) in front of a [ judge ](/en/justice/courtroom/judge/) without a [ jury ](/en/justice/courtroom/jury/)
  * In the higher courts ( [ Circuit Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/circuit-court/) , [ Central Criminal Court ](/en/justice/courts-system/high-court/) ) in front of a judge and jury 

A summary offence is an offence which can only be dealt with by a judge
sitting without a jury in the District Court. While offences which can or must
be tried before a judge and jury are called indictable offences.

All common-law offences are indictable offences as the common law did not
distinguish between indictable and non-indictable offences. However, criminal
statutes or criminal laws that have been passed into law do differentiate
between types of crimes and how they will be dealt with by the courts.

When the District Court deals with an offence, the judge can only impose a
certain length of sentence for an offence. The [ Criminal Justice Act 1984
(Section11)
](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1984/en/act/pub/0022/sec0011.html#zza22y1984s11)
states that the District Court can impose a maximum sentence of 2 years
imprisonment when it is sentencing for a number of offences at the same time.
Similarly, the District Court cannot exceed a [ maximum sentence of 1 year for
1 offence ](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1951/en/act/pub/0002/sec0004.html)
.

Examples of summary offences include the following public order offences:

  * Begging in an intimidating or threatening manner. The penalty for being found guilty of this offence is a [ class E fine ](/en/justice/criminal-law/criminal-trial/fines-for-criminal-offences/) or up to one month in prison or both a fine and a term of imprisonment. 
  * Threatening abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place. The penalty for a person found guilty of this offence is a class D fine or up to 3 months in prison or both a fine and a term of imprisonment.
