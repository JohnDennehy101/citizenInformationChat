###  Returning to work

By law, you have the right to return to the same job with the same contract of
employment. If this would be too difficult for your employer to arrange, then
they must provide you with suitable alternative work. The terms of your new
job must not be ‘less favourable’ than those of your previous job.

When you take paternity leave, the law protects you against [ penalisation
](/en/employment/enforcement-and-redress/victimisation-at-work/) and [ unfair
dismissal ](/en/employment/unemployment-and-redundancy/dismissal/unfair-
dismissal/) . If you have a dispute with your employer over paternity rights,
you can complain to the Workplace Relations Commission – see ‘Having problems
taking paternity leave’ below.
