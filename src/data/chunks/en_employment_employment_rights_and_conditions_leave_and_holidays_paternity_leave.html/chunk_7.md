##  When can I take paternity leave?

You can choose to take paternity leave at any time in the 26 weeks after the
birth or adoption. You need to give your employer notice that you want to take
paternity leave and specify the dates you plan to take. You must do this in
writing at least 4 weeks before your leave.

You must provide a certificate from your partner’s doctor stating when your
baby is due, or stating the baby’s actual date of birth if you apply for leave
after the birth.

If you are adopting, you must provide a certificate of placement showing the
date when the child was placed with you.
