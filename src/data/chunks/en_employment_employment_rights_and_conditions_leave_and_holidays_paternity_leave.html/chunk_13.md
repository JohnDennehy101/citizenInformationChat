###  Death of a parent

Fathers may be entitled to [ maternity leave ](/en/employment/employment-
rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/maternity-leave/) or [ adoptive leave
](/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/adoptive-
leave/) if the mother dies. The number of weeks you can take as leave depends
on how many weeks after the birth the mother dies. The leave starts within 7
days of the mother’s death.

If you have not already taken paternity leave, you can take it at the end of
this maternity leave or adoptive leave.

If the parent entitled to paternity leave dies, the surviving parent may be
able to use their paternity leave.
