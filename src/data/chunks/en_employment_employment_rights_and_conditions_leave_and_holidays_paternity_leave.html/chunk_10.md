###  Can I postpone paternity leave?

You can postpone paternity leave if, for example, the birth is later than
expected or if there is a delay in the placement of an adopted child.

If you are sick before your paternity leave starts, you can postpone the
paternity leave until you recover. You should notify your employer in writing
and provide evidence of your illness.

If your baby is hospitalised, you can ask your employer in writing if you can
postpone all or part of your paternity leave.
