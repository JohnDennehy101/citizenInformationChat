###  The National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)

The NFQ describes what you need to know about qualifications as a learner. It
allows you to compare qualifications, to make decisions about your choice of
course and to know that it will be recognised in Ireland and abroad. The
framework is made up of 10 levels from certificate to doctoral level and
describes qualifications across the Irish education and training system.
