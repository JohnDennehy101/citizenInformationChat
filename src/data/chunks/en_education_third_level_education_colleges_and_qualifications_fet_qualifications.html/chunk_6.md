###  Validation of individual learning

As an individual learner, you can contact QQI directly to find out how to get
certification or recognition for your existing knowledge, skill or competence.
QQI will decide how this prior learning and prior experience can be assessed
and they may look for help and advice from the providers of education and
training in making this assessment.

When you apply to a college they may take into account your educational
background, work history, community involvement and other achievements when
deciding your suitability for the course. This system is known as the
Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning (APEL) or [ Recognition of Prior
Learning (RPL)
