###  Admission to an approved psychiatric centre

When you arrive at the centre, you will be examined by a consultant
psychiatrist. You may be detained for a maximum of 24 hours in the centre for
this examination. If the psychiatrist believes you are suffering from a mental
disorder, they make an admission order to make you a patient of the centre. If
they do not, you will be free to leave the centre. The admission order lasts
for 21 days and you can be kept in the centre for treatment for this time.

A renewal order may extend this period by a further 3 months. This must be
made by the consultant psychiatrist responsible and they must have examined
you in the week before making the order. A further renewal order may be made
by the same psychiatrist for a period of up to 6 months and subsequently for
up to 12 months at a time.

A mental health tribunal will review your case every time a renewal order is
made. If you have a renewal order of between 3 and 6 months, you can request
an additional review after 3 months.
