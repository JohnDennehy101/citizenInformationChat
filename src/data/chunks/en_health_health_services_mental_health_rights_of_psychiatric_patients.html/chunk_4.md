###  Your best interests

Under the Mental Health Act 2001, if you are admitted to or are receiving
treatment in approved centres (that is, psychiatric hospitals or inpatient
services), your best interests should be considered before any decision about
your care and treatment is made. You have the right to be treated with dignity
and respect and the right to be listened to by all those working on your care
team. You are entitled to take part in decisions that affect your health and
your care team should consider your views carefully. You have the right to be
fully informed about your legal rights, your admission and treatment.
