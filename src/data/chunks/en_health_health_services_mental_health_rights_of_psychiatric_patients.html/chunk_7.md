###  Review of admission by a mental health tribunal

When the Mental Health Commission receives a copy of an admission or renewal
order, it must  

  * Refer the matter to a mental health tribunal 
  * Assign a legal representative to represent you unless you personally engage one 
  * Arrange for another consultant psychiatrist to examine you, interview the consultant responsible for your treatment and care and review your records in order to decide whether you are suffering from a mental disorder. The tribunal's report must be given within 14 days to the Commission and to your legal representative.   

The tribunal is appointed by the Mental Health Commission. It must consist of
a lawyer as chairman, a consultant psychiatrist and a lay person (a person who
is not a lawyer or doctor). Tribunal members have been selected and trained by
the Mental Health Commission.

The tribunal must review your detention and make a decision within 21 days of
the making of the order (there are provisions for extending this time limit).
If it is satisfied that you are suffering from a mental disorder and that the
proper procedures have been followed (or, if they have not, the failure does
not affect the substance of the order and does not cause an injustice) then it
affirms the order. If it is not satisfied, it revokes the order and directs
that you be discharged.

The tribunal has similar powers to a court, including the power to require the
attendance of the relevant people and the production of documents. The
tribunal is, of course, obliged to respect the usual requirements of natural
justice, for example, it must ensure that you have copies of the reports that
are being considered by the tribunal.

The tribunal must notify its decision, in writing, to  

  * The Mental Health Commission 
  * The psychiatrist responsible for your care and treatment 
  * You and your legal representative 
  * Any other person the tribunal considers should be notified.
