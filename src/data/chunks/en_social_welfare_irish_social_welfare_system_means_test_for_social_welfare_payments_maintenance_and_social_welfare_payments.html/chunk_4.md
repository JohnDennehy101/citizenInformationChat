###  **Maintenance not taken into account**

Since 4 June 2024, child maintenance payments are not included in the means
test for social assistance payments. However, if you are getting maintenance
that is not child maintenance, this will continue to be means-tested. For
example, any spousal maintenance you get will be means tested.

Half of your assessable maintenance is disregarded (not taken into account) in
the means test for the following payments:

  * [ Jobseeker's Allowance ](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/social-welfare/social-welfare-payments/unemployed-people/jobseekers-allowance/) (JA)
