###  **Jobseekerâ€™s Allowance**

Since 4 June 2024, child maintenance payments are excluded from the means test
for all social welfare payments.

Previously, if you were getting Jobseeker's Allowance, any maintenance paid to
your parent on your behalf was assessed as [ benefit and privilege
](https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/626ffc-operational-guidelines-jobseekers-
allowance-benefit-and-privilege-me/) against you. If a portion of the
maintenance was paid directly to you, this portion was assessed as cash income
against you, and the remainder (which was paid to your parent) was assessed as
benefit and privilege.
