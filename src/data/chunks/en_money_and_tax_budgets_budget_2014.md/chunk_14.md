###  Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplements

From January 2014 the minimum contribution towards Rent Supplement and
Mortgage Interest Supplement for couples will be increased by €5 per week,
from €35 to €40. This aligns Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplement
contributions with the local authority rents structure. This change applies to
new and existing recipients.

The minimum contribution for single people, including single people with
children (currently €30), will not change.

The Mortgage Interest Supplement (MIS) scheme will be closed to new entrants
and will be wound down for existing recipients over a 4-year period from 1
January 2014.
