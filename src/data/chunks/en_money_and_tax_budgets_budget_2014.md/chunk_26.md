####  Home Renovation Incentive

A scheme of tax relief for home renovation work is being introduced for a
period of 2 years.

The Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) will provide an income tax credit of up to
€4,050 to homeowners who carry out renovation and improvement works on their
principal private residences in 2014 and 2015. It will be payable over the 2
years following the year in which the work is carried out. The credit will be
calculated at a rate of 13.5% on all qualifying expenditure over €5,000, up to
a maximum of €30,000.

Qualifying works include extensions and renovations to the home, window-
fitting, plumbing, tiling and plastering. Builders must be fully tax-compliant
and all expenditure and relief claims will have to be registered
electronically with the Revenue Commissioners.
