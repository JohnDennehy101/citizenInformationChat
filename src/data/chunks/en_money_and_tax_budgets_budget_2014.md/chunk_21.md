###  Bereavement Grant

From January 2014 the Bereavement Grant of €850 will be discontinued.

The Funeral Grant under the Occupational Injuries Scheme will continue to be
paid. The six weeks' payment after death (where the deceased person’s payment
continues for 6 weeks to their spouse or partner who is also getting a weekly
welfare payment), the Widowed or Surviving Civil Partner’s Grant of €6,000 and
assistance with funeral costs under Exceptional Needs Payments are unaffected.
