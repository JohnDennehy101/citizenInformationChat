###  Household Benefits Package

From January 2014 the Telephone Allowance will be discontinued for existing
and new recipients. The value of the allowance is €9.50 per month per
household. The Free TV Licence and Electricity Allowance or Gas Allowance paid
under the Household Benefits Package will continue to be paid with no changes
to rates. There are no changes to the Free Travel Scheme and the Fuel
Allowance Scheme.

In 2014 the annual payment to RTÉ for the Free TV Licence will reduce by €5
million to €54.17 million. This will not affect recipients who will continue
to get a free TV licence.
