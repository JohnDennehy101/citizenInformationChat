###  Capital Gains Tax

The relief from Capital Gains Tax (CGT) (in respect of the first 7 years of
ownership) **for properties purchased between 7 December 2011 and 31 December
2013** is being extended by one year to include properties bought to the end
of 2014. Where property purchased in this period is held for seven years the
gains accrued in that period will not attract CGT.

A **new Capital Gains Tax incentive is being introduced to encourage
entrepreneurs** (in particular "serial" entrepreneurs) to invest and re-invest
in assets used in new productive trading activities.

**Capital Gains Tax retirement relief** is being further extended to disposals
of leased land in circumstances where, among other conditions, the land is
leased over the long-term (a minimum lease of 5 years) and the subsequent
disposal is to a person other than a child of the individual disposing of the
farmland. The purpose of the measure is to encourage older farmers who have no
children to whom to transfer their farm to lease out their farmland over the
long term to younger farmers.
