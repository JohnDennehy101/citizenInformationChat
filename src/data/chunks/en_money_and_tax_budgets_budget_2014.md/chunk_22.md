###  Miscellaneous savings

In 2014 savings of €2.1 million will be achieved in Exceptional Needs Payments
(under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme) arising through the
standardisation of payments.

The value of certain social welfare payments will be recovered by the
Department of Social Protection from insurance companies in respect of
compensation awards arising from an accident or injury. Savings of €21 million
will be made from this reform measure.

Additional savings of €30 million will be realised in fraud and control
measures during 2014.
