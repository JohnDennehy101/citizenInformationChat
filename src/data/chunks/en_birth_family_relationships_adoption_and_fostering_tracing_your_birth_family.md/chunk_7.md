##  Updating your contact preferences

When an application for information is received, only preferences on the
register at that point in time can be released with the associated
information. If you want to update your details or contact preferences you
previously recorded on the NACPR, you need to fill out a new CPR application
form and send it to the Adoption Authority with a copy of photo identification
such as a passport or driverâ€™s licence. The Adoption Authority will
acknowledge that it has received your application and update your details.
