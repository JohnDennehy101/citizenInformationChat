##  Contact Preference Register

The new Contact Preference Register is a way for people to state their contact
preferences in relation to contact with family, including a request for
privacy. The Contact Preference Register (CPR) replaces the previous National
Adoption Contact Preference Register (NACPR). All data from the NACPR has been
transferred over to the new register.

The CPR is similar to the NACPR with some additional functions. It allows
people to register their wishes in relation to contact with family, as well as
provide contact details, information and items for sharing with specified
family members. The CPR is not a tracing service. For more information about
tracing services, see ‘Tracing Service’ below.

The Adoption Authority is responsible for the CPR. This means the Adoption
Authority is the agency that identifies all potential matches on the CPR.
