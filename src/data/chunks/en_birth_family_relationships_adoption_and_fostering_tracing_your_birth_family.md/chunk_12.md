##  How do I apply?

Many societies, institutions, or agencies that held records in the past on
people who were adopted, boarded or nursed out, had their birth illegally
registered, or who lived in a mother and baby home as a child, have since
closed. At the time of closing, available records were transferred either to
the Adoption Authority or Tusla for safekeeping. You will need to make an
application to either one, or both, depending on which agency holds the
records you are seeking access to. See a [ list of adoption agencies and
societies ](https://www.birthinfo.ie/what-options-do-i-have/list-of-adoption-
agencies-and-societies) and which agency currently holds the records.

It is possible that both Tusla and the Adoption Authority may **both** hold
information and records that you are requesting. You will need to make a
separate application to each organisation to find out what information exists.
