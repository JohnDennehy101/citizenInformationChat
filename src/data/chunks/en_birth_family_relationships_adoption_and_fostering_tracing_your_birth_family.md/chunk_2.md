##  Introduction

If you were adopted, you may want to find your birth family. Or, you might be
a birth parent trying to trace your child who was adopted. The new [ Birth
Information and Tracing Act 2022 (pdf)
](https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/act/2022/14/eng/enacted/a1422.pdf)
provides a right of access to birth certificates, birth and early life
information for people who were adopted, boarded out, the subject of an
illegal birth registration or who otherwise have questions in relation to
their origins.

You can also access information if you are a child of a [ relevant person
](https://www.tusla.ie/services/birth-information-and-tracing-and-
adoption/information-and-tracing/seeking-your-personal-and-birth-
information/faqs/#Who%20can%20apply%20for%20information%20under%20the%20Act?)
and your parent has died, or you are the next of kin of a child who died in an
institution. A 'relevant person' is someone who was adopted, the subject of an
illegal birth registration, was boarded out or lived as a child in an
institution.

While it is possible to trace your birth family or child on your own (or with
the help of a private detective), it is recommended to use the established
official channels. This is to make sure that neither party is forced into
something they are unwilling or unable to cope with.
