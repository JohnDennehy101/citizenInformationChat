##  Tracing Service

If you want to locate and make contact with a birth relative, a Tracing
Service is available to you.

The Tracing Service can assist with sharing information while supporting a
level of contact (if any) that both you, and the person you are seeking, are
comfortable with.

You can apply for the service if you were:

  * Adopted 
  * Boarded out 
  * The subject of an illegal birth registration 
  * A parent or a genetic relative of the relevant person 
  * In a mother and baby home, county home or institution 

More details on [ who can apply for a tracing service is available at
birthinfo.ie ](https://www.birthinfo.ie/what-options-do-i-have/apply-for-a-
tracing-service) .

Information on the Contact Preference Register may be used as part of a
Tracing Service search. But itâ€™s important to note that they are 2 separate
services and need to be applied to separately.

There is no charge for the Tracing Service or to make a tracing request.
