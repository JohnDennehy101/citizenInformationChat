###  Where a preference for no contact is registered

If a match is made on the register but a preference for no contact has been
made, this preference will be communicated to the other person (the match) in
an information session. During the session, you will be informed of your
entitlement to your birth information, the parentâ€™s right to privacy and their
expressed wish for no contact. Once the information session has taken place,
all available information will be released to you.

Where parents register a preference for no contact, they will be informed of
their right to access counselling, which will be provided by Tusla.
Counselling can also be provided to all parents and relevant persons who
request it.
