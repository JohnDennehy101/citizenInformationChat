##  Enrolling your child at post-primary school

You can send your child to the post-primary school of your choice, provided
there is a place available. Where there is shortage of space, the school must
give priority based on the admissions policy. This is drawn up by the board of
management and should be available to you on request.

To enrol your child, check [ the list of post-primary schools in your area
](http://www.education.ie/en/find-a-school) . Contact the school of your
choice to see if there is a place available. The school of your choice may
place your child on a waiting list or you may need to contact other schools to
find a place.

You can find out more about [ admissions to school ](/en/education/the-irish-
