    <html><body><p>Budget 2012 was announced on 5 December and 6 December 2011. <strong>This
document will be updated throughout the week as details become
available.</strong></p><p>The main Budget changes which may affect people living in Ireland are set
out below. </p><p>This document sets out changes in the areas of taxation, social welfare,
health, housing, education, employment and other areas. It is an overview and
not a complete statement of the measures announced in Budget 2012.</p><p>Some of the changes announced in the Budget come into effect immediately.
Others take effect from the beginning of January 2012. Many others have to be
finalised before coming into effect. Some elements of these measures may change
when the Finance Bill is published – this is expected in early 2012.</p><p>For a full list of the Budget changes, please see the Department of Finance
website, <a href="http://www.budget.gov.ie">budget.gov.ie</a>. You can find a
summary of the social welfare changes on the Department of Social Protection's

  <section class="block-richtext">
    <html><body><h3>Income tax</h3><p>There are no changes in the existing rates or income tax bands. There are
also no changes to existing tax credits.</p><p>However, Illness Benefit will now be taxed from the first day of payment;
previously the first 6 weeks (36 days) were exempt from tax.</p><h4>Domicile levy</h4><p>The Irish citizenship condition for payment of the levy is being removed.
This will mean that liable non-residents will not be able to avoid the levy by
changing their citizenship status.</p><h3>Universal Social Charge (USC)</h3><p>People with an income of less than €10,036 will no longer pay the
Universal Social Charge. Currently, people with an income below €4,004 do not
pay USC.</p><h3>PRSI</h3><p>The current relief of 50% of employer PRSI for employee contributions to
pension schemes has been abolished. (1 January 2012)</p><p>PRSI will be expanded to cover rental, investment and other forms of income
from 2013.</p><h3>Value-Added Tax (VAT)</h3><p>The standard rate of VAT will be increased from 21% to 23% from 1 January
2012. This only affects goods which are already liable to the 21% rate.</p><p>The rate of VAT will be reduced from 21% to 13.5% on district heating, for
example, where heating is supplied from a central source to a number of
business premises within a building. This brings this form of heating in line
with other energy suppliers.</p><p>Open farms will be liable to charge VAT at 9% on admission fees from 1
January 2012.</p><h3>DIRT (Deposit Interest Retention Tax)</h3><p>DIRT will be increased from 27% to 30% for payments made annually or more
frequently. DIRT will be increased from 30% to 33% for payments made less
frequently than annually. Exit tax on life assurance policies and investment
funds are also being increased by 3% to 30% for payments made annually or more
frequently and 33% for payments made less frequently than annually. (1 January
2012)</p><h3>Excise duties</h3><h4>Tobacco products tax</h4><p>Excise duty on a packet of 20 cigarettes is being increased by 25 cent
(including VAT) with a pro-rata increase on other tobacco products. (From
midnight on 6 December 2011)</p><h4>Alcohol</h4><p>Legislation will be published in 2012 to deal with alcohol abuse issues
(including low-cost alcohol sold in off-licences and supermarkets).</p><h4>Carbon tax</h4><p>The carbon tax will be increased by €5 to €20 per tonne of CO2 emitted
on fossil fuels.</p><p>The increase will apply to petrol and auto-diesel from midnight, 6 December
2011. Find out more about the impact of this change on page 21 of the <a href="http://budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2012/Documents/Taxation%20Annexes%20to%20the%20Summary%20of%202012%20Budget%20and%20Estimates%20Measures.pdf">Taxation
Annexes document (pdf)</a>.</p><p>The increase will apply from 1 May 2012 to kerosene, Marked Gas Oil, Liquid
Petroleum Gas (LPG), fuel oil and natural gas. (This is to take account of the
effect the increase would have on home heating costs over the winter
months.)</p><p>The carbon tax will not apply to solid fuels, so there will be no increases
for peat or coal.</p><h4>Betting duty</h4><p>It is proposed to extend betting duty of 1% to remote betting and to
introduce a betting intermediaries’ duty (Gross Profits Tax of 15%) to cover
betting exchanges. This provision is being legislated for in the Betting
(Amendment) Bill. Following publication of the Bill there is a legal
requirement to notify the EU Commission 3 months before enactment of the Bill.
It is intended that the new taxation regime will commence from the second
quarter of 2012.</p><h3>Property taxes</h3><h4>Household charge</h4><p>A household charge of €100 is being introduced in 2012. This charge will
fund local services, in line with the requirement in the EU/IMF Programme of
Financial Support for Ireland. The charge is an interim measure pending design
and implementation of a full property tax in 2014.</p><p>Homeowners (not tenants) will be liable for the household charge. The charge
does not apply to social housing or housing provided by a charity. There will
be a waiver for those on Mortgage Interest Supplement and for those residing in
certain categories of unfinished housing estates. Provision will also be made
to allow payment of the charge in instalments.</p><h4>Mortgage interest relief (MIR)</h4><p>Mortgage interest relief will no longer be available to house purchasers who
purchase after the end of 2012 and will be fully abolished from 2018, as
previously announced.</p><p>First time buyers in 2012 will get mortgage interest relief at 25% for the
first two years, 22.5% for years 3 and 4 and 20% for years 6 and 7. For first
time buyers the upper thresholds for tax relief are €20,000 for people who
are married, in a civil partnership or widowed and €10,000 for people who are
unmarried and not in a civil partnership. </p><p>Non-first time buyers in 2012 will get mortgage interest relief at 15%. The
upper thresholds for non-first-time buyers for tax relief are €6,000 for
people who are married, in a civil partnership or widowed and €3,000 for
people who are unmarried and not in a civil partnership.</p><p>The rate of mortgage interest relief will be increased to 30% for first time
buyers who took out their first mortgage between 2004 and 2008.</p><h4>Stamp duty</h4><p>The current stamp duty arrangements for residential property will continue
to apply with 1% on transactions up to and including €1 million and 2%
thereafter.</p><p>Multiple stamp duty rates for non-residential properties (including
farmland, commercial and industrial buildings) will be abolished. The current
top rate of 6% will be replaced with a flat rate of 2% in respect of
instruments executed after midnight 6 December 2011. </p><h4>Section 23 reliefs – small investors</h4><p>Reliefs in Section 23 type investments will continue at the present rate for
investors with an annual gross income under €100,000. These small investors
are regarded as being vulnerable to insolvency.</p><h3>Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT)</h3><p>The current CAT rate of 25% is being increased to 30%. This increase applies
in respect of gifts or inheritances taken after 6 December 2011. </p><p>The current Group A tax-free threshold is being reduced from €332,084 to
€250,000. This reduction applies in respect of gifts or inheritances taken
after 6 December 2011. Group A applies where the beneficiary, the person
receiving the benefit, is a child of the person giving it. This includes a
stepchild or an adopted child. </p><h3>Capital Gains Tax (CGT)</h3><p>The current CGT rate of 25% is being increased to 30%. This increase applies
in respect of disposals made after 6 December 2011.</p><p>Property purchased between midnight 6 December 2011 and the end of 2013 and
held for at least seven years will not be liable for Capital Gains Tax for
those seven years.</p><h3>Pensions</h3><h4>Approved Retirement Funds</h4><p>The tax on the value of assets in an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) at 31
December each year is being increased from 5% to 6% for ARFs with asset values
over €2 million. This also applies where an individual owns more than one
ARF, where the aggregate value of the assets in those ARFs exceeds €2
million. (31 December 2012 and future years)</p><p>It is proposed to apply a higher final liability tax rate of 30% to the
transfer of transfer of ARF assets on the death of an ARF owner to a child of
the owner aged over 21. The details of this will be published in the Finance
Bill.</p><h4>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)</h4><p>The provisions which apply to ARFs will also apply on the same basis to
'vested' PRSAs, where the assets are retained in the PRSA rather than being
transferred to an ARF. This includes an increased deemed distribution
percentage of 6% for vested PRSAs with assets in excess of €2 million.
Further details will be published in the Finance Bill. (31 December 2012 and
future years)</p><h4>Employer PRSI on pension contributions</h4><p>The current relief of 50% of employer PRSI for employee contributions to
occupational pension schemes and other pension arrangements is being removed.
(1 January 2012)</p><h3>Motor tax rates</h3><p>Motor tax rates for all categories will increase. (1 January 2011)</p><p>Motor tax for cars in band A will go up from €104 to €160, and band B
goes up from €156 to €225. Band C will go up from €302 to €330, Band D
- €447 to €481, Band E - €630 to €677, Band F - €1,050 to €1,129,
Band G - €2,100 to €2,258.</p><p>Motor tax rates based on engine size will also increase. For example,
engines with 1,001 to 1,100cc will go from €259 to €278; 1,601 to 1,700cc
engines will go from €471 to €506; 2,001 to 2,100cc engines will go from
€784 to €843.</p><p>Motor tax on electric vehicles will increase from €146 to €157.</p><h3>Vehicle Registration Tax</h3><p>The current CO2 bands will be reviewed with a view to adjusting the bands by
1 January 2013.</p><p>For full details see Annex C of the <a href="http://budget.gov.ie/Budgets/2012/Documents/Summary%20of%202012%20Budget%20and%20Estimates%20Measures%20Policy%20Changes.pdf">Summary
of 2012 Budget and Estimates Measures (pdf)</a>.</p><h3>Corporation tax</h3><p>The 3 Year Tax Relief for Start-up Companies scheme provides relief from
corporation tax on the trading income and certain gains in the first 3 years of
trading. It is being extended to include companies which start up in 2012, 2013
or 2014.</p><h3>Farmers</h3><h4>Stock relief for registered farm partnerships</h4><p>An enhanced 50% stock relief (100% for certain young trained farmers) for
registered farm partnerships is being introduced and will run until 31 December
2015 subject to clearance with the European Commission under State Aid
rules.</p><h4>Measures to incentivise timely farm transfers</h4><p>Full retirement relief from CGT for intra-family transfers will be
maintained for individuals aged 55 to 66. An upper limit of €3m on retirement
relief is introduced for business and farming assets disposed of within the
family (where the individual transferring the assets is aged over 66 years).
This will incentivise earlier transfer of farms.</p><p>(The current unlimited amount applies for a transitional period of 2 years
for individuals currently aged 66 or who reach that age before 31 December
2013.)</p><p>The current upper limit of €750,000 for assets transferred outside the
family for individuals aged between 55 and 66 years will be maintained. The
upper limit for retirement relief for business and farming assets transferred
outside the family is reduced from €750,000 to €500,000 for individuals
aged over 66 years.</p><p>(The current upper limit of €750,000 applies for a transitional period of

    <html><body><h3>People of working age </h3><p>There will be no changes to weekly rates of social welfare payments.</p><h4>Jobseeker’s Benefit and Allowance</h4><p>Where a Jobseeker's Benefit recipient is working for part of a week, the
payment entitlement will be based on a 5-day week rather than a 6-day week.
This means that for each day that a person is unemployed, one-fifth of the
normal rate of Jobseeker's Benefit is payable and if they get part-time work
for 2 days, they will get three-fifths of the normal Jobseeker's Benefit for
that week. (July 2012)</p><p>Sunday working will be taken into account when calculating the amount of
Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance to be paid. (January 2013)</p><h4>One-Parent Family Payment</h4><p>The upper age limit of the youngest child for new claimants will be reduced
to 12 years in 2012. (It is currently 14 years for new claimants.) It will be
reduced further to 7 years on a phased basis in following years.</p><p>The means test for OFP is being amended:</p><ul>
<li>The amount of earnings disregarded in the One-Parent Family Payment means
    test will be reduced from €146.50 to €130.00 per week in 2012 for new
    and existing recipients. Half the weekly earnings in excess of this amount
    will also be disregarded. (January 2012)</li>
<li>Further reductions will be introduced over the following 4 years: to
    €110 in 2013, €90 in 2014, €75 in 2015 and €60 in 2016. </li>
<li>The temporary payment of half the One-Parent Family Payment rate where
    the recipient's earnings exceed €425 per week will be discontinued.
    Existing recipients of the temporary payment will not be affected. (January
    2012)</li>
</ul><p>People getting One-Parent Family Payment can get half-rate Jobseeker’s
Benefit, Illness Benefit or Incapacity Supplement if they satisfy the
qualifying conditions. These half-rate payments will cease for applicants for
Jobseeker’s Benefit, Illness Benefit and Incapacity Supplement. (January
2012)</p><h4>Farm Assist</h4><p>The rate of payment will not change. The assessment of means from
self-employment, including farming, is being raised from 70% to 85%. (January
2012)</p><p>The deductions from income for children are being halved to €127 per year
for each of the first two dependent children and €190.50 per year for each
subsequent child. (January 2012)</p><h4>Back to Education Allowance</h4><p>The Cost of Education Allowance, the annual grant which accompanies the Back
to Education Allowance, will be reduced from €500 to €300. (2012)</p><h3>Employment schemes </h3><h4>Community Employment</h4><p>Entitlement to a Community Employment payment and another Department of
Social Protection payment at the same time will be phased out over 3 years.
From January 2012 new participants on Community Employment scheme will not be
able to claim another social welfare payment at the same time.</p><p>If a person is on a Community Employment scheme and One-Parent Family
Payment, Deserted Wife’s Allowance or Benefit or a widow's, widower's or
surviving civil partner's pension, payment of 2 qualified child increases will
cease for both new and existing recipients.</p><p>The training and materials grant for Community Employment will reduce from
€1,500 to €500 per participant per annum. (January 2012)</p><h4>Job Initiative</h4><p>In the Job Initiative scheme the materials allowance will be reduced and
payment of the training budget will be discontinued.</p><h3>Children</h3><h4>Child Benefit</h4><p>Over 2 years the rates of payments of Child Benefit will be standardised for
all children.</p><p>Child Benefit will be maintained at €140 per month for each of the first 2
children. The rates for the third and subsequent children will be standardised
at €140 per child per month over the next 2 years.</p><p>The rate for the third child will be €148 and for the fourth and each
subsequent child will be €160. (January 2012)</p><p>The additional monthly payment for twins and triplets will be maintained but
the grant of €635 paid at birth, at 4 years of age and at 12 years of age for
these multiple births will cease. (January 2012)</p><p><br/>

    <html><body><h4>Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance</h4><p>The age of eligibility for the Back to School Clothing and Footwear
Allowance will be raised from 2 to 4 years of age. (2012)</p><p>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance will reduce from €305
to €250 for children aged 12 years or more and from €200 to €150 for
children aged 4 - 11 years. (2012)</p><h4>Domiciliary Care Allowance</h4><p>The age of entitlement for Domiciliary Care Allowance will be extended from
16 years to 18 years of age. This is to compensate for the raising of the age
of eligibility for Disability Allowance to 18. <strong>(This measure was
announced on 6 December. On 7 December it was announced that this measure is
under review and may not be implemented.)</strong></p><h4>Qualified Child Increases </h4><p>If a person claiming Invalidity Pension, Carer's Benefit, State Pension
(Contributory or Transition) or Incapacity Supplement has a spouse or partner
with income of over €400 a week, payment of the half-rate qualified child
increase will be discontinued. This will apply to new claimants and is in line
with current arrangements for Jobseeker's Benefit, Illness Benefit and Injury
Benefit. (July 2012)</p><p>Payment of 2 qualified child increases where the person is on a Community
Employment Scheme <em>and</em> One Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife’s
Allowance/Benefit or Widow(er)’s Pensions will cease for new and existing
recipients.</p><h3>Carers</h3><h4>Carer's Allowance</h4><p>New applicants for Carer’s Allowance, who are not living with the person
for whom they are providing care, will not be entitled to the Household
Benefits package. The person receiving care may be entitled to the Household
Benefits package in their own right. (April 2012)</p><p>Carer’s Allowance weekly rates of payment will not change. The half-rate
Carer’s Allowance will continue to be paid to people who are full-time carers
and who are getting another welfare payment. The extra payment for caring for
more than one person is retained. Carers will continue to get the annual
Respite Care Grant of €1,700 for each care recipient.</p><h3>People with disabilities </h3><h4>Disability Allowance</h4><p>The age of entitlement for Disability Allowance will increase to 18 years in
line with other social welfare payments. The age of entitlement for Domiciliary
Care Allowance will be extended from 16 years to 18 years of age. <strong>(This
measure was announced on 6 December. On 7 December it was announced that this
measure is under review and may not be implemented.)</strong></p><p>For new claimants aged 18 to 24, the rates of payment for Disability
Allowance will be aligned with Jobseeker's Allowance rates for that age group
(€100 per week for people aged 18 to 21 and €144 per week for people aged
22 to 24). <strong>(This measure was announced on 6 December. On 7 December it
was announced that this measure is under review and may not be
implemented.)</strong></p><p>People who are aged under 25 years and are already getting a full-rate
Disability Allowance payment will not be affected. If people under 25, who are
currently getting Disability Allowance, take up opportunities for education or
training (for example, by availing of the Back-to-Education scheme or Community
Employment) or leave the country and subsequently revert to Disability
Allowance, they will not be subject to the reduced rates.</p><h4>Disablement Benefit</h4><p>New applicants for Disablement Benefit must have a disability classified at
more than 15% to qualify for the payment. (January 2012)</p><h3>Supplementary Welfare Allowance</h3><h4>Rent Supplement</h4><p>The minimum contribution by single tenants towards rent for the purposes of
the Rent Supplement scheme will be increased to €30 per week (from €24 per
week). The minimum contribution payable by couples will be €35 per week.
(January 2012)</p><p>Rent limits will be reviewed. (2012)</p><h4>Mortgage Interest Supplement</h4><p>The minimum contribution for the purposes of the Mortgage Interest
Supplement scheme will be increased to €30 per week for a single person (from
€24 per week). The minimum contribution payable by couples will be €35 per
week. (January 2012)</p><p>Payment of Mortgage Interest Supplement will be deferred for 12 months while
the person engages with the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process. This approach
is consistent with the reports of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Group
and the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears. (2012)</p><p>People getting Mortgage Interest Supplement will be granted a waiver from
the new €100 Household Charge.</p><h4>Fuel Allowance</h4><p>The Fuel Allowance season will be reduced by 6 weeks from 32 weeks to 26
weeks for all recipients (it will now be paid for 6 months from mid-October to
mid-April).</p><h3>Treatment Benefit Scheme</h3><p>The frequency of the grant for hearing aids will change from 2 years to 4
years. (January 2012)</p><p>The maximum grant available for 1 hearing aid will change from €760 to
€500 and from €1,520 to €1,000 for 2 hearing aids. (January 2012)</p><h3>Older people</h3><p>There will be no change in the rates of State pensions or other payments for
those aged over 66, for example, Living Alone Allowance, Household Benefits
Scheme and Fuel Allowance.</p><h4>Changes to contributory State pensions</h4><p>Currently a person with an average of 20 - 47 PRSI contributions per year
over their working life receives a weekly State pension of €4.50 less than a
person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. A lower pension
will be payable to new applicants for State pension who have a yearly average
of less than 48 PRSI contributions. (September 2012)</p><p>Currently, late claims for certain contributory pensions can be backdated on
a reducing scale for up to 5 years. This backdating period will be reduced to a
maximum of 6 months. This applies to State Pension (Contributory and
Transition), Surviving Civil Partner's Contributory Pension and Widow(er)'s
Contributory Pension. (April 2012)</p><h4>Widow(er)’s Contributory Pension and Surviving Civil Partner’s
Contributory Pension</h4><p>New applicants for Widow(er)'s Contributory Pension and Surviving Civil
Partner's Contributory Pension will need a higher total number of paid PRSI
contributions to qualify. The number of paid contributions required will
increase from 156 to 260 contributions from December 2013.</p><h3>Half-rate payments</h3><p>People getting Widow(er)’s Pension, Surviving Civil Partner’s Pension or
One-Parent Family Payment can get half-rate Jobseeker’s Benefit, Illness
Benefit or Incapacity Supplement if they satisfy the qualifying conditions.
These half-rate payments will cease for applicants for Jobseeker’s Benefit,
Illness Benefit and Incapacity Supplement. (January 2012)</p><h3>Means testing for social assistance payments</h3><p>For new and existing claimants, income from employment as a home help funded
by the Health Service Executive (HSE) will be assessed in means tests for
social assistance payments. The existing earnings disregards for the relevant
social welfare payment will apply. (January 2012)</p><p>Income from weekly Carer’s Benefit and Carer’s Allowances will be
included when calculating entitlement to Family Income Supplement in line with
other welfare payments. (January 2012 for new applicants and on renewal for all
others)</p><p>The amount of earnings disregarded for the purposes of the One-Parent Family
Payment means test will be reduced from €146.50 to €130.00 per week in 2012
for new and existing recipients. Further reductions will be introduced over the
following 4 years. (January 2012)</p><p>The temporary payment of half of the rate of One Parent Family Payment where
the recipient's earnings exceed €425 per week will be discontinued. Existing
recipients of the temporary payment will not be affected. (January 2012)</p><h3>Other savings</h3><p>The cost of medical certificates for illness and disability related schemes
will be reduced by 10%. This is an administrative saving in the Department of
Social Protection.</p><p>Savings will be achieved on the Electricity Allowance.</p><h3>Enforcement / compliance</h3><p>Revenue will continue to obtain information on payments made by other
Government bodies (in particular the Department of Social Protection) to allow
Revenue to cross check the status of individuals and improve its collection.</p><h3>Rates of payment</h3></body></html>

  <section class="block-richtext">
    <html><body><h3>Housing</h3><h4>Household charge</h4><p>A household charge of €100 is being introduced in 2012. The charge is an
interim measure pending design and implementation of a full property tax in
2014. Homeowners (not tenants) are liable for the household charge. The charge
does not apply to social housing or housing provided by a charity. There will
be a waiver for those on Mortgage Interest Supplement and for those residing in
certain categories of unfinished housing estates. Provision will also be made
to allow payment of the charge in instalments. This charge will fund local
services, in line with the requirement in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial
Support for Ireland.</p><h4>Mortgage Interest Relief</h4><p>Mortgage interest relief will no longer be available to house purchasers who
purchase after the end of 2012 and will be fully abolished from 2018, as
previously announced.</p><p>First time buyers in 2012 will get mortgage interest relief at 25% for the
first two years, 22.5% for years 3 and 4 and 20% for years 6 and 7. For
first-time buyers the upper thresholds for tax relief are €20,000 for people
who are married, in a civil partnership or widowed and €10,000 for people who
are unmarried and not in a civil partnership. </p><p>Non-first time buyers in 2012 will get mortgage interest relief at 15%. The
upper thresholds for non-first-time buyers for tax relief are €6,000 for
people who are married, in a civil partnership or widowed and €3,000 for
people who are unmarried and not in a civil partnership.</p><p>The rate of mortgage interest relief will be increased to 30% for first time
buyers who took out their first mortgage between 2004 and 2008.</p><h4>Mortgage Interest Supplement</h4><p>The minimum contribution for the purposes of Mortgage Interest Supplement
will increase by €6 to €30 per week for a single person. The minimum
contribution payable by couples will be €35 per week. (January 2012) </p><p>Payment of Mortgage Interest Supplement will be deferred for 12 months while
the mortgage-holder engages with the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process under
the Central Bank’s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears. (2012)</p><h4>Rent Supplement</h4><p>The minimum contribution by single tenants towards rent for the purposes of
the Rent Supplement scheme will increase by €6 to €30 per week. The minimum
contribution payable by couples will be €35 per week. (January 2012)</p><p>Rent limits for Rent Supplement will be reviewed in 2012.</p><h4>Better Energy: Warmer Homes Scheme</h4><p>Some €76 million is provided for energy-efficiency measures under the
Better Energy: Warmer Homes Scheme.</p><p>There is continued funding to assist in the implementation of the Affordable
Energy Strategy through Better Energy: Warmer Homes.</p><h4>Rental Accommodation Scheme</h4><p>An extra €10 million is provided to allow transfers into the Rental
Accommodation Scheme.</p><h3>Employment</h3><h4>Redundancy and Insolvency Scheme</h4><p>Statutory redundancy lump sums are generally paid by employers who are
currently entitled to a rebate from the State of 60% of the relevant amount.
From 1 January 2012 this rebate will be reduced from 60% to 15%.</p><h4>Employment schemes </h4><p>Entitlement to a Community Employment payment and another Department of Social
Protection payment at the same time will be phased out over 3 years. From
January 2012 new participants on Community Employment scheme will not be able
to claim another social welfare payment at the same time. 

</p><p>If a person is on a Community Employment scheme and One-Parent Family
Payment, Deserted Wife’s Allowance or Benefit or a widow's, widower's or
surviving civil partner's pension, payment of 2 qualified child increases will
cease for both new and existing recipients.</p><p>The training and materials grant for Community Employment will reduce from
€1,500 to €500 per participant per annum. (January 2012) </p><p>In the Job Initiative scheme the materials allowance will be reduced and
payment of the training budget will be discontinued. </p><h4>Action Plan for Jobs</h4><p>The Government recently committed to deliver a multi-annual Action Plan for
Jobs, with quarterly targets for delivery every year and a monitoring group to
oversee implementation. The Action Plan for Jobs will address 7 principal
areas:</p><ul>
<li>Improving competitiveness and intensifying competition in sheltered
    sectors</li>
<li>Supporting indigenous start-ups</li>
<li>Assisting indigenous business to grow</li>
<li>Attracting inward entrepreneurial start-ups</li>
<li>Developing and deepening the impact of Foreign Direct Investment</li>
<li>Developing employment initiatives within the community</li>
<li>Exploiting sectoral opportunities, identified as priorities</li>
</ul><p>A Micro Finance Loan Fund, to provide loans on a commercial basis for
start-up businesses and micro-enterprises will operate from early 2012. It is
expected that the businesses that will primarily benefit will be those at the
margins of commercial lending decisions. </p><p>The Temporary Partial Loan Guarantee Scheme is expected to be in place in
the first quarter of 2012. Under the Scheme, the Government will partially
guarantee loans by traditional lenders to viable businesses that are at the
margins of commercial lending decisions and have difficulties accessing
credit.</p><p><a href="http://www.djei.ie/press/2011/20111124.htm">Find out more about the
Partial Loan Guarantee Scheme and the Micro Finance Loan Fund</a>.</p><h4>Labour market activation </h4><p>€20 million has been allocated for a new Labour Market Activation Fund
which will be specifically targeted at the long-term unemployed and will
deliver over 6,500 training education and training places in 2012.</p><p>The Government will shortly publish a policy statement, <em>Pathways to
Work</em>, which will set out its strategy to reform labour market activation
policy to prevent the drift into, and help the reduction of, long-term
unemployment.</p><h4>Administrative efficiencies/rationalisation</h4><p>The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation’s Comprehensive Review
of Expenditure led to the following key outcomes:</p><ul>
<li>Implementation of changes to business process aimed at delivering
    services more efficiently</li>
<li>The streamlining of the State’s employment rights bodies (i.e. the
    Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the
    Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Equality Tribunal and the Labour Court)
    will create a single entry point for all users of the employment rights
    machinery</li>
<li>Greater utilisation of eGovernment tools in the Companies Registration
    Office</li>
<li>A strong commitment to the public service reform agenda, in particular in
    the areas of shared services and outsourcing models in appropriate cases,
    including high-volume case processing operations</li>
</ul><h3>Small and medium enterprises (SMEs)</h3><p>In addition to the Loan Guarantee Fund and Micro Finance Fund, there will be
the following targeted measures for the SME sector:</p><ul>
<li>The first €100,000 of R&amp;D expenditure of all companies will be
    allowed on a volume basis for the purpose of the R&amp;D Tax Credit</li>
<li>The outsourcing arrangements for R&amp;D purposes will be improved in a
    targeted manner to allow the greater of the existing percentage arrangement
    or €100,000</li>
<li>Companies will have the option to use some portion of the R&amp;D credit
    to reward key employees who have been involved in the development of
  R&amp;D</li>
<li>The corporate tax exemption for new start-up companies is being extended
    for the next three years and will be available for companies that commence
    trading in 2012, 2013 and 2014</li>
<li>Smaller companies will also be able to avail of the planned foreign
    earnings deduction where they plan to expand their export markets into the
    BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa).</li>
</ul><p>Other job creation measures will also be examined with a view to their
inclusion in the Finance Bill.</p><h4>Credit for SMEs</h4><p>The Government has set the 2 pillar banks (AIB and Bank of Ireland) the
following SME lending targets: €3 billion each in 2011, €3.5 billion each
in 2012 and €4 billion each in 2013.</p><h4>Universal Social Charge (USC)</h4><p>From 1 January 2012, the exemption level for the Universal Social Charge
(USC) will be raised from €4,004 to €10,036 and the USC will be collected
on a cumulative basis.</p><h4>Absenteeism</h4><p>The existing tax exemption for the first 36 days of Illness Benefit and
Occupational Injury Benefit is removed. The Minister for Social Protection will
bring forward proposals around absenteeism in both the public and private
sectors in 2012.</p><h3>Education</h3><h4>Third-level education</h4><p>The student contribution is increased by €250 per year from the academic
year 2012/2013.</p><p>The student grant is reduced by 3%. This reduction applies to existing and
new grant-holders from January 2012. The value of certain capital assets will
be taken into account in the means test for student grants from 2013.</p><p>New postgraduate students whose means would formerly have qualified them for
the special rate of student grant will now only get a fee grant. They will not
get a maintenance grant. A €2,000 fee grant will be paid to a further 4,000
students. Existing grant-holders will not be affected.</p><p>The allocation to the Fund for Students with Disabilities is reduced by
20%.</p><p>The 5 scholarship schemes for higher education will be replaced by a single
bursary-type, merit-based scheme, with awards of €2,000 per student.</p><p>Core funding for higher education is reduced by 2%.</p><p>The Technological Sector research programme will be terminated.</p><h4>School transport</h4><p>The primary school transport charge increases from €50 to €100. The
maximum family payment for school transport for primary pupils increases from
€110 to €220. The primary school transport charge for concessionary
students reduces from €200 to €100.</p><p>The maximum family payment for second-level pupils stays at €350 and the
overall maximum family payment stays at €650 per year.</p><h4>Pupil/teacher ratio</h4><p>The pupil/teacher ratio for fee-paying post-primary schools will increase
from 20:1 to 21:1 (2012/2013)</p><p>Staffing for all 199 DEIS Band 1 primary schools will be based on a general
average of 1 teacher for every 22 pupils. This will replace the present
arrangement of giving a 'top up' allocation on the existing standard staffing
schedule in order to implement reduced class sizes.</p><p>All 195 DEIS second-level schools will have a reduced pupil/teacher ratio of
18.25:1. (A pupil/teacher ratio of 19:1 applies in non-fee-paying second-level
schools.)</p><p>Staff numbers in primary schools with 4 teachers or fewer will be adjusted
on a phased basis from 2012/2013.</p><p>Post-primary schools will have to manage guidance provision from within
their existing pupil/teacher ratio allocations.</p><h4>Other measures for schools</h4><p>Capitation grants to schools are reduced by 2%. The primary rate will be
€183 and the second-level rate will be €317. The enhanced grant for schools
in the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) programme is not
changing.</p><p>Supports will be withdrawn on a phased basis from some schools that are in
educational disadvantage schemes which pre-date the DEIS programme.</p><p>The Modern Languages in Primary Schools Initiative is being abolished.</p><p>Almost €10 million is provided to start implementation of actions in the
Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, work on Junior Cycle reform and phased rollout
of high-speed broadband to second-level schools.</p><p>Changes will be announced to the operation of the school book grant in order
to incentivise the establishment of book rental schemes in schools. (early
2012)</p><h4>Labour market activation</h4><p>€10 million is allocated to the Springboard initiative to provide
part-time higher education opportunities for unemployed people.</p><p>€20 million has been allocated for a new Labour Market Activation Fund
which will be specifically targeted at the long-term unemployed and will
deliver over 6,500 education and training places in 2012.</p><p>Training and further education programmes provided through the new further
education and training authority (SOLAS) and the VECs will focus actively on
helping unemployed people to return to the labour force. Both SOLAS and the
VECs will liaise closely with the National Employment and Entitlements Service
in the Department of Social Protection.</p><h4>Further education and training</h4><p>Weekly allowances paid to 16-17 year olds on Youthreach, Community Training
Centres and FÁS courses will be reduced to €40.</p><p>The number of apprenticeship places will be reduced.</p><p>Capitation grants for further and adult education courses such as Post
Leaving Certificate (PLC), Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS),
Youthreach, the Back to Education Initiative, and adult literacy will be
reduced by 2%.</p></body></html>
