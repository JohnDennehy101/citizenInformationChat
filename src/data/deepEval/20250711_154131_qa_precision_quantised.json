Mary left work to collect and look after her son and returned to work the following day. Her employer asked if she wanted to take annual leave for the previous day. Mary said that she wanted to take force majeure leave instead as she was urgently needed to care for a close family member. Mary\u2019s employer agreed but said she would to have apply in writing for the force majeure leave.\n\nMary applied in writing for the 1 day force majeure leave. Her application set out her personal details, her relationship to her child, the date and reason for the force majeure leave.\n\nSome months later Mary\u2019s father died suddenly and Mary asked if she could have a day off to go to the funeral. Mary\u2019s employer said that unless she took annual leave she would lose a day\u2019s pay if she went to the funeral. Mary thought that she could take force majeure leave for a day as the Parental Leave Acts 1998 - 2019 allows a maximum of 3 days force majeure leave in a 12-month period. Her employer said that unfortunately force majeure leave is only for the illness of a close family member. It does not give any entitlement to leave following the death of a close family member.\n\n_Page edited: 10 January 2023 _\n\nRelated documents\n\nParental leave\n\nThe Parental Leave Acts 1998-2019 allow parents to take 26 weeks parental leave from employment, up until their child\u2019s 12th birthday.\n\n1240.0995\n\nCase study: Taxation of Maternity Benefit\n\nA case study showing how Maternity Benefit is taxed.\n\n1204.4834\n\nLeave for parents\n\nOverview of the different types of statutory leave entitlements available for working parents.\n\n1152.2386\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you have a question about this topic you can contact the Citizens Information Phone Service on 0818 07 4000 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 8pm).",

This could be, for example, because of regular bonus payments or allowances.\n\nHow to apply\n\nCheck if your employer has a workplace domestic violence policy and follow the process to apply for the leave and other supports available.\n\nDo I need to give notice to my employer?\n\nYou do not have to give your employer notice to take domestic violence leave in emergency circumstances.\n\nYou should give notice if you are able to, or as soon as you practically can after taking it.\n\nDisclosing your experience to your employer\n\nGetting support from your employer means you need to disclose your experience to someone at work. In most jobs, employees usually tell their direct manager about absences.\n\nOr, your employer may assign a specific or designated person to handle matters related to domestic violence leave and other available support. The designated person could be a HR manager or the business owner.\n\nYour employer should make sure the designated person is well-trained to handle employee disclosures properly.\n\nCan my employer ask for proof?\n\nYou are not required to give your employer any supporting information or evidence when requesting domestic violence leave.\n\nThere might be exceptional situations where your employer could ask for supporting documents, but this would be rare and is not in line with the intentions of the law.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nYour employer should treat any information you disclose about domestic violence with the utmost sensitivity and confidentiality.\n\nThey should only share the information with those who need it for safety plans or administering domestic violence leave. Ideally, your employer should get your written permission before sharing any information.\n\nSharing information does not always mean breaking confidentiality. Your employer can find ways to share details without revealing your identity or the fact that you disclosed domestic violence.\n\nYour employment rights\n\nIn general, you will be treated as if you are in work during domestic violence leave.\n\nThis means:\n\nYour time on domestic violence leave does not break your continuous service. It also counts as service when calculating entitlements such as annual leave and public holidays.\n\nYou must not be dismissed for taking or asking to take domestic violence leave.",

They must also give you a minimum amount of notice, depending on how long your tenancy has lasted. These rules apply to private landlords, approved housing bodies and people who let student-specific accommodation.\n\nTerminating a tenancy\n\nIf your landlord wants you to leave your accommodation, they must serve you with a written notice of termination and give you the correct amount of notice .\n\nIf your tenancy has lasted less than 6 months your landlord can ask you to leave without giving you a reason. If your tenancy has lasted more than 6 months your landlord must give you a valid reason why they are terminating the tenancy .\n\nFixed-term tenancies\n\nIf you have a fixed-term tenancy, your landlord cannot end the tenancy before the end of the fixed term unless you breach your obligations . A fixed-term tenancy is an agreement that covers a specific amount of time. It is generally set down in a written contract, called a lease. It may be for any period, but can range from 6 months up to a year or more.\n\nWhat is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\n\nGenerally, your landlord can only end a tenancy after the first 6 months if:\n\nYou do not comply with the obligations of the tenancy , for example, by not paying your rent on time\n\nThe property is no longer suited to your needs, for example, if it is too small\n\nThe landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months. However, this may not apply if the landlord plans to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period \u2013 see \u2018Restriction on terminating when selling multiple properties\u2019 below",
                        "Read more about leases on the website of Threshold, the national housing charity.\n\nPeriodic tenancy\n\nA periodic tenancy agreement does not specify a fixed length of time. The period of the tenancy may be weekly or monthly, depending on how often the rent is due. Periodic tenancy agreements may or may not be in writing.\n\nYour landlord can end the tenancy at any time during the first 6 months of the tenancy without having to give a reason, but, in general, you will get security of tenure after 6 months \u2013 see \u2018Part 4 tenancy\u2019 below. You must always get a valid written notice of termination and there are rules about how much notice you must be given, depending on the length of the tenancy (with some exceptions). Read more in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\n\nAs a tenant, you can end the periodic tenancy at any time. You do not have to give a reason. Again, there are rules about notice periods and what constitutes a valid notice of termination \u2013 see \u2018Ending your tenancy\u2019 below.\n\nClaiming a Part 4 tenancy at the end of a fixed-term lease\n\nIf you have a fixed-term contract or lease and you want to remain in the property under a Part 4 tenancy, you should notify your landlord of your intention to stay in the property. You should do this between 3 months and 1 month before your fixed\u2013term tenancy or lease agreement expires.\n\nIf you do not notify your landlord, you cannot be refused coverage under Part 4, but you may have to compensate the landlord for any financial loss that they have because you did not notify them of your intention to remain in the tenancy.\n\nEnding your tenancy\n\nThe following section outlines what a tenant must do to end a tenancy. There are different rules for landlords who want to end a tenancy . The RTB also has information on their website about how a tenant can end a tenancy .\n\nFormat of termination notice\n\nAs a tenant, you can terminate your tenancy (whether fixed-term or periodic) without giving a reason, but you must give a valid notice of termination to your landlord. In order to be valid, this notice must:\n\nBe in writing\n\nBe signed by you\n\nSpecify the date that you are serving it on the landlord\n\nSpecify the termination date of the tenancy (you have the full 24 hours of this date to vacate possession)",
                        "You do not have security of tenure . This came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (pdf) .\n\nYou cannot be forced to pay for student-specific accommodation during the summer when you don\u2019t need it. Your tenancy or licence arrangement should not be more than 41 weeks, unless you ask for longer. If your landlord does not comply with the 41-week rule you should contact to the RTB, who can sanction your landlord. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024.\n\nYou only need to give your landlord 28 days\u2019 notice when ending a tenancy. You can give your landlord more notice if you want and your landlord must give you more. This came in under the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 .\n\nYou can terminate your fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and you can only terminate your tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 .\n\nFind out more about your rights as a tenant in student-specific accommodation on the RTB\u2019s website .\n\nSecurity of tenure\n\nSecurity of tenure is a tenant\u2019s right to stay in rented accommodation for a set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when you have been renting for 6 months and haven\u2019t received a valid notice of termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons, see our page \u2018 If your landlord wants you to leave \u2019.\n\nThe amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began.\n\nIf your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022 , you have a tenancy of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months, you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date), unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed reasons.",
                        "If this is not done, the notice of termination is invalid. The RTB recommends that landlords use certified post when posting the notice of termination to the tenant and the RTB, and that they keep proof of this.\n\nWhen the RTB receives the notice of termination it will:\n\nWrite to you and your landlord about the RTB services and outline your rights and responsibilities under residential tenancies legislation\n\nAsk for your contact details in case the landlord needs them to offer the property back to you. This will only be done with your consent\n\nThis requirement is in place since 6 July 2022, when it was brought in under the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022.\n\nThe RTB's website has more information about these changes .\n\nWhat is a valid notice of termination?\n\nThe law sets out the requirements for a valid notice of termination. It must:\n\nBe in writing (an email is not sufficient)\n\nBe signed by the landlord (or an authorised agent)\n\nSpecify the date of termination of the tenancy\n\nState that you have the whole 24 hours of the termination date to vacate the property\n\nSpecify the date of the notice itself\n\nState the reason for termination, if a tenancy has lasted more than 6 months or is a fixed-term tenancy. (This does not have to be included for tenancies in student-specific accommodation.)\n\nState that any issue about the validity of the notice or the right of the landlord to serve it must be referred to the RTB within 90 days from the receipt of the notice. (This 90-day timeframe applies unless the tenant is in breach of their obligations.)\n\nYour landlord must give additional details in certain situations and, in some cases, a statutory declaration. The information below describes the additional details needed for each of the valid reasons for terminating your tenancy. The RTB also provides sample notices of termination , with the details required in each situation.\n\nIf the property is being sold\n\nIf your landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months of the terminating your tenancy, the notice of termination must state that:\n\n\u201cThe reason for the termination of the tenancy is due to the fact that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, for full consideration, within 9 months after the termination of the tenancy\u201d.",
                        "They must do this if they ended your tenancy because they:\n\nPlanned to sell the property within 9 months\n\nNeeded the property for their own use or for an immediate family member\n\nPlanned to change the use of the property\n\nPlanned to refurbish the property substantially\n\nYour landlord must make every reasonable effort to get your contact details, so they can offer the property back to you. This includes contacting the RTB to ask for them. The RTB may have your contact details to give to the landlord or they may contact you to get them. The RTB will only pass your details to the landlord if you have given your consent to do this.\n\nWhen your landlord contacts you to offer to re-let the property to you, you have 7 days to accept or reject this offer.\n\nThe RTB website has a step-by-step guide to this procedure .\n\nRestriction on terminating tenancies when selling multiple properties\n\nA landlord cannot terminate a tenancy of more than 6 months if they intend to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period, unless:\n\nThey can show that the market value with a sitting tenant is over 20% below the market value with vacant possession, and\n\nPreventing them from terminating the tenancy would be unduly onerous on them or would cause them undue hardship\n\nThis provision is often called the \u2018Tyrrelstown\u2019 amendment and it is provided for under Section 40 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 .\n\nNotice of termination\n\nIf your landlord wants you to leave, they must serve you with a valid written notice of termination. The notice can be posted to you, be given to you in person or be left for you at your address. Emails and text messages do not qualify as valid notices of termination. If it appears that you are not living in the property, the landlord can affix the notice to the outside of the property.\n\nYour landlord must also send a copy of the notice of termination to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). This must be done at the same time as it is sent to you. It can be emailed to NoticeofTermination@rtb.ie or posted to the RTB along with the RTB Notice of Termination Return Form (pdf) ."

                        "What happens if I need planning permission but don\u2019t apply for it or get\n\nit?\n\nIt is an offence to do work that requires planning permission, without having planning permission. This offence can carry very large fines and possible imprisonment. However, if a genuine mistake has been made, it is possible to apply for planning permission to retain an unauthorised development. This permission can be refused, in which case, the unauthorised development will have to be demolished.\n\nTypes of planning permission\n\nThere are 2 types of planning permission:\n\nPermission\n\nOutline permission\n\nThe most common type of planning permission is permission , which is sometimes called full permission. This is where the local authority agrees to your work. Permission is normally subject to conditions, some of which may require changes to your proposals. Planning permission normally lasts for 5 years.\n\nOutline permission is where you apply to see if the local authority agrees in principle with you building a house or large extension. When applying for outline permission, you only need certain plans and details about your proposal. You need to produce enough for the planning authority to make a decision about the siting, layout or other proposals for development. Generally, outline permission last for 3 years. If you get outline permission, you will then have to submit detailed drawings and get consequent permission before you start building work.\n\nYou must not start building before you get planning permission.\n\nHow much does it cost to apply for planning permission?\n\nYou have to pay a fee with your planning application. Different fees apply to different types of development. For example, the current fee for an application to build a house is \u20ac65. The fee for a house extension or the conversion of a garage for use as part of a house is \u20ac34.\n\nBefore you apply for planning permission\n\nBefore applying for planning permission you must give public notice of your proposals. You do this by:\n\nPutting a notice in a local newspaper (your local authority will have a list), and\n\nPutting up a site notice that can be clearly seen and read\n\nYou will find details of information that must be contained in the notices in the planning application form. Your planning application must be received by the local authority within 2 weeks of the notice appearing in the local newspaper and the site notice going up.\n\nNote:",
                        "How to apply\n\nApplying for planning permission\n\nIf you need to get planning permission you fill in a planning permission form, which is available on your local authority's website . Submit the completed form and the required documents to the Planning Department of your local authority . For new short-term letting use you should apply for planning permission, whereas for existing unauthorised use you must apply for retention permission. It normally takes about 8 weeks to process an application.\n\nWhen making its decision on a planning application about short-term letting the planning authority will take a number of things into account, such as whether the area is experiencing high housing demand, high rent inflation, insufficient supply and lots of planning applications for short-term lets. It should be noted that if this is the case, it is unlikely that planning permission will be granted.\n\nYou can appeal a planning permission decision to An Bord Plean\u00e1la . For more information on how to do this, read An Bord Plean\u00e1la\u2019s Guide to making a Planning Appeal .\n\nRegistering with the local authority\n\nIf you are offering short-term lettings in an RPZ area, but are exempt from the planning permission requirement, you still need to register with the local authority to avail of this exemption.\n\nYou must complete the following forms and provide any additional documents needed and send them to your local authority within the required time limits.\n\nForm 15 \u2013 Start of year notification form. This form should be sent to your local authority within 4 weeks of the start of each year, and no later than 2 weeks before the first short-term let of the year for that property.\n\nForm 17 \u2013 End of year notification form. This should be sent to your local authority between the 1 and 28 January of the year after the lettings have taken place.\n\nForm 16 \u2013 90 day threshold notification form. This should only be sent to your local authority if you are a homeowner temporarily away from your home and reach the 90 day threshold during the year. You should submit the form no more than 2 weeks after the 90 day threshold has been reached.\n\nYou will have to provide documentation proving that the property is your principal private residence.\n\nThese registration forms are available on your local authority's website and they can be sent by email or post. Dublin City Council also has an online application option .\n\nWhere to apply for planning permission\n\nApply to your local authority for planning permission."

Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.\n\nDrafting a pre-nuptial agreement\n\nOnly pre-nuptial agreements entered into following independent legal advice for both parties are likely to be taken into account. The court would have to be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for reviews:\n\nPeriodically (for example, every five years)\n\nIf children are born\n\nIf there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold)\n\nThe agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with the rules of contract law.\n\nThe future of pre-nuptial agreements",
                        "You must notify the personal representative of the deceased of your application for provision from the deceased\u2019s estate within 6 months of an application for a grant of probate .\n\nIn general, if your cohabiting relationship ended two years or more before your ex-partner died, you cannot apply for provision from the estate unless you were getting regular or periodic payments from the deceased.\n\nWhat is a cohabitation agreement?\n\nIf you live with your partner but you do not intend to marry, you should protect your financial interests by entering into a \u2018 cohabitation agreement \u2019 (also called a cohabitant\u2019s agreement). This is a voluntary, signed agreement, which allows you to specify the day-to-day joint financial arrangements of your relationship, such as:\n\nThe payment of joint debts\n\nThe payment of common household expenses\n\nYou can also specify how you plan to separate your assets, such as shared property, should the relationship come to an end. In the event of a break-up, a cohabitation agreement can make the division of your assets more straightforward.\n\nYour cohabitation agreement may include a provision that the redress scheme does not apply to you (for example, you can both agree not to apply for a maintenance order should your relationship end). This is different from similar agreements by married couples. Agreements between married couples cannot exclude either party\u2019s right to apply to the courts for various orders (for example, a maintenance order).\n\nIs a cohabitation agreement valid in court?\n\nIf you and your partner make a cohabitation agreement (an agreement on joint financial matters), it is only valid if:\n\nEach of you has had independent legal advice, or you got legal advice together and have waived the right to independent legal advice (see \u2018More information\u2019 below)\n\nThe agreement is a contract\n\nThe agreement has been signed by each of you\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, the court may set aside or vary (change) your cohabitation agreement (for example, if the enforcement of the agreement would cause serious injustice).\n\nIf you and your cohabitant entered into an agreement before the 2010 Act commenced, it is enforceable.\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are concerned about your rights following the breakdown of your cohabiting relationship, you should get legal advice.",

Your spouse or civil partner must ask for their legal right share within 6 months of being notified, or within 12 months of the taking out of the Grant of Representation.\n\nWhere a legal right share does not apply\n\nYour spouse or civil partner can renounce (give up) their rights to the legal right share. This can be part of an agreement before marriage or civil partnership or the spouse or civil partner can give up their rights to benefit their children or other named beneficiaries.\n\nIf there is evidence of undue influence or evidence that the spouse or civil partner did not understand what they were doing, the renunciation may be challenged. It is normally advised that a spouse or civil partner get independent legal advice if renouncing their legal right share.\n\nThe legal right share can be lost where the spouse or civil partner is:\n\nConvicted of the murder, manslaughter or attempted murder of the deceased person\n\nConvicted of an offence against the deceased person or a child that carries a sentence of more than 2 years\n\nDivorce, separation and desertion\n\nSeparation agreements usually include a renunciation of both spouses\u2019 or civil partner\u2019s legal right share.\n\nIf you are divorced or your civil partnership was dissolved, you do not have to provide a legal right share.\n\nIf your spouse or civil partner deserted you for more than 2 years, they are not entitled to a legal right share unless they deserted you as a result of your behaviour (for example, domestic abuse).\n\nCohabiting partners\n\nPartners, who live with each other but are not married or in a civil partnership, have no automatic legal right to each other's estates, although under the redress scheme for cohabiting couples introduced by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 a qualified cohabitant can apply for a share of the estate of a deceased cohabitant.\n\nYou can leave some or all of your estate to your partner but this does not cancel out the legal rights of a spouse or civil partner if you were married before to someone else and did not get divorced or had your civil partnership dissolved.\n\nRights of children under a will\n\nChildren do not have any absolute right to inherit any of their parent's estate if the parent has made a will. Children born inside or outside marriage and adopted children all have the same rights and there are no age restrictions.",

Usually, if you can show that you made a contribution to the purchase price of the house, you will be entitled to a share in the house in some proportion to your contribution.\n\nFor example, if you paid off half of the mortgage (and the mortgage represented 90% of the purchase price), you may roughly be entitled to 45% of the ownership of the property.\n\nCivil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act\n\n2010\n\nThe Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 sets out certain legal rights and protections that cohabiting couples have, which may allow you seek redress in the courts. To qualify for any redress orders, such as a property adjustment order, cohabiting couples without children have to have lived together in an intimate and committed relationship for 5 years. If you have children together, it is 2 years.\n\nA court will only make such an order if it is satisfied that one partner was financially dependent on the other cohabitant partner.\n\nCohabitation agreements\n\nThe Act also provides for couples to enter into a \"cohabitation agreement\" to set out your financial interests and also determine what will happen with certain assets, such as property, if your relationship should end.\n\nA cohabitant\u2019s agreement can make things more straightforward in the event of a break-up. A court may vary (change aspects of) or set aside a cohabitants\u2019 agreement in exceptional circumstances where enforcing it would cause serious injustice.\n\nWhat if there are children involved?\n\nIf there are children involved, a relationship breakdown can be life-altering. It needs to be handled sensitively to ensure the children\u2019s best interests are prioritised.",
                        "Civil partnership changes your entitlements and obligations regarding:\n\nSocial welfare\n\nTax\n\nLife insurance and pensions\n\nInheritance\n\nMaintenance\n\nShared home\n\nBarring, safety and protection orders\n\nOther consequences of civil partnership\n\nCivil liability: A surviving civil partner may sue for the wrongful death of their civil partner, where the death was caused by the negligence or wrongdoing of another person and has resulted in injury or mental distress to the survivor.\n\nMental health: A civil partner may apply for the involuntary admission to a psychiatric institution of a mentally ill civil partner (provided the parties are not separated and provided the applicant has not been the subject of an application under the Domestic Violence Acts).\n\nPower of attorney: A civil partner must be informed of the registration of an enduring power of attorney. Similarly, an enduring power of attorney in favour of a civil partner is no longer valid if the partnership is dissolved or there is a safety or barring order against the civil partner.\n\nProperty disputes: A civil partner may apply to the courts for a decision in relation to disputes over property with their partner.\n\nTenancies: Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, a civil partner may be able to take over a tenancy on the death of their partner.\n\nFormer spouses who entered into civil partnerships: If you were married to someone and the marriage ended, and then you entered into a civil partnership with someone else, you lose your status as a former spouse. Under divorce legislation, former spouses continue to have the right to go to the courts for maintenance and property orders. However, once a former spouse entered into a civil partnership, this changed. Maintenance orders and pension adjustment orders in favour of a former spouse lapsed if that spouse entered into a civil partnership. A property adjustment order may not be made for the benefit of a former spouse if that spouse has entered into a registered civil partnership.\n\nEnding a civil partnership\n\nWhen a civil partnership breaks down, the civil partners may choose to informally separate and live apart. However, most couples will eventually want to regulate matters between them.\n\nIf a married couple or civil partners can agree the terms on which they will live separately, they may enter into a separation agreement . The agreement is a legally binding contract setting out each party's rights and obligations to the other. The terms of the agreement are usually reached either through mediation or negotiation through solicitors."

If you bought a bike anytime in 2020, you can buy a new bike and receive the next tax relief in January 2024.\n\nWhat are the different kinds of bikes covered?\n\nA cargo bike has a special purpose frame to carry heavy loads or other passengers. A container or a platform may be integrated into, or attached to, this frame in front of, or behind, the rider.\n\nAn ecargo bike is a cargo bike with a pedelec configuration. A bike cannot be converted into a cargo bike by simply attaching a container or a trailer. The frame must be specially designed to carry large or heavy loads or passengers.\n\nWhat if my employer buys me a bike and doesn\u2019t charge me for it?\n\nThat is acceptable.

Before 1 January 2005, everyone born on the island of Ireland was an Irish citizen by birth. Following an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland , citizenship by birth is no longer an automatic entitlement to everyone born on the island of Ireland.\n\nIf you are born abroad, you are entitled to Irish citizenship if your parent was born in Ireland.

Instead, it said that this would be set out in law.\n\nWhen this was replaced by the Constitution of Ireland , anyone who was granted citizenship of the Irish Free State under the provisions of the previous Constitution became a citizen of Ireland. Article 9 of the Irish Constitution says that the future \u201cacquisition and loss\u201d of Irish citizenship would be done in accordance with law.\n\nThe 19th Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was passed following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. This put the right to citizenship by birth in the Constitution.\n\nThe 27th Amendment of the Irish Constitution was passed by referendum in 2004. This removed the automatic right to citizenship by birth for anyone born in Ireland after 1 January 2005 and gave authority back to the Oireachtas (the Irish parliament) to decide on laws about citizenship by birth.\n\nThe Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts\n\nThe Constitution of Ireland allows the Oireachtas to make laws to decide who can become an Irish citizen after the enactment of the Constitution (in 1937). The most important citizenship law that was passed after 1937 was the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1956 .\n\nThis Act had a number of important provisions:\n\nAnyone born in Ireland was automatically an Irish citizen. People who were born in Northern Ireland were entitled to be Irish citizens if they chose it.\n\nA Foreign Births Register was established for descendants of Irish citizens born abroad.\n\nWives of Irish citizens (but not husbands) could claim Irish citizenship by signing a post-nuptial declaration. This practice ended in 2005.\n\nRules for naturalisation were set out.\n\nThe Act was amended a number of times, most importantly in 2004, following the 27th Amendment to the Constitution . This removed the automatic right to Irish citizenship by birth to all those born in Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland and Irish Citizenship\n\nThe Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 gave people born in Northern Ireland the right to claim Irish citizenship if they chose to do so.\n\nThe Good Friday Agreement , which was signed between the Irish and British governments in 1998, confirmed that people born in Northern Ireland could choose to be either British or Irish citizens.Document 5:::\nOne of your parents must have:\n\nLived in Ireland or Northern Ireland for 3 out of the 4 years before you were born or\n\nHave the right to live in Ireland or Northern Ireland without any restriction on their period of residence\n\nOnly reckonable residence is counted towards the 3 out of 4 years needed. This does not include periods spent in Ireland on a student visa or while waiting for a decision on an international protection application .\n\nIf you were born in Ireland after 31 December 2004 and do not qualify as an Irish citizen by birth, you can apply for citizenship by naturalisation after you have completed 5 years of residence in Ireland. You can apply for your child after they have completed 3 years of residence in Ireland.\n\n3. Born outside Ireland to an Irish parent\n\nIf you were born outside of Ireland, you are automatically an Irish citizen by birth if either one of your parents was born in Ireland and was entitled to Irish citizenship.\n\n4. Born in Ireland with no right to citizenship of another country\n\nIf none of the above applies to you and you were born in Ireland, but you are not entitled to citizenship of any other country, you are an Irish citizen by birth.\n\nIrish citizenship when you are born abroad\n\nIf either of your parents was born in Ireland and was an Irish citizen at the time of your birth, you are automatically an Irish citizen by birth.\n\nIf the parent through whom you are entitled to Irish citizenship was deceased at the time of your birth, but would have been an Irish citizen if alive at that time, you are also an Irish citizen.\n\nIrish citizen parent born outside Ireland\n\nIf you were born outside of Ireland and your parent (who was also born outside of Ireland) was an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen at the time of your birth, then you are entitled to become an Irish citizen.\n\nTo claim Irish citizenship, you must have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register , unless your parent was abroad in the public service at the time of your birth. If you are entitled to register, your Irish citizenship is effective from the date of registration \u2013 not from the date when you were born.\n\nCitizenship through descent from Irish grandparent\n\nIf one of your grandparents was born in Ireland, but neither of your parents was born in Ireland, you may become an Irish citizen.

You will need to have your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register .\n\nThe following table may help to explain the situation:\n\n| If you are: | Then you are: ---|---|--- A | Born in the island of Ireland on or before 31 December 2004 | Entitled to Irish citizenship or you are an Irish citizen B | Born on the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 | Entitled to Irish citizenship if one or both of your parents: Is Irish Is British or entitled to live in Northern Ireland or the Irish State without restriction on their residency Is a foreign national legally resident in the island of Ireland for 3 out of 4 years immediately prior to your birth C | Child of A, born outside the island of Ireland | An Irish citizen D | Child of C and a grandchild of A, born outside the island of Ireland | Entitled to Irish citizenship, but you must first register in the Foreign Births Register E | a child of D and a great-grandchild of A, born outside the island of Ireland | Entitled to Irish citizenship, by having your birth registered in the Foreign Births Register, but only if your parent D had registered by the time of your birth.\n\nOther Irish ancestors\n\nUnless at least one parent or an Irish-born grandparent was an Irish citizen at the time of your birth, you have no automatic right to Irish citizenship on the basis of extended previous ancestry (that is, ancestors other than your parents or grandparents). In addition, you cannot claim Irish citizenship on the basis that a relation such as a cousin, aunt or uncle was an Irish citizen if none of your parents or grandparents was an Irish citizen at the time of your birth.\n\nYou can, however, apply for citizenship based on Irish associations, which is at the discretion of the Minister. Irish association means that you are related by blood or through adoption to an Irish citizen.\n\nIf you are considering making an application based on Irish descent or association, you should note the following:\n\nYou should have a reasonable period of legal residence in Ireland (at least 3 years) to show that you have a connection to Ireland.\n\nApplications based on descent from an Irish citizen going further back than a great-grandparent are generally refused.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: Who is entitled to Irish citizenship?\nA:\n1.

There is a specific definition of residence for tax purposes depending on how many days you spend in the country. If you are not resident in a particular year, Ireland can still be your \u2018ordinary residence\u2019 since this term refers to the country where you are usually resident over a number of years. The country that is your permanent home is known as your domicile .\n\nResidence for tax purposes\n\nYour residence for tax purposes depends on the number of days that you are present in Ireland during a tax year. A tax year runs from 1 January to 31 December.\n\nYou are resident for tax purposes for a year if:\n\nYou spend 183 days or more in Ireland in that year or,\n\nIf you spend 280 days or more in Ireland over a period of 2 consecutive tax years, you will be regarded as resident for the second tax year. For example, if you spend 140 days here in Year 1 and 150 days here in Year 2, you will be resident in Ireland for Year 2. You must be in Ireland for a minimum of 31 days each year.\n\nYou are treated as being present in Ireland for a day if you are present at any time during that day.\n\nChoosing to be resident for tax purposes\n\nIf you arrive in Ireland in a particular year but do not have the required number of days for tax purposes, you can still choose to be resident for that year if you will be resident in the following year.\n\nYou must inform Revenue in writing if you choose to be tax resident in Ireland in a tax year.

These are:\n\nSocial insurance payments: (for example, Jobseeker's Benefit )\n\nMeans-tested payments or social assistance payments: (for example, Jobseeker's Allowance )\n\nUniversal payments: (for example, Child Benefit )\n\nWith all social welfare payments in Ireland, you must satisfy the rules for each scheme to qualify. You must also be habitually resident in Ireland to qualify for the following payments:\n\nBack to Work Family Dividend\n\nBlind Pension\n\nCarer's Allowance\n\nChild Benefit\n\nDisability Allowance\n\nDomiciliary Care Allowance\n\nGuardian's Payment (Non-Contributory)\n\nJobseeker's Allowance and Jobseeker's Allowance Transitional payment\n\nOne-Parent Family Payment\n\nState Pension (Non-Contributory)\n\nSupplementary Welfare Allowance\n\nWidow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Contributory) Pension\n\nUK citizens\n\nResidence in the Common Travel Area is treated the same way as residence in Ireland for the purposes of the habitual residence condition (HRC). However, UK citizens who have recently moved to Ireland may find it more difficult to establish that their main centre of interest is in Ireland.\n\nPeople from Ukraine\n\nPeople who have come from Ukraine and who are covered by the Temporary Protection Directive will satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition.\n\nWhat does habitually resident mean?\n\nThe term habitually resident is not defined in Irish law. In practice it means that you have a proven close link to Ireland. The term also conveys permanence - that a person has been here for some time and intends to stay here for the foreseeable future.

These rights are called \u2018derivative rights\u2019 of residence. They are important in situations where an EEA or Swiss parent does not have a legal right to reside based on their own activities, or a Non-EEA citizen cannot apply for a residence card based on the activities of their EEA or Swiss spouse or partner.\n\nA Non-EEA citizen can apply for residence based on a derivative right, or an EEA or Swiss citizen can derive a legal right of residence in the State, which could be important for claiming a social welfare payment or access to local authority housing.\n\nA person with derivative rights does not automatically qualify for permanent residence.\n\nThis table has examples of cases where a derivative right of residence was granted by the CJEU, and explains who can claim residence based on the CJEU decision.Document 6:::\nThe Department provide guidance notes to local authorities with further details about assessing income for social housing support. For example, these guidance notes state that savings are only relevant to the income assessment if they generate an income for applicants, by way of dividend or interest.\n\nIf you are looking for information about any income you have that is not included in the Household Means Policy you should contact your local authority.\n\nWhat is considered alternative accommodation?\n\nYou will be considered as having alternative accommodation if you or a member of your household has property that you could reasonably be expected to use to meet your housing needs. This property will be considered alternative accommodation if you could live in it, or sell it and use the money to pay for suitable accommodation. Alternative property includes property you own abroad, or property that you are renting out. Under residential tenancies legislation you can terminate the tenancy if your household needs the property to live in.\n\nA property will not be regarded as alternative accommodation if it:\n\nIs occupied by someone who is divorced or separated* from a member of the household, or whose civil partnership with a household member has been dissolved\n\nWould be overcrowded if the household lived in it\n\nIs unfit for human habitation\n\nWould not adequately meet the accommodation requirements of a household member with a disability\n\nA couple does not have to be judicially separated in order for this to apply. A deed of separation is sufficient \u2013 see our document on separation agreements .\n\n3. You must need social housing\n\nWhen deciding if your household needs social housing, the housing authority considers:\n\nIs your current accommodation an institution, emergency accommodation or hostel?\n\nAre you homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988 ?\n\nIs your current accommodation overcrowded?\n\nIs it fit for human habitation?\n\nDoes it meet the accommodation requirements of a household member with a disability?\n\nIs it unsuitable for your household\u2019s adequate housing on exceptional medical or compassionate grounds?\n\nIf it is shared with another household, have you a reasonable requirement for separate accommodation?\n\nHas your household\u2019s current mortgage been classified as unsustainable as part of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) ?\n\nIs your household dependent on Rent Supplement to meet its housing need?\n\nIs your current accommodation unsuitable because it does not adequately house your household in any other way, having regard to particular household circumstances?\n\nHow do I apply for social housing?\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is ordinary residence?\nA:\nOrdinary residence refers to the country where you are usually resident over a number of years. It is different from tax residence, which depends on the number of days you spend in a country during a tax year.\n\nIn Ireland, if you have been resident for the previous 3 tax years, then you become ordinarily resident from the start of the fourth year. If you leave the country, you will continue to be ordinarily resident until you have been non-resident for 3 continuous tax years.\n\nFor a married couple or civil partners, the residence status of each spouse is assessed independently of the other. It is possible for one spouse or civil partner to be resident and the other to be non-resident. If you are resident and your spouse is not, you are treated as single for tax purposes.",

In practice it means that you have a proven close link to Ireland. The term also conveys permanence - that a person has been here for some time and intends to stay here for the foreseeable future.

It happens when your job in the company no longer exists, you are let go and are not replaced.\n\nRedundancy is a last option\n\nYour employer must consult with you before deciding to make you redundant. Redundancy is a last option and there must be valid economic, technical, or organisational grounds justifying changes in the workforce.\n\nBefore your employer makes you redundant, they might offer you another job in the business. This is known as \u2018 alternative work \u2019.\n\nWhat counts as genuine redundancy?\n\nYour employer must be able to justify that there is a genuine reason for making you redundant.\n\nA genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant.\n\nReasons for redundancy include:\n\nFinancial difficulties within the business: for example, your employer needs to cut costs and this means staff numbers must be reduced.\n\nLack of work : for example, your employer no longer needs or has a reduced need for employees with your skills or new technology has made your job unnecessary.\n\nReorganisation within the business: for example, your employer has decided to carry on the business with fewer or no staff or the job you do no longer exists.\n\nBusiness closure : the business is closing down or moving.\n\nThe difference between redundancy and dismissal\n\nRedundancy\n\nRedundancy is dismissal from your job, caused by your employer needing to reduce the workforce resulting in your job no longer existing.\n\nThe burden of proof is on your employer to show that a legitimate redundancy situation exists and that therefore the dismissal is fair.\n\nFor the dismissal to be fair, your employer must also show that you were fairly selected for redundancy and that fair procedures were followed.\n\nIf you do not agree that the dismissal is fair, you need to show one or more of the following:Document 1:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Employment > Unemployment and redundancy > Dismissal > Unfair dismissal\n\nUnfair dismissal\n\nWhat is unfair dismissal?\n\nCan I bring a claim for unfair dismissal?\n\nWho cannot bring a claim for unfair dismissal?\n\nHow to bring a claim for unfair dismissal\n\nIf your claim is successful\n\nDismissal from fixed-term or specified-purpose contracts\n\nMore information\n\nWhat is unfair dismissal?\n\nIf you are dismissed from work, the dismissal is automatically considered to be \u2018unfair\u2019 if you are dismissed for:\n\nMembership (or proposed membership) of a trade union, or for engaging in trade union activities\n\nReligious or political opinions\n\nLegal proceedings against an employer where you are a party or a witness\n\nRace, colour, sexual orientation, age, or membership of the Traveller community\n\nPregnancy, giving birth, breastfeeding, or any other matters connected with pregnancy or birth (such as attending antenatal classes)\n\nAvailing of rights under legislation to maternity leave, adoptive leave, paternity leave, carer\u2019s leave, parent\u2019s leave, parental leave or force majeure leave\n\nUnfair selection for redundancy\n\nMaking a protected disclosure (that is, where you raise concerns about possible wrongdoing at work) under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014\n\nUnfair dismissal happens where:\n\nYour employer ends your contract of employment, with or without notice\n\nYou end your contract of employment, with or without notice, due to the conduct of your employer. This is known as constructive dismissal.\n\nWhat does not count as \u2018unfair\u2019 dismissal?\n\nYour dismissal from work is not \u2018unfair\u2019 if it results from:\n\nYour capability, competence or qualifications for the job\n\nYour conduct (behaviour)\n\nYou being unable to work (or continue to work) in the position you held without breaking the law (for example, if your job involves driving and you are then legally disqualified from driving)\n\nYour redundancy (read more about redundancy below)\n\nIn general, redundancy is a fair reason for dismissal. However, you may have grounds (reasons) for complaint if you were unfairly selected for redundancy , or if you feel there was no genuine need for redundancy.\n\nUnless your employer can prove there was a genuine redundancy situation and that they followed fair procedures , your dismissal may be considered \u2018unfair\u2019.\n\nIf you make a claim for unfair dismissal, you cannot also claim redundancy.\n\nCan I bring a claim for unfair dismissal?Document 2:::\nYou are made redundant on carer\u2019s leave\n\nIf you are dismissed on grounds of redundancy, while on carer\u2019s leave , under the Carer\u2019s Leave Act 2001 it would be considered unfair dismissal.\n\nIf your employer does not allow you to return to work at the end of your carer\u2019s leave you may be able to bring a claim under the unfair dismissals legislation. However you may be made redundant after you have returned to work.\n\nI think I was unfairly selected or there wasn\u2019t a genuine redundancy\n\nsituation\n\nIf you feel that your employer has selected you unfairly, or that there was no genuine redundancy situation, you can bring a claim for unfair dismissal.\n\nYou think you were unfairly selected\n\nYour employer should use fair and reasonable selection criteria in choosing people to make redundant.\n\nExamples where your selection could be unfair include:\n\nWhere the custom and practice in your workplace has been last in, first out and your selection did not follow this procedure\n\nWhere your employment contract sets out criteria for selection which were not followed\n\nYour redundancy is unfair if your employer has discriminated in selecting you for redundancy. For example if they make you redundant because you\u2019re pregnant or on maternity leave.\n\nYour employer could also have chosen you for an unfair reason. Unfair reasons include making you redundant because you\u2019ve asked for one of your legal rights, made a health and safety complaint or been on an official strike.\n\nYou think there was no genuine redundancy situation\n\nA genuine redundancy is one where your employer has a real business reason to make you redundant.\n\nSigns your redundancy might not be a genuine include:\n\nYour employer has recently hired new employees to do similar work\n\nYou have a bad relationship with your employer or other people at work\n\nYou are singled out or treated differently from other people at work\n\nThe laws on redundancy\n\nThe laws on redundancy are set out in the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967\u20132014 .\n\nThe requirements to consult on collective redundancies are set out in the Protection of Employment Acts 1977-2024 as amended, and the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006.\n\nMore information\n\nYou can get more information about your employment rights from the WRC.

You need 104 weeks of continuous employment to qualify for redundancy.\n\nThe amount of redundancy pay you get is based on your reckonable service with your employer.

However, you may have grounds (reasons) for complaint if you were unfairly selected for redundancy , or if you feel there was no genuine need for redundancy.\n\nUnless your employer can prove there was a genuine redundancy situation and that they followed fair procedures , your dismissal may be considered \u2018unfair\u2019.\n\nIf you make a claim for unfair dismissal, you cannot also claim redundancy.\n\nCan I bring a claim for unfair dismissal?",

You then receive your naturalisation certificate.\n\nYou can read about what happens at a citizenship ceremony , and watch live streams of ceremonies on the ISD website.Document 4:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Moving Country > Visas and permission to enter Ireland\n\nVisas for tourists visiting Ireland\n\nVisas for tourists visiting Ireland\n\nWho needs a short-stay visa for Ireland?\n\nHow to apply for a short-stay visa\n\nDocuments to send for a short-stay visa\n\nDecisions and appeals\n\nCan I stay longer than 3 months?\n\nVisa fees\n\nFurther information\n\nWho needs a short-stay visa for Ireland?\n\nIf you plan to visit Ireland, you should check if you need a visa .\n\nThis page has information on how to apply for a short-stay visa. This is also called a \u2018C\u2019 visa and is usually valid for up to 90 days from the issue date of the visa. You apply for a C visa if you plan to come to Ireland:\n\nFor tourism\n\nTo visit family or friends\n\nTo get married\n\nFor medical treatment\n\nFor short-term study\n\nIf you are not a citizen of the EU, EEA, Switzerland or UK and you do not need a visa to come to Ireland, you still need to have documents with you to show the reason for your visit. You must present yourself at immigration when you enter Ireland.\n\nHaving a visa does not guarantee that you will be allowed to enter Ireland .\n\nHow to apply for a short-stay visa\n\nYou apply for a visa online. You complete a separate application for each person travelling, including children. After you have submitted the visa form, you have 30 days to send the supporting documents. It\u2019s a good idea to prepare your documents before completing the form.\n\nYou pay a fee of \u20ac60 for each application.

If you decide to use a solicitor, you may save money by getting quotes from a number of different law firms.\n\nDocumentation\n\nThe supporting documents you need depend on your situation. If your documents are in a language other than English, you must get them translated by a professional translating service. The Irish Translators\u2019 and Interpreters\u2019 Association has a list of professional translators.\n\nIn all cases, you will need to provide evidence of your identity and nationality.\n\nFrom 20 April 2023, new applicants are only required to provide a certified colour photocopy of the biometric page of their current passport. Your photocopy must be certified by a solicitor, commissioner for oaths, peace commissioner or a notary public. The ISD can still ask you to submit your full passport \u2013 it is expected that 10% of applicants will be asked to submit their full passport.\n\nScorecard system\n\nISD now uses a \u2018scorecard\u2019 system for assessing identification and residence history. This means that you can use a wider variety of documents, and be sure that you have enough evidence to send with your application.\n\nYou must have 150 points in both identification and residency. The Citizenship Guidance Document explains how many points you get for different types of documents.\n\nIf your application for naturalisation is based on your marriage or civil partnership with an Irish citizen , you will have to send documents that show your spouse\u2019s nationality and also evidence that you have been married for 3 years.\n\nSome of the documents you need to send must be certified as \u2018true copies\u2019 by a solicitor, notary, commissioner for oaths or a peace commissioner. You can ask a solicitor to certify your documents when you are making your statutory declaration (see Step 4 below). These include:\n\nYour birth certificate\n\nYour spouse\u2019s birth certificate (if your application is based on marriage to an Irish citizen)\n\nYour marriage certificate or civil partnership certificate (if your application is based on marriage to an Irish citizen)\n\nYour passport\n\nYou can find a full list of the documents you need to send when you apply.\n\nProblems with documents\n\nIf you are unable to include documents that are listed and you have tried to get copies of the documents but are unable to, you should explain the reason why you cannot include the documents.Document 6:::\nYou can read more about the documents you may need to send below.\n\nYou can read Frequently Asked Questions about the extended Passport Online service.\n\nApplying by post through Post Passport\n\nPost Passport is a service provided by An Post.\n\nIf your child is an Irish citizen living in Ireland , you should fill in form APS 1. You will find this form at Garda stations and any Post Office. It is not currently possible to download the paper application form.\n\nPhotographs\n\nYou must include 4 recent identical photographs of your child with your application. Two of these photographs should be signed on the back by the person who witnesses the application . The witness should also write the form number shown in Section 9 of the application form on the two signed photographs. If your child is 7 years old or above, your child must sign the form in the presence of the witness.\n\nMore detailed information on passport photographs is available .\n\nPost Passport abroad\n\nA number of UK Post Office branches in Northern Ireland provide the Post Passport service (pdf) .\n\nThe following post offices in the UK also offer Post Passport:\n\nCardiff Post Office, 83 - 85 Queen Street, Cardiff, CF10 2NX\n\nGlasgow Post Office, 140 West Nile Street, Glasgow, G1 2RD\n\nLiverpool Post Office, 1 \u2013 3 South John Street, Liverpool, L1 8BN\n\nIf you are applying abroad, suitable categories of witnesses are listed on the application form. The witness should enter their daytime contact number on the application form as this may need to be verified by the Passport Service or the relevant embassy or consulate.\n\nApplying in person\n\nApplying in person to the Passport Office for your child\u2019s first passport is not recommended. Nearly all Irish citizens, including children, can apply for their first passport online.\n\nThe counter service in the Passport Office is designed to accommodate people who need to renew their passports urgently , and don\u2019t have enough time to apply in other ways. It should not be used for first time applications. These applications are too complex to process at the public counter because your right to Irish citizenship must be established and your documents must be verified. You should not book any travel until you have received your child\u2019s passport as these applications cannot be expedited.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: How long will my passport application take?\nA:\n\n* Simple online renewals take around 10 working days to process.\n* Complex online renewals take around 15 working days to process. A complex renewal is when you are asked to submit extra documentation or you are changing information on your passport. You could be changing your name or reporting a lost or stolen passport.\n* If you are applying by post, you should allow at least 8 weeks for your application to be processed (not including postage times). This period may be extended at certain times of the year due to increased application numbers.\n* Check the Passport Service website for current processing times.",

It's treated as if you never left, so your service is still counted as continuous.\n\nDo I need a medical cert to get sick pay?\n\nUnder the sick leave legislation, you must be certified by a medical practitioner as unable to work to qualify for statutory sick pay. You should be certified from day 1 of your sick leave.\n\nYou have a right to SSP from the first day you are off sick.

It only needs to be a statement of fact that the person is, or was, in need of significant care or support for a serious medical reason.\n\nDo I need to give notice?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to give your employer notice to take the leave in emergency circumstances.\n\nYou should give notice if it\u2019s possible to.\n\nHow to apply\n\nYou must give confirmation to your employer in writing that you want to apply for (or have already taken) the leave. You should do this as soon as reasonably practical. You must also sign this confirmation.\n\nYour signed confirmation must contain:\n\nThe start date\n\nLength of the leave\n\nA statement of fact (explaining why you are entitled to the leave).\n\nYour employer must keep the confirmation document and give you a written acknowledgment that they received the confirmation.\n\nWhat information do I need to give?\n\nYour employer can request information relating to:\n\nYour relationship with the person being cared for\n\nThe nature of that care\n\nRelevant evidence stating that the person named is, or was, in need of significant care or support for a serious medical reason\n\nSee \u2018What serious medical care is covered?\u2019 above for more information about what counts as relevant evidence .\n\nProtection of your employment rights\n\nIn general, you will be treated as if you are in work during leave for medical care.

Your employer cannot penalise or treat you unfairly by, for example, giving you worse conditions of employment or selecting you for redundancy.\n\nIf I take leave for medical care while on probation\n\nYour employer can suspend your probation, training or apprenticeship for the period you are on leave for medical care. The days can be added onto the end of your probation, training or apprenticeship period.Document 6:::\nYou cannot use this method if you changed employment during the leave year.\n\nMethod 2\n\nCalculate 1/3 of a working week for each calendar month in which you worked at least 117 hours.\n\nMethod 3\n\nCalculate 8% of the hours you worked in the leave year, subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks.\n\nWhen calculating your holiday entitlement, your employer should include all the hours you worked, including time spent on annual leave, maternity leave, parental leave, force majeure leave, adoptive leave or the first 13 weeks of carer\u2019s leave.\n\nIf you have worked for at least 8 months, you are entitled to an unbroken period of 2 weeks' annual leave. This means you can get 2 weeks off in a row.\n\nHoliday pay\n\nHoliday pay (pay for annual leave) must be paid in advance at your normal weekly rate .\n\nIf your pay changes from week-to-week (for example, because of commission or bonus payments), your holiday pay is the average of your pay over the 13 weeks before you take holidays.\n\nPart-time employees\n\nGenerally, annual leave for part-time workers is calculated using Method 3 above. This means you can get 8% of your hours worked.\n\nIf you work full time for some months and part-time for the rest of the year, you should calculate the leave for the full-time and the part-time periods of work separately.\n\nAgency employees\n\nIf you are an agency worker, the party who pays your wages (employment agency or client company) is the employer for the purposes of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 , and is responsible for providing your annual leave entitlement.\n\nCan my employer force me to take annual leave?\n\nUsually, employees can ask to take annual leave at specific times. Your employer can accept your request, or refuse your request.\n\nYour employer decides when annual leave may be taken, but this is subject to a number of conditions. Your employer must:\n\nTake into account your family responsibilities, as well as the available opportunities for rest and recreation.\n\nDiscuss your annual leave with you (or your union) at least one month before you are to take the leave.\n\nCan I \u2018carry over\u2019 annual leave to next year?\n\nAnnual leave should be taken within the leave year (see above). Depending on your employer, you can agree to take your annual leave within 6 months of the relevant leave year.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What if I get sick while on annual leave?\nA:\nIf you get sick while on annual leave and get a medical certificate for those days, they will not be counted as annual leave days.

They must also give you a minimum amount of notice, depending on how long your tenancy has lasted. These rules apply to private landlords, approved housing bodies and people who let student-specific accommodation.\n\nTerminating a tenancy\n\nIf your landlord wants you to leave your accommodation, they must serve you with a written notice of termination and give you the correct amount of notice .\n\nIf your tenancy has lasted less than 6 months your landlord can ask you to leave without giving you a reason. If your tenancy has lasted more than 6 months your landlord must give you a valid reason why they are terminating the tenancy .\n\nFixed-term tenancies\n\nIf you have a fixed-term tenancy, your landlord cannot end the tenancy before the end of the fixed term unless you breach your obligations . A fixed-term tenancy is an agreement that covers a specific amount of time. It is generally set down in a written contract, called a lease. It may be for any period, but can range from 6 months up to a year or more.\n\nWhat is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\n\nGenerally, your landlord can only end a tenancy after the first 6 months if:\n\nYou do not comply with the obligations of the tenancy , for example, by not paying your rent on time\n\nThe property is no longer suited to your needs, for example, if it is too small\n\nThe landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months. However, this may not apply if the landlord plans to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period \u2013 see \u2018Restriction on terminating when selling multiple properties\u2019 belowDocument 1:::\nRead more about leases on the website of Threshold, the national housing charity.\n\nPeriodic tenancy\n\nA periodic tenancy agreement does not specify a fixed length of time. The period of the tenancy may be weekly or monthly, depending on how often the rent is due. Periodic tenancy agreements may or may not be in writing.\n\nYour landlord can end the tenancy at any time during the first 6 months of the tenancy without having to give a reason, but, in general, you will get security of tenure after 6 months \u2013 see \u2018Part 4 tenancy\u2019 below. You must always get a valid written notice of termination and there are rules about how much notice you must be given, depending on the length of the tenancy (with some exceptions). Read more in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\n\nAs a tenant, you can end the periodic tenancy at any time. You do not have to give a reason. Again, there are rules about notice periods and what constitutes a valid notice of termination \u2013 see \u2018Ending your tenancy\u2019 below.\n\nClaiming a Part 4 tenancy at the end of a fixed-term lease\n\nIf you have a fixed-term contract or lease and you want to remain in the property under a Part 4 tenancy, you should notify your landlord of your intention to stay in the property. You should do this between 3 months and 1 month before your fixed\u2013term tenancy or lease agreement expires.\n\nIf you do not notify your landlord, you cannot be refused coverage under Part 4, but you may have to compensate the landlord for any financial loss that they have because you did not notify them of your intention to remain in the tenancy.\n\nEnding your tenancy\n\nThe following section outlines what a tenant must do to end a tenancy. There are different rules for landlords who want to end a tenancy . The RTB also has information on their website about how a tenant can end a tenancy .\n\nFormat of termination notice\n\nAs a tenant, you can terminate your tenancy (whether fixed-term or periodic) without giving a reason, but you must give a valid notice of termination to your landlord. In order to be valid, this notice must:\n\nBe in writing\n\nBe signed by you\n\nSpecify the date that you are serving it on the landlord\n\nSpecify the termination date of the tenancy (you have the full 24 hours of this date to vacate possession)Document 2:::\nYou do not have security of tenure . This came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (pdf) .\n\nYou cannot be forced to pay for student-specific accommodation during the summer when you don\u2019t need it. Your tenancy or licence arrangement should not be more than 41 weeks, unless you ask for longer. If your landlord does not comply with the 41-week rule you should contact to the RTB, who can sanction your landlord. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024.\n\nYou only need to give your landlord 28 days\u2019 notice when ending a tenancy. You can give your landlord more notice if you want and your landlord must give you more. This came in under the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 .\n\nYou can terminate your fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and you can only terminate your tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 .\n\nFind out more about your rights as a tenant in student-specific accommodation on the RTB\u2019s website .\n\nSecurity of tenure\n\nSecurity of tenure is a tenant\u2019s right to stay in rented accommodation for a set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when you have been renting for 6 months and haven\u2019t received a valid notice of termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons, see our page \u2018 If your landlord wants you to leave \u2019.\n\nThe amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began.\n\nIf your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022 , you have a tenancy of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months, you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date), unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed reasons.Document 3:::\nIf this is not done, the notice of termination is invalid. The RTB recommends that landlords use certified post when posting the notice of termination to the tenant and the RTB, and that they keep proof of this.\n\nWhen the RTB receives the notice of termination it will:\n\nWrite to you and your landlord about the RTB services and outline your rights and responsibilities under residential tenancies legislation\n\nAsk for your contact details in case the landlord needs them to offer the property back to you. This will only be done with your consent\n\nThis requirement is in place since 6 July 2022, when it was brought in under the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022.\n\nThe RTB's website has more information about these changes .\n\nWhat is a valid notice of termination?\n\nThe law sets out the requirements for a valid notice of termination. It must:\n\nBe in writing (an email is not sufficient)\n\nBe signed by the landlord (or an authorised agent)\n\nSpecify the date of termination of the tenancy\n\nState that you have the whole 24 hours of the termination date to vacate the property\n\nSpecify the date of the notice itself\n\nState the reason for termination, if a tenancy has lasted more than 6 months or is a fixed-term tenancy. (This does not have to be included for tenancies in student-specific accommodation.)\n\nState that any issue about the validity of the notice or the right of the landlord to serve it must be referred to the RTB within 90 days from the receipt of the notice. (This 90-day timeframe applies unless the tenant is in breach of their obligations.)\n\nYour landlord must give additional details in certain situations and, in some cases, a statutory declaration. The information below describes the additional details needed for each of the valid reasons for terminating your tenancy. The RTB also provides sample notices of termination , with the details required in each situation.\n\nIf the property is being sold\n\nIf your landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months of the terminating your tenancy, the notice of termination must state that:\n\n\u201cThe reason for the termination of the tenancy is due to the fact that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, for full consideration, within 9 months after the termination of the tenancy\u201d.Document 4:::\nThey must do this if they ended your tenancy because they:\n\nPlanned to sell the property within 9 months\n\nNeeded the property for their own use or for an immediate family member\n\nPlanned to change the use of the property\n\nPlanned to refurbish the property substantially\n\nYour landlord must make every reasonable effort to get your contact details, so they can offer the property back to you. This includes contacting the RTB to ask for them. The RTB may have your contact details to give to the landlord or they may contact you to get them. The RTB will only pass your details to the landlord if you have given your consent to do this.\n\nWhen your landlord contacts you to offer to re-let the property to you, you have 7 days to accept or reject this offer.\n\nThe RTB website has a step-by-step guide to this procedure .\n\nRestriction on terminating tenancies when selling multiple properties\n\nA landlord cannot terminate a tenancy of more than 6 months if they intend to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period, unless:\n\nThey can show that the market value with a sitting tenant is over 20% below the market value with vacant possession, and\n\nPreventing them from terminating the tenancy would be unduly onerous on them or would cause them undue hardship\n\nThis provision is often called the \u2018Tyrrelstown\u2019 amendment and it is provided for under Section 40 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 .\n\nNotice of termination\n\nIf your landlord wants you to leave, they must serve you with a valid written notice of termination. The notice can be posted to you, be given to you in person or be left for you at your address. Emails and text messages do not qualify as valid notices of termination. If it appears that you are not living in the property, the landlord can affix the notice to the outside of the property.\n\nYour landlord must also send a copy of the notice of termination to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). This must be done at the same time as it is sent to you. It can be emailed to NoticeofTermination@rtb.ie or posted to the RTB along with the RTB Notice of Termination Return Form (pdf) .Document 5:::\nTenants in student-specific accommodation do not have security of tenure\n\nLandlords may be able to access communal areas without the permission of the tenants\n\nTenancy or licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation should not be more than 41 weeks, This is so students do not have to pay for accommodation during the summer when you don\u2019t need it. The RTB can sanction you, if you do not comply with the 41-week rule, This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024.\n\nTenants in student-specific accommodation only need to give you 28 days\u2019 notice when they end their tenancy. This came in under the Residential Tenancies (No.2) Act 2021 . You must give them more notice when ending their tenancy .\n\nYour tenant can terminate a fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and they can only end the tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 .\n\nFind out more about student-specific accommodation on the RTB\u2019s website .\n\nYour rights as a landlord\n\nYou have the right to:\n\nSet the rent\n\nGet the correct rent on the date it is due\n\nGet any charges associated with the property (this means taxes and duties or payments)\n\nTerminate a tenancy during the first 6 months without giving a reason\n\nIn certain circumstances \u2013 terminate a tenancy at a later stage\n\nBe informed about who is ordinarily living in the property (this does not include overnight visitors or short stays)\n\nBe informed about any repairs needed\n\nBe given reasonable access to the property to carry out repairs\n\nCarry out routine inspections at a mutually agreed time\n\nRefer disputes to the RTB \u2013 but only if you have registered the tenancy\n\nReview the rent. There are rules about how often you can review the rent in a private tenancy. These timeframes depend on when the tenancy started and if the property is in a Rent Pressure Zone or not. AHB rents are reviewed every 12 months, or according to the tenancy agreement.Document 6:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Housing > Local authority and social housing > Your rights as an approved housing body tenant\n\nYour rights as an approved housing body tenant\n\nWhat are my rights if I am renting from an approved housing body?\n\nHow are my rights different to a tenant in private rented housing?\n\nWho do I contact if I have an issue?\n\nWhat are my rights if I am renting from an approved housing body?\n\nIf you are a tenant of an approved housing body or other voluntary housing organisation, your tenancy is covered by residential tenancies legislation. This means that you have most of the same rights and responsibilities as a tenant in private rented housing. For example:\n\nYour landlord (the AHB) must register your tenancy every year with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB)\n\nIf you have problems with your tenancy, you or your landlord (or a neighbour affected by the problems) can use the RTB\u2019s dispute resolution service\n\nApproved housing bodies came under the scope of residential tenancies legislation on 7 April 2016, when the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 came into effect.\n\nHow are my rights different to a tenant in private rented housing?\n\nIf you are a tenant of an AHB, you have most of the same rights and responsibilities as a tenant in private rented housing, with some exceptions, which are:\n\nThe minimum standards for food preparation, storage and laundry purposes do not apply to AHBs. This means that AHBs do not have to provide you with white goods, such as washing machines.\n\nRent reviews should be carried out in accordance with your tenancy agreement (if there is one) or else no more than once a year. There is no specific notice period for a rent review, but you must be given notice as soon as is practicable.\n\nYou may not assign or sublet your AHB tenancy\n\nMost AHB tenants will get security of tenure after 6 months. Though, this does not apply if you are living in transitional accommodation and the tenancy is for 18 months or less.\n\nYour AHB can validly end your tenancy as long as they meet all the legal requirements. But, they cannot terminate a Part 4 tenancy because they need the property for their own or a family member's use.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\nA:\n\nGenerally, your landlord can only end a tenancy after the first 6 months if:\n\n* You do not comply with the obligations of the tenancy, for example, by not paying your rent on time\n* The property is no longer suited to your needs, for example, if it is too small\n* The landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months.

These rules apply to private landlords, approved housing bodies and people who let student-specific accommodation.\n\nTerminating a tenancy\n\nIf your landlord wants you to leave your accommodation, they must serve you with a written notice of termination and give you the correct amount of notice .\n\nIf your tenancy has lasted less than 6 months your landlord can ask you to leave without giving you a reason. If your tenancy has lasted more than 6 months your landlord must give you a valid reason why they are terminating the tenancy .\n\nFixed-term tenancies\n\nIf you have a fixed-term tenancy, your landlord cannot end the tenancy before the end of the fixed term unless you breach your obligations . A fixed-term tenancy is an agreement that covers a specific amount of time. It is generally set down in a written contract, called a lease. It may be for any period, but can range from 6 months up to a year or more.\n\nWhat is a valid reason for ending a tenancy after the first 6 months?\n\nGenerally, your landlord can only end a tenancy after the first 6 months if:\n\nYou do not comply with the obligations of the tenancy , for example, by not paying your rent on time\n\nThe property is no longer suited to your needs, for example, if it is too small\n\nThe landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months. However, this may not apply if the landlord plans to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period \u2013 see \u2018Restriction on terminating when selling multiple properties\u2019 below",
                    "Read more about leases on the website of Threshold, the national housing charity.\n\nPeriodic tenancy\n\nA periodic tenancy agreement does not specify a fixed length of time. The period of the tenancy may be weekly or monthly, depending on how often the rent is due. Periodic tenancy agreements may or may not be in writing.\n\nYour landlord can end the tenancy at any time during the first 6 months of the tenancy without having to give a reason, but, in general, you will get security of tenure after 6 months \u2013 see \u2018Part 4 tenancy\u2019 below. You must always get a valid written notice of termination and there are rules about how much notice you must be given, depending on the length of the tenancy (with some exceptions). Read more in our page If your landlord wants you to leave .\n\nAs a tenant, you can end the periodic tenancy at any time. You do not have to give a reason. Again, there are rules about notice periods and what constitutes a valid notice of termination \u2013 see \u2018Ending your tenancy\u2019 below.\n\nClaiming a Part 4 tenancy at the end of a fixed-term lease\n\nIf you have a fixed-term contract or lease and you want to remain in the property under a Part 4 tenancy, you should notify your landlord of your intention to stay in the property. You should do this between 3 months and 1 month before your fixed\u2013term tenancy or lease agreement expires.\n\nIf you do not notify your landlord, you cannot be refused coverage under Part 4, but you may have to compensate the landlord for any financial loss that they have because you did not notify them of your intention to remain in the tenancy.\n\nEnding your tenancy\n\nThe following section outlines what a tenant must do to end a tenancy. There are different rules for landlords who want to end a tenancy . The RTB also has information on their website about how a tenant can end a tenancy .\n\nFormat of termination notice\n\nAs a tenant, you can terminate your tenancy (whether fixed-term or periodic) without giving a reason, but you must give a valid notice of termination to your landlord. In order to be valid, this notice must:\n\nBe in writing\n\nBe signed by you\n\nSpecify the date that you are serving it on the landlord\n\nSpecify the termination date of the tenancy (you have the full 24 hours of this date to vacate possession)",
                    "You do not have security of tenure . This came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 (pdf) .\n\nYou cannot be forced to pay for student-specific accommodation during the summer when you don\u2019t need it. Your tenancy or licence arrangement should not be more than 41 weeks, unless you ask for longer. If your landlord does not comply with the 41-week rule you should contact to the RTB, who can sanction your landlord. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 and applies to tenancies and licence arrangements in student-specific accommodation created from 20 July 2024.\n\nYou only need to give your landlord 28 days\u2019 notice when ending a tenancy. You can give your landlord more notice if you want and your landlord must give you more. This came in under the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 .\n\nYou can terminate your fixed-term tenancy any time between 1 May and 1 October each year for any reason. But, outside of these dates, the existing rules about ending a fixed-term tenancy apply and you can only terminate your tenancy for specific reasons. This rule came in under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2024 .\n\nFind out more about your rights as a tenant in student-specific accommodation on the RTB\u2019s website .\n\nSecurity of tenure\n\nSecurity of tenure is a tenant\u2019s right to stay in rented accommodation for a set amount of time. Generally, security of tenure applies automatically when you have been renting for 6 months and haven\u2019t received a valid notice of termination from your landlord in that time. When you have security of tenure, your landlord can only terminate your tenancy for a limited number of reasons, see our page \u2018 If your landlord wants you to leave \u2019.\n\nThe amount of time you are entitled to stay in rented accommodation after the first 6 months depends on when your tenancy began.\n\nIf your tenancy was created after 10 June 2022 , you have a tenancy of unlimited duration. This means if you have rented somewhere for 6 months, you have the right to stay in that accommodation indefinitely (no end date), unless the landlord wants to terminate your tenancy for one of the allowed reasons.",
                    "If this is not done, the notice of termination is invalid. The RTB recommends that landlords use certified post when posting the notice of termination to the tenant and the RTB, and that they keep proof of this.\n\nWhen the RTB receives the notice of termination it will:\n\nWrite to you and your landlord about the RTB services and outline your rights and responsibilities under residential tenancies legislation\n\nAsk for your contact details in case the landlord needs them to offer the property back to you. This will only be done with your consent\n\nThis requirement is in place since 6 July 2022, when it was brought in under the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022.\n\nThe RTB's website has more information about these changes .\n\nWhat is a valid notice of termination?\n\nThe law sets out the requirements for a valid notice of termination. It must:\n\nBe in writing (an email is not sufficient)\n\nBe signed by the landlord (or an authorised agent)\n\nSpecify the date of termination of the tenancy\n\nState that you have the whole 24 hours of the termination date to vacate the property\n\nSpecify the date of the notice itself\n\nState the reason for termination, if a tenancy has lasted more than 6 months or is a fixed-term tenancy. (This does not have to be included for tenancies in student-specific accommodation.)\n\nState that any issue about the validity of the notice or the right of the landlord to serve it must be referred to the RTB within 90 days from the receipt of the notice. (This 90-day timeframe applies unless the tenant is in breach of their obligations.)\n\nYour landlord must give additional details in certain situations and, in some cases, a statutory declaration. The information below describes the additional details needed for each of the valid reasons for terminating your tenancy. The RTB also provides sample notices of termination , with the details required in each situation.\n\nIf the property is being sold\n\nIf your landlord intends to sell the property within 9 months of the terminating your tenancy, the notice of termination must state that:\n\n\u201cThe reason for the termination of the tenancy is due to the fact that the landlord intends to sell the dwelling, for full consideration, within 9 months after the termination of the tenancy\u201d.",
                    "They must do this if they ended your tenancy because they:\n\nPlanned to sell the property within 9 months\n\nNeeded the property for their own use or for an immediate family member\n\nPlanned to change the use of the property\n\nPlanned to refurbish the property substantially\n\nYour landlord must make every reasonable effort to get your contact details, so they can offer the property back to you. This includes contacting the RTB to ask for them. The RTB may have your contact details to give to the landlord or they may contact you to get them. The RTB will only pass your details to the landlord if you have given your consent to do this.\n\nWhen your landlord contacts you to offer to re-let the property to you, you have 7 days to accept or reject this offer.\n\nThe RTB website has a step-by-step guide to this procedure .\n\nRestriction on terminating tenancies when selling multiple properties\n\nA landlord cannot terminate a tenancy of more than 6 months if they intend to sell 10 or more dwellings in a development within a 6-month period, unless:\n\nThey can show that the market value with a sitting tenant is over 20% below the market value with vacant possession, and\n\nPreventing them from terminating the tenancy would be unduly onerous on them or would cause them undue hardship\n\nThis provision is often called the \u2018Tyrrelstown\u2019 amendment and it is provided for under Section 40 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 .\n\nNotice of termination\n\nIf your landlord wants you to leave, they must serve you with a valid written notice of termination. The notice can be posted to you, be given to you in person or be left for you at your address. Emails and text messages do not qualify as valid notices of termination. If it appears that you are not living in the property, the landlord can affix the notice to the outside of the property.\n\nYour landlord must also send a copy of the notice of termination to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). This must be done at the same time as it is sent to you. It can be emailed to NoticeofTermination@rtb.ie or posted to the RTB along with the RTB Notice of Termination Return Form (pdf) ."

Here we use the term \u2018service supplier\u2019 to mean any person who supplies a service as a business or part of a business.\n\nThis page explains your consumer rights if you bought a service on or before 28 November 2022.\n\nYou have different rights if you bought on or after 29 November 2022. This is because the Consumer Rights Act 2022 (pdf) introduced new rights when you buy services .\n\nYour rights as a consumer\n\nWhen you hire someone to perform a service, you are making a contract. As parties to the contract, you and the other party have certain legal rights and obligations. If the person you hired does not do what they said they would under a contract, they are in breach of the contract.\n\nConsumer contracts in place before 1 November 2022 are protected by the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.\n\nIf you have a contract with a service supplier you can expect that:\n\nThe supplier has the necessary skill to provide the service\n\nThe service will be provided with proper care and diligence\n\nThe materials used will be sound\n\nAny goods supplied with the service will be of merchantable quality\n\nIn a service contract, at the very least, make sure that you know the price of the service and the time that it will take to complete the agreed work.\n\nDo you have a written contract?\n\nContracts can be written or verbal and are made up of terms; some of which can be implied terms . Implied terms are not mentioned but are automatically part of a contract because of protections under consumer legislation.\n\nContracts differ in many ways and there are no hard and fast rules for what terms should be in a consumer contract. However, terms in consumer contracts must always be fair and made clear to you.Document 6:::\nWhen you are reporting a crime, making a statement and being interviewed, you have the right to bring a person of your choice with you for support. You can also have a legal representative (solicitor) with you.\n\nHowever, the Garda\u00ed can ask you to pick a different support person or legal representative if they think this is in your best interest, or if they think the person you picked could interfere with the investigation.\n\nAfter you have reported a crime, you have the right to get a written acknowledgment of what you have reported. You will usually have the right to a copy of any statement that you made to the Garda\u00ed. You can get this by asking the local Garda Victim Service Office .\n\nEven if you don\u2019t report the crime, you are entitled to access support services for victims of crime and to get information about these services.\n\nWhat if I am a victim of crime abroad?\n\nIf you are a victim of crime while visiting another country, you should contact a local Irish embassy or consulate for support . Depending on the nature of the crime , you should also contact the local police. A local Irish embassy or consulate can assist you in dealing with the local police if necessary.\n\nIf you have since returned to Ireland, you can report the crime to An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na who will forward this to the appropriate police service.\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs has further information on the role of embassies and consulates in supporting victims of crime abroad.\n\nWhat are my rights while the crime is being investigated?\n\nAs part of the investigation, you may need to be interviewed and, depending on the nature of the crime, medically examined. Any necessary interviews and examinations should be kept to a minimum.\n\nYou can request information about significant developments in the investigation, such as the arresting and charging of a suspect, and the Garda\u00ed are obliged to provide this information.\n\nHowever, you are not entitled to get any information that could:\n\nInterfere with the investigation\n\nEndanger another person, or the security of the State\n\nPrejudice ongoing or future criminal proceedings\n\nIf any property is taken from you as part of the investigation, you should get it back without delay, if possible. However, if it has to be used as evidence in a criminal trial , you might not get it back until the court case is finished.\n\nWhat are my rights if the investigation is stopped, or nobody is\n\nprosecuted?\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What are your rights when an order is delayed or not delivered?\nA:\n\n* You have the right to be informed about the delivery time and any changes to this time.\n* If the goods are not delivered within 30 days of the agreed delivery date, you can cancel the contract and get a full refund.\n* If the goods are not delivered within 30 days of the agreed delivery date and you do not want to cancel the contract, you can claim compensation for the delay.\n* If the goods are not delivered within 30 days of the agreed delivery date and you have not been informed about the delay, you can claim compensation for the delay.\n* If the goods are not delivered within 30 days of the agreed delivery date and you have not been informed about the delay, you can cancel the contract and get a full refund.\n* If the goods are not delivered within 30 days of the agreed delivery date and you have not been informed about the delay, you can claim compensation for the delay and cancel the contract.\n* If the goods are not delivered within 30 days of the agreed delivery date and you have not been informed about the delay, you can claim compensation for the delay and keep the goods.\n* If the goods are not delivered within 30 days of the agreed delivery date and you have not been informed about the delay, you can claim compensation for the delay and keep the goods and cancel the contract.\n* If the goods are not delivered within 30 days of the agreed delivery date and you have not been informed about the delay, you can claim compensation for the delay and keep the goods and not cancel the contract.",

There are different types of domestic adoption, for example, step-parent adoption and long-term foster care adoption .\n\nThis page explains the different types of domestic adoption, the steps involved in the adoption process, and the rules about who can adopt a child in Ireland.\n\nYou may also want to read our page about intercountry adoption , which is where you adopt a child from abroad.\n\nTypes of domestic adoption\n\nDomestic adoption is when you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland. There are different types of domestic adoption:\n\nStep-parent adoption\n\nStep-parent adoption is where you apply to adopt your partner\u2019s child.\n\nYour partner can consent (agree) to the adoption and still keep their own parental rights and responsibilities. In a step-parent adoption, you and your partner share parenting duties once the adoption order is made. Read about adoption orders in the section \u2018Steps involved in adopting a child\u2019, below.\n\nThe child must have lived with their parent and you (the prospective step- parent) together, for a minimum of 2 years .\n\nExtended family adoption\n\nAn extended family adoption is where a member of the child\u2019s family (or a relative), adopts the child. The child would have been placed with them by the birth mother or by the Tusla childcare system.\n\nDomestic infant adoption\n\nDomestic infant adoption is where a child is placed with an alternative set of parents. The child is placed with the couple by the Tusla adoption service or an accredited adoption agency. The Adoption Authority of Ireland must approve the placement before it takes place.\n\nLong term foster care adoption\n\nFoster care adoption is when a couple adopt a child who was originally placed with them in a foster care situation.\n\nFind more information on the different types of domestic adoption on the Adoption Authority of Ireland\u2019s website.\n\nWho can adopt a child in Ireland?Document 1:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Family and Relationships > Adoption, fostering and surrogacy > Intercountry adoption\n\nIntercountry adoption\n\nWhat is intercountry adoption?\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nBeing assessed for eligibility to adopt\n\nChoosing a country to adopt from\n\nThe process of intercountry adoption\n\nGetting immigration clearance for the child\n\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\n\nMore information about intercountry adoption\n\nWhat is intercountry adoption?\n\nIf you adopt a child who lives in a country outside Ireland, the process is called intercountry adoption. If you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland, it is called domestic adoption .\n\nWhen you adopt a child, they become a member of your family. Adoption creates a legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the child.\n\nAs intercountry adoption is a complex legal process, you should get legal advice from a solicitor who specialises in intercountry adoption. See 'More information about intercountry adoption' below.\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nYou must be at least 21 years of age to adopt a child under Irish law. There is no Irish legal upper age limit for adopting parents but age is a factor in determining suitability here.\n\nYou must also:\n\nHave a valid 'declaration of eligibility and suitability' (see 'Being assessed for eligibility to adopt' below)\n\nBe \u2018habitually resident in the State\u2019, which means Ireland has become your home. Living in Ireland for at least one year before the date of the making of the adoption order would generally be sufficient.\n\nYour relationship status does not necessarily impact your eligibility to adopt a child. This means you are eligible to adopt if you are:\n\nA married couple\n\nA couple living together in a civil partnership\n\nA couple cohabiting together in a relationship for at least 3 years (living together but not married or in a civil partnership)\n\nA sole applicant who is not in one of the categories listed above (only where the Adoption Authority is satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is desirable and in the best interests of the child)\n\nYou may also be eligible to adopt if you are the mother, father or relative of the child. \u2018Relative\u2019 means a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the child (or the spouse of any such person), with the relationship to the child being traced through either the mother or the father.Document 2:::\nTo request an Immigration Clearance Letter, you need to write to:\n\nForeign Adoptions Unit\n\nUnit 3 Domestic Residence & Permissions Division\n\n4th floor\n\nImmigration Service Delivery\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\n13-14 Burgh Quay\n\nDublin 2\n\nD02 XK70\n\nYou must include:\n\nA letter of application, with a daytime contact number\n\nA photocopy of the passport of each adopter\n\nTwo passport size photographs of each adopter\n\nThe original Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability (not a copy)\n\nA letter from the Adoption Authority stating how many children you are eligible to adopt and from what country\n\nThese documents will be returned to you with your Immigration Clearance Letter, when approved. You will need to show this letter to an immigration officer when you return to Ireland.\n\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\n\nTell the Adoption Authority that the child has arrived\n\nYou must tell the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla when you bring the child to Ireland for the first time after adoption in the country of origin. Find contact details in the section \u2018More information about intercountry adoption\u2019 below.\n\nYou must also tell the Adoption Authority and Tusla if you have brought the child to Ireland, in order to adopt the child through domestic adoption .\n\nYou must do this within 3 months of the child arriving in Ireland.\n\nRegister the adoption in Ireland\n\nIf the child was adopted in the country of origin, the final step in the intercountry adoption process is the registration of the adoption. This is the formal, legal recognition of the adoption by the Irish State.\n\nYou must complete and submit an application for registration of the adoption (pdf) to the Adoption Authority within 3 months of re-entering Ireland following the adoption.\n\nThe Adoption Authority can register the adoption in the \u2018Register of Intercountry Adoptions\u2019, on the basis of an \u2018Article 23 certificate\u2019. An Article 23 certificate is a certificate of assurance from the child\u2019s country of origin that proves the adoption was carried out in compliance with the Hague Convention.\n\nGetting an adoption certificate\n\nWhen the adoption has been registered, it will appear on the Register of Intercountry Adoptions. The register has details of the adopted child and the adoptive parents. It is a public register and is open to scrutiny by members of the public.Document 3:::\nYou are granted a \u2018Declaration to Adopt\u2019\n\nThe Adoption Authority of Ireland is sent:\n\nYour application for assessment\n\nThe social worker\u2019s report\n\nThe local adoption committee\u2019s recommendations\n\nIf all documents are in place and correct, the Adoption Authority of Ireland will consider the recommendations and decide whether to grant a Declaration to Adopt (sometimes called a \u2018Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability\u2019). The declaration is like a \u2018license to adopt\u2019, and may include the age and health status of a child whom you are considered suitable to parent (based on the information in the assessment report).\n\nThe Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability is granted for a period of 2 years from the date it is issued . If your declaration is about to expire, you can apply to have it extended by a further 1 year , provided there have been no changes in your circumstances.\n\nIf your circumstances have changed (for example, you moved home or your health status has changed), you must tell the Adoption Authority of Ireland in writing . Read more about what to do if your situation has changed under the heading \u2018Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability\u2019 on the Adoption Authority\u2019s website.\n\nThe \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 are considered\n\nThe Adoption Authority of Ireland always puts the best interests of the child first. The Authority will consider:\n\nThe child\u2019s age and maturity\n\nThe physical, psychological and emotional needs of the child\n\nThe likely effect of adoption on the child\n\nThe child\u2019s views on their proposed adoption\n\nThe child\u2019s social, intellectual and educational needs\n\nThe child\u2019s upbringing and care\n\nThe child\u2019s relationship with their parent, guardian or relative as the case may be\n\nAny other circumstances affecting the child\n\nAn adoption order is made\n\nAn adoption order is a legal document, issued by the Adoption Authority of Ireland. It confirms that the child is, by law, a member of their new family. When an adoption order is issued, the child is legally regarded as the child of the adoptive parents, as if they were born to them.\n\nThe period of time between the granting of the declaration of eligibility and suitability to the making of an adoption order differs from one case to another depending on the type of adoption application being made and the particular circumstances of the applicants and the child.\n\nIn the case of a step-parent adoption where the child is in situ, it is expected that the application for the adoption order will progress during the lifespan of the declaration of eligibility and suitability.Document 4:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Family and Relationships > Adoption, fostering and surrogacy\n\nAdoption, fostering and surrogacy\n\nDomestic adoption\n\nAn outline of the adoption process in Ireland.\n\nIntercountry adoption\n\nThe process of adopting a child from abroad, and the requirements (eligibility criteria) you must meet in order to carry out an intercountry adoption.\n\nFostering\n\nThere are currently more than 5,500 children in care in Ireland. Find out about fostering in Ireland and how you can become involved.\n\nSurrogacy in Ireland\n\nSurrogacy is a way for a couple or individual to have a child, with a 'surrogate mother' carrying the child for them. Find out more about the law on surrogacy in Ireland and abroad.\n\nTracing your birth information and birth family\n\nFind out how to access your birth information or trace your birth family if you were adopted in Ireland.\n\nMother and baby and county home institutions\n\nThis page describes the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, and the main actions set out by Government to address the needs of the people who spent time in mother and baby and county home institutions.\n\nMother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme\n\nInformation on the application process for the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme.\n\nKinship care\n\nKinship care is the full-time parenting of children by grandparents, relatives, or close friends when their parents are no longer able to look after them.\n\nAdoptive Benefit\n\nAdoptive Benefit is a payment made to people on adoptive leave from work. Find out how to apply and rates of benefit.\n\nThis document is in: Families and children\n\nAdoptive leave\n\nAdoptive leave gives one parent who adopts a child, 24 weeks\u2019 leave from work after the child is placed in your care.\n\nThis document is in: Leave and holidays\n\nMost Read in \"Adoption, fostering and surrogacy\"\n\nFostering\n\nMother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme\n\nDomestic adoption\n\nSurrogacy in Ireland\n\nIntercountry adoptionDocument 5:::\nThe birth mother (or guardian) has a right to know the religion of the prospective adoptive parents before they give consent.\n\nThe birth father\n\nIf the birth father is not a guardian of the child (for example, if he and the mother are not married), he does not have an automatic right to give, or to withhold, consent for adoption . However, he is entitled to be consulted about the adoption of his child. He can also make an application for guardianship so that he can withhold his consent.\n\nIf you (the birth father) are concerned that your partner or former partner plans to place your child for adoption without letting you know, you can ask the Adoption Authority of Ireland to notify you. To do this, you must record your details recorded on the Birth Father Register (pdf) . You can do this before your child is born, if necessary. This register is checked against all applications for adoption.\n\nRelevant non-guardians\n\nRelevant non-guardians have a right to be consulted about an adoption. A relevant non-guardian is a person who is recognised as the parent of a child, but who is not a legal guardian. A relevant non-guardian may also be a type of guardian who does not have the right to consent to an adoption.\n\nIf you are a relevant non-guardian and you are concerned that your child may be placed for adoption without your knowledge, you can register your details with the Adoption Authority of Ireland (pdf) . They will check the register against all applications for adoption.\n\nWhat if the mother cannot (or will not) consent?\n\nIf a mother or guardian cannot (or will not) consent to a proposed adoption, the adoption can only proceed by an order of the High Court.\n\nIn this case, Tusla or the adopters must apply to the Court. They must prove that the child\u2019s parents have failed in their duty to the child, and that this failure can be considered legally as an abandonment of their parental rights and duties.\n\nFor this application to be made, the case must first be heard before the Board of the Adoption Authority of Ireland. Read the rules for these hearings on the Adoption Authority of Ireland's website .\n\nCan the birth mother (or guardian) change their mind?Document 6:::\nCan the birth mother (or guardian) change their mind?\n\nIf the mother or guardian withdraws (takes back) their consent after the child has been placed for adoption, the adopters may apply to the High Court for an order. If the court is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the child, it will make an order giving custody of the child to the adopting parents for a specified period. The court can also authorise the Adoption Authority of Ireland to dispense with the mother's (or guardian's) consent to the making of the adoption order.\n\nIf a mother changes her mind about adoption before the adoption order is made, but the adopting parents refuse to give up the child, she can begin legal proceedings to have custody of her child returned to her.\n\nEmployment rights of adoptive parents\n\nAn adoptive parent is entitled to take adoptive leave from employment. Adoptive leave gives 24 weeks\u2019 leave off work to one parent of the adopting couple (or a parent who is adopting alone). The 24 weeks start from the date the child is placed in your care.\n\nAdoptive parents are also entitled to 9 weeks\u2019 parent\u2019s leave within 2 years of the child being placed with the family.\n\nYou may also be entitled to take parental leave , to spend time looking after your children. You can take up to 26 weeks\u2019 parental leave for each eligible child before their 12th birthday.\n\nLaws on adoption and the organisations involved\n\nThe Adoption Act 2010 merged, consolidated and updated all existing adoption laws in Ireland. This Act was revised further by the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017. Read about these key pieces of legislation in the table below:\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: Who can adopt a child in Ireland?\nA:\n\nYou must be at least 21 years of age to adopt a child under Irish law. There is no Irish legal upper age limit for adopting parents but age is a factor in determining suitability here.\n\nYou must also:\n\n* Have a valid 'declaration of eligibility and suitability'\n* Be \u2018habitually resident in the State\u2019, which means Ireland has become your home. Living in Ireland for at least one year before the date of the making of the adoption order would generally be sufficient.\n\nYour relationship status does not necessarily impact your eligibility to adopt a child. This means you are eligible to adopt if you are:\n\n* A married couple\n* A couple living together in a civil partnership\n* A couple cohabiting together in a relationship for at least 3 years (living together but not married or in a civil partnership)\n* A sole applicant who is not in one of the categories listed above (only where the Adoption Authority is satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is desirable and in the best interests of the child)\n\nYou may also be eligible to adopt if you are the mother, father or relative of the child. \u2018Relative\u2019 means a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the child (or the spouse of any such person), with the relationship to the child being traced through either the mother or the father.",

There are different types of domestic adoption, for example, step-parent adoption and long-term foster care adoption .\n\nThis page explains the different types of domestic adoption, the steps involved in the adoption process, and the rules about who can adopt a child in Ireland.\n\nYou may also want to read our page about intercountry adoption , which is where you adopt a child from abroad.\n\nTypes of domestic adoption\n\nDomestic adoption is when you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland. There are different types of domestic adoption:\n\nStep-parent adoption\n\nStep-parent adoption is where you apply to adopt your partner\u2019s child.\n\nYour partner can consent (agree) to the adoption and still keep their own parental rights and responsibilities. In a step-parent adoption, you and your partner share parenting duties once the adoption order is made. Read about adoption orders in the section \u2018Steps involved in adopting a child\u2019, below.\n\nThe child must have lived with their parent and you (the prospective step- parent) together, for a minimum of 2 years .\n\nExtended family adoption\n\nAn extended family adoption is where a member of the child\u2019s family (or a relative), adopts the child. The child would have been placed with them by the birth mother or by the Tusla childcare system.\n\nDomestic infant adoption\n\nDomestic infant adoption is where a child is placed with an alternative set of parents. The child is placed with the couple by the Tusla adoption service or an accredited adoption agency. The Adoption Authority of Ireland must approve the placement before it takes place.\n\nLong term foster care adoption\n\nFoster care adoption is when a couple adopt a child who was originally placed with them in a foster care situation.\n\nFind more information on the different types of domestic adoption on the Adoption Authority of Ireland\u2019s website.\n\nWho can adopt a child in Ireland?",

If you adopt a child who is resident in Ireland, it is called domestic adoption .\n\nWhen you adopt a child, they become a member of your family. Adoption creates a legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the child.\n\nAs intercountry adoption is a complex legal process, you should get legal advice from a solicitor who specialises in intercountry adoption. See 'More information about intercountry adoption' below.\n\nWho can adopt?\n\nYou must be at least 21 years of age to adopt a child under Irish law. There is no Irish legal upper age limit for adopting parents but age is a factor in determining suitability here.\n\nYou must also:\n\nHave a valid 'declaration of eligibility and suitability' (see 'Being assessed for eligibility to adopt' below)\n\nBe \u2018habitually resident in the State\u2019, which means Ireland has become your home. Living in Ireland for at least one year before the date of the making of the adoption order would generally be sufficient.\n\nYour relationship status does not necessarily impact your eligibility to adopt a child. This means you are eligible to adopt if you are:\n\nA married couple\n\nA couple living together in a civil partnership\n\nA couple cohabiting together in a relationship for at least 3 years (living together but not married or in a civil partnership)\n\nA sole applicant who is not in one of the categories listed above (only where the Adoption Authority is satisfied that, in the particular circumstances of the case, it is desirable and in the best interests of the child)\n\nYou may also be eligible to adopt if you are the mother, father or relative of the child. \u2018Relative\u2019 means a grandparent, brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the child (or the spouse of any such person), with the relationship to the child being traced through either the mother or the father.",

You will need to show this letter to an immigration officer when you return to Ireland.\n\nSteps to take once the child arrives in Ireland\n\nTell the Adoption Authority that the child has arrived\n\nYou must tell the Adoption Authority of Ireland and Tusla when you bring the child to Ireland for the first time after adoption in the country of origin. Find contact details in the section \u2018More information about intercountry adoption\u2019 below.\n\nYou must also tell the Adoption Authority and Tusla if you have brought the child to Ireland, in order to adopt the child through domestic adoption .\n\nYou must do this within 3 months of the child arriving in Ireland.\n\nRegister the adoption in Ireland\n\nIf the child was adopted in the country of origin, the final step in the intercountry adoption process is the registration of the adoption. This is the formal, legal recognition of the adoption by the Irish State.\n\nYou must complete and submit an application for registration of the adoption (pdf) to the Adoption Authority within 3 months of re-entering Ireland following the adoption.\n\nThe Adoption Authority can register the adoption in the \u2018Register of Intercountry Adoptions\u2019, on the basis of an \u2018Article 23 certificate\u2019. An Article 23 certificate is a certificate of assurance from the child\u2019s country of origin that proves the adoption was carried out in compliance with the Hague Convention.\n\nGetting an adoption certificate\n\nWhen the adoption has been registered, it will appear on the Register of Intercountry Adoptions. The register has details of the adopted child and the adoptive parents. It is a public register and is open to scrutiny by members of the public.",

The declaration is like a \u2018license to adopt\u2019, and may include the age and health status of a child whom you are considered suitable to parent (based on the information in the assessment report).\n\nThe Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability is granted for a period of 2 years from the date it is issued . If your declaration is about to expire, you can apply to have it extended by a further 1 year , provided there have been no changes in your circumstances.\n\nIf your circumstances have changed (for example, you moved home or your health status has changed), you must tell the Adoption Authority of Ireland in writing . Read more about what to do if your situation has changed under the heading \u2018Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability\u2019 on the Adoption Authority\u2019s website.\n\nThe \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 are considered\n\nThe Adoption Authority of Ireland always puts the best interests of the child first. The Authority will consider:\n\nThe child\u2019s age and maturity\n\nThe physical, psychological and emotional needs of the child\n\nThe likely effect of adoption on the child\n\nThe child\u2019s views on their proposed adoption\n\nThe child\u2019s social, intellectual and educational needs\n\nThe child\u2019s upbringing and care\n\nThe child\u2019s relationship with their parent, guardian or relative as the case may be\n\nAny other circumstances affecting the child\n\nAn adoption order is made\n\nAn adoption order is a legal document, issued by the Adoption Authority of Ireland. It confirms that the child is, by law, a member of their new family. When an adoption order is issued, the child is legally regarded as the child of the adoptive parents, as if they were born to them.\n\nThe period of time between the granting of the declaration of eligibility and suitability to the making of an adoption order differs from one case to another depending on the type of adoption application being made and the particular circumstances of the applicants and the child.\n\nIn the case of a step-parent adoption where the child is in situ, it is expected that the application for the adoption order will progress during the lifespan of the declaration of eligibility and suitability.",

If you commit a motoring offence , and the penalty for the offence includes penalty points, your driving licence will be endorsed with one or more penalty points.\n\nSome traffic offences have other penalties, such as fines as well as penalty points.\n\nThe penalty points system for driving offences has operated in Ireland since 2002. The law governing penalty points is the Road Traffic Act 2002 . This legislation has been amended a number of times to add offences for which penalty points can be issued.\n\nWhile penalty points are endorsed on your driving licence, the points do not physically appear on the licence. Your penalty points are recorded on your driving licence record, which is held on the National Vehicle and Driver File operated by the Department of Transport.\n\nPenalty point endorsements remain on your licence record for 3 years and must be notified to your insurance company when applying for motor insurance.

In most cases, a Garda will issue you with a fixed charge notice setting out the fine payable and you have the option of paying the fixed charge and accepting the associated period of disqualification or allowing the matter to proceed to court.\n\nFor example, if you hold a valid licence or learner permit at the time of committing a drink driving offence and your alcohol level is below a certain limit, you may be issued with a fixed charge. If you pay the fine stated on the notice within 28 days, the disqualification order associated with the offence will be imposed but you will not have to go to court.\n\nHowever, the Garda\u00ed do have the power to arrest you for some offences, such as drink driving or dangerous driving, and a small number of very serious offences result in automatic summons to court without the option of paying a fixed charge.\n\nYou can find out more about how criminal trials work. You can also read about criminal legal aid and the services available from Free Legal Advice Centres (FLAC) and Citizen Information Services .\n\nSurrendering your licence\n\nDepending on the type of disqualification order made by the court (for more, see 'Types of disqualification orders'), you will be required to surrender your licence to the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) within 10 or 14 days of the order commencing.\n\nUpon receiving your licence, the NDLS updates your driver record to reflect the fact that your licence has been received. If it is not received, no amendment is made. Upon being disqualified from driving, your record will also be updated on the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF) . The NDLS retain your driving licence until the expiration of your period of disqualification, or until the removal of your disqualification order, and return it to you.Document 6:::\nDisc parking : lets you pay for parking by buying a parking disc in a participating newsagents or shop. The disc should be displayed clearly on your windscreen. This service runs in some cities and smaller towns.\n\nPermit parking\n\nIf there is on-street parking in operation on the street where you live, you can get a resident's permit from the traffic division of your local authority to park there. Your permit identifies the name of your street and varies in price depending on your location. Each car owner can be issued with one permit, and no more than four permits are issued to applicants of any one household. If you live in a house that has been divided up into more than one unit of accommodation, you are only entitled to one parking permit per unit. Residents of purpose built apartment blocks are not eligible for residents' permits.\n\nPrivate car parks\n\nPrivate car parks are not regulated by the Government and revenue earned from parking there goes directly to the owners of the car parks. The prices charged in private car parks vary. Prices are determined by the car park owner. You will usually be issued a ticket when you go into the car park and pay for parking when you leave.\n\nParking restrictions\n\nParking is restricted during business hours in certain parts of most towns and cities. During these hours, you are not allowed to obstruct clearways, bus lanes and loading zones. Parking signs on these streets will clearly display the hours that restrictions are in operation. Disabled parking spaces are off limits at all times, unless you have an appropriate permit. See our page on Parking Permits for Disabled Drivers .\n\nParking fines\n\nThere is a system of fines in place for illegal parking and non-payment of parking fees. You get a parking ticket when you have been issued a fine.\n\nIf you get a parking fine, you must pay the fine to the traffic division of the local authority within 28 days of the date of the fixed charge notice. If you fail to pay within the allotted 28 days, the charge increases by 50%. If the fine is unpaid after a further 28 days, court proceedings are initiated. Details of where you can pay your parking fine should be written on your parking ticket. If you fail to pay your parking fine and aren\u2019t formally appealing the fine, you can be prosecuted.\n\nPenalty points\n\nSome parking offences incur penalty points. For example, if you are convicted of parking dangerously, you will receive 5 penalty points and a fine. Read more about the penalty points system .\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: How do penalty points work?\nA:\nPenalty points are recorded on your driving licence when you are convicted in court of a driving offence that attracts penalty points or you pay a fixed charge notice that was issued to you for an offence that also carries penalty points.

If you commit a motoring offence , and the penalty for the offence includes penalty points, your driving licence will be endorsed with one or more penalty points.\n\nSome traffic offences have other penalties, such as fines as well as penalty points.\n\nThe penalty points system for driving offences has operated in Ireland since 2002. The law governing penalty points is the Road Traffic Act 2002 . This legislation has been amended a number of times to add offences for which penalty points can be issued.\n\nWhile penalty points are endorsed on your driving licence, the points do not physically appear on the licence. Your penalty points are recorded on your driving licence record, which is held on the National Vehicle and Driver File operated by the Department of Transport.\n\nPenalty point endorsements remain on your licence record for 3 years and must be notified to your insurance company when applying for motor insurance. Motor insurance companies have had access to the National Vehicle and Driver File since 2014.\n\nEndorsements on your licence record will often lead to an increase in your motor insurance premium.\n\nHow do penalty points work?\n\nPenalty points are recorded on your driving licence when:\n\nYou are convicted in court of a driving offence that attracts penalty points or\n\nYou pay a fixed charge notice that was issued to you for an offence that also carries penalty points\n\nIf you get 12 penalty points in any 3 year period, you are automatically disqualified from driving for 6 months.\n\nLearner permit drivers are disqualified if they have 7 penalty points. This lower threshold also applies for the first 2 years of a driver\u2019s first full driving licence.\n\nPenalty points are not added to your licence immediately.\n\nFixed charge and penalty offences\n\nFixed notice penalties are issued for driving offences that attract penalty points and/or just a fine.",

                    "Examples of how penalty points and fines are awarded.\n\nSpeeding offences : A fixed charge fine of \u20ac160, together with 3 penalty points. If you have been caught speeding on a police traffic camera, you will get a notice of your fine and penalty points for the offence by post. You have 28 days in which to pay your fine from the date the notice is issued to you. If you do not pay your fine, the fine then increases to \u20ac240, which you must pay within 28 days. If after this time (56 days) you still have not paid your fine, the offence is referred to the courts. If you are convicted in court of speeding offences and non-payment of fines, you will automatically receive 5 penalty points and a fine up to a maximum of \u20ac1,000.\n\nSeatbelt offences : If you drive without a seatbelt or allow children under 17 years to travel in your car without a seatbelt, you will incur a fixed charge fine of \u20ac120. You must pay this fine within 28 days or face an increased fine of \u20ac180 payable within 56 days of the offence. 3 penalty points will be added to your licence if you pay the fine on time. If you are convicted in court for non-wearing of a seatbelt, 5 penalty points will be added to your licence and you will be liable to a \u20ac2,000 fine for a first offence. Read more about seatbelts and the law in Ireland .\n\nMotor insurance offences : If you drive without insurance, you will get 5 penalty points and will have to appear in court. The court can issue a fine of up to \u20ac5,000 and can send you to prison for up to 6 months. The court can disqualify you from driving instead of issuing penalty points.\n\nCareless driving : If you drive \u2018a vehicle in a public place without due care and attention' you can get up to 5 penalty points on your licence and a fine of up to \u20ac5,000. If careless driving causes death or serious bodily harm, you are liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term of up to 2 years or to a fine of up to \u20ac10,000 or to both.\n\nOther penalty point questions\n\nWhat happens if someone else was driving my vehicle?",
                    "Penalty points are not added to your licence immediately.\n\nFixed charge and penalty offences\n\nFixed notice penalties are issued for driving offences that attract penalty points and/or just a fine.\n\nIf you receive a fixed notice penalty, you will be issued a notice by the Department of Transport. If you pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you will get a further notice from the Department of Transport confirming that the penalty points will be added to your driving licence. The penalty points will be added to your licence 28 days after that.\n\nIf you do not pay the fixed charge fine within 56 days, you will get a summons to appear in the District Court. If you are convicted of a driving offence in court, the court will notify the Department of Transport of the number of penalty points attached to that conviction. The Department of Transport will then issue a notification that these penalty points will be added to your driving licence 28 days after the notification date.\n\nYou can get information on fixed charge notices and fines in our document on driving offences .\n\nHow long do penalty points stay on my licence?\n\nPenalty points remain on your licence record for 3 years. Any period where your licence is out of date or you are serving a court disqualification does not count as part of the 3 years.\n\nIf you accumulate 12 points or 7 where applicable and are disqualified from driving for 6 months, the points which led to the disqualification are removed at the end of the 6 months.\n\nBut if you had more offences that had not been endorsed on your licence record by the time you started your 6 month suspension, these extra points would be added to your licence record and would remain on your licence for 3 years (from the time your licence was reinstated).\n\nWhat happens to my licence if I have 12 penalty points or 7 where\n\napplicable?\n\nIf you have been notified by the Department of Transport that you have been disqualified from driving because you have reached 12 penalty points or more, you must surrender your driving licence to the National Driver Licence Service for the period of 6 months.\n\nWhat motoring offences result in penalty points?\n\nThe Road Traffic Act 2002, (as amended) legislates for motoring offences that incur penalty points.

This offence can carry very large fines and possible imprisonment. However, if a genuine mistake has been made, it is possible to apply for planning permission to retain an unauthorised development. This permission can be refused, in which case, the unauthorised development will have to be demolished.\n\nTypes of planning permission\n\nThere are 2 types of planning permission:\n\nPermission\n\nOutline permission\n\nThe most common type of planning permission is permission , which is sometimes called full permission. This is where the local authority agrees to your work. Permission is normally subject to conditions, some of which may require changes to your proposals. Planning permission normally lasts for 5 years.\n\nOutline permission is where you apply to see if the local authority agrees in principle with you building a house or large extension. When applying for outline permission, you only need certain plans and details about your proposal. You need to produce enough for the planning authority to make a decision about the siting, layout or other proposals for development. Generally, outline permission last for 3 years. If you get outline permission, you will then have to submit detailed drawings and get consequent permission before you start building work.\n\nYou must not start building before you get planning permission.\n\nHow much does it cost to apply for planning permission?\n\nYou have to pay a fee with your planning application. Different fees apply to different types of development. For example, the current fee for an application to build a house is \u20ac65. The fee for a house extension or the conversion of a garage for use as part of a house is \u20ac34.\n\nBefore you apply for planning permission\n\nBefore applying for planning permission you must give public notice of your proposals. You do this by:\n\nPutting a notice in a local newspaper (your local authority will have a list), and\n\nPutting up a site notice that can be clearly seen and read\n\nYou will find details of information that must be contained in the notices in the planning application form. Your planning application must be received by the local authority within 2 weeks of the notice appearing in the local newspaper and the site notice going up.\n\nNote:Document 4:::\nHow to apply\n\nApplying for planning permission\n\nIf you need to get planning permission you fill in a planning permission form, which is available on your local authority's website . Submit the completed form and the required documents to the Planning Department of your local authority . For new short-term letting use you should apply for planning permission, whereas for existing unauthorised use you must apply for retention permission. It normally takes about 8 weeks to process an application.\n\nWhen making its decision on a planning application about short-term letting the planning authority will take a number of things into account, such as whether the area is experiencing high housing demand, high rent inflation, insufficient supply and lots of planning applications for short-term lets. It should be noted that if this is the case, it is unlikely that planning permission will be granted.\n\nYou can appeal a planning permission decision to An Bord Plean\u00e1la . For more information on how to do this, read An Bord Plean\u00e1la\u2019s Guide to making a Planning Appeal .\n\nRegistering with the local authority\n\nIf you are offering short-term lettings in an RPZ area, but are exempt from the planning permission requirement, you still need to register with the local authority to avail of this exemption.\n\nYou must complete the following forms and provide any additional documents needed and send them to your local authority within the required time limits.\n\nForm 15 \u2013 Start of year notification form. This form should be sent to your local authority within 4 weeks of the start of each year, and no later than 2 weeks before the first short-term let of the year for that property.\n\nForm 17 \u2013 End of year notification form. This should be sent to your local authority between the 1 and 28 January of the year after the lettings have taken place.\n\nForm 16 \u2013 90 day threshold notification form. This should only be sent to your local authority if you are a homeowner temporarily away from your home and reach the 90 day threshold during the year. You should submit the form no more than 2 weeks after the 90 day threshold has been reached.\n\nYou will have to provide documentation proving that the property is your principal private residence.\n\nThese registration forms are available on your local authority's website and they can be sent by email or post.

                    "What happens if I need planning permission but don\u2019t apply for it or get\n\nit?\n\nIt is an offence to do work that requires planning permission, without having planning permission. This offence can carry very large fines and possible imprisonment. However, if a genuine mistake has been made, it is possible to apply for planning permission to retain an unauthorised development. This permission can be refused, in which case, the unauthorised development will have to be demolished.\n\nTypes of planning permission\n\nThere are 2 types of planning permission:\n\nPermission\n\nOutline permission\n\nThe most common type of planning permission is permission , which is sometimes called full permission. This is where the local authority agrees to your work. Permission is normally subject to conditions, some of which may require changes to your proposals. Planning permission normally lasts for 5 years.\n\nOutline permission is where you apply to see if the local authority agrees in principle with you building a house or large extension. When applying for outline permission, you only need certain plans and details about your proposal. You need to produce enough for the planning authority to make a decision about the siting, layout or other proposals for development. Generally, outline permission last for 3 years. If you get outline permission, you will then have to submit detailed drawings and get consequent permission before you start building work.\n\nYou must not start building before you get planning permission.\n\nHow much does it cost to apply for planning permission?\n\nYou have to pay a fee with your planning application. Different fees apply to different types of development. For example, the current fee for an application to build a house is \u20ac65. The fee for a house extension or the conversion of a garage for use as part of a house is \u20ac34.\n\nBefore you apply for planning permission\n\nBefore applying for planning permission you must give public notice of your proposals. You do this by:\n\nPutting a notice in a local newspaper (your local authority will have a list), and\n\nPutting up a site notice that can be clearly seen and read\n\nYou will find details of information that must be contained in the notices in the planning application form. Your planning application must be received by the local authority within 2 weeks of the notice appearing in the local newspaper and the site notice going up.\n\nNote:",
                    "How to apply\n\nApplying for planning permission\n\nIf you need to get planning permission you fill in a planning permission form, which is available on your local authority's website . Submit the completed form and the required documents to the Planning Department of your local authority . For new short-term letting use you should apply for planning permission, whereas for existing unauthorised use you must apply for retention permission. It normally takes about 8 weeks to process an application.\n\nWhen making its decision on a planning application about short-term letting the planning authority will take a number of things into account, such as whether the area is experiencing high housing demand, high rent inflation, insufficient supply and lots of planning applications for short-term lets. It should be noted that if this is the case, it is unlikely that planning permission will be granted.\n\nYou can appeal a planning permission decision to An Bord Plean\u00e1la . For more information on how to do this, read An Bord Plean\u00e1la\u2019s Guide to making a Planning Appeal .\n\nRegistering with the local authority\n\nIf you are offering short-term lettings in an RPZ area, but are exempt from the planning permission requirement, you still need to register with the local authority to avail of this exemption.\n\nYou must complete the following forms and provide any additional documents needed and send them to your local authority within the required time limits.\n\nForm 15 \u2013 Start of year notification form. This form should be sent to your local authority within 4 weeks of the start of each year, and no later than 2 weeks before the first short-term let of the year for that property.\n\nForm 17 \u2013 End of year notification form. This should be sent to your local authority between the 1 and 28 January of the year after the lettings have taken place.\n\nForm 16 \u2013 90 day threshold notification form. This should only be sent to your local authority if you are a homeowner temporarily away from your home and reach the 90 day threshold during the year. You should submit the form no more than 2 weeks after the 90 day threshold has been reached.\n\nYou will have to provide documentation proving that the property is your principal private residence.\n\nThese registration forms are available on your local authority's website and they can be sent by email or post. Dublin City Council also has an online application option .\n\nWhere to apply for planning permission\n\nApply to your local authority for planning permission."

As a result, they are not strictly binding.

Therefore, in situations where one party is likely to inherit a significant family farm or business, it will guide the judge in the divorce or judicial separation on what the parties\u2019 intentions were at the outset.\n\nDrafting a pre-nuptial agreement\n\nOnly pre-nuptial agreements entered into following independent legal advice for both parties are likely to be taken into account. The court would have to be satisfied that there had been a complete disclosure of assets before the agreement was signed. It is also advisable for the agreement to provide for reviews:\n\nPeriodically (for example, every five years)\n\nIf children are born\n\nIf there is a major change in circumstances (for example, assets are purchased or sold)\n\nThe agreement should be in writing, be signed by each party and comply with the rules of contract law.\n\nThe future of pre-nuptial agreementsDocument 1:::\nYou must notify the personal representative of the deceased of your application for provision from the deceased\u2019s estate within 6 months of an application for a grant of probate .\n\nIn general, if your cohabiting relationship ended two years or more before your ex-partner died, you cannot apply for provision from the estate unless you were getting regular or periodic payments from the deceased.\n\nWhat is a cohabitation agreement?\n\nIf you live with your partner but you do not intend to marry, you should protect your financial interests by entering into a \u2018 cohabitation agreement \u2019 (also called a cohabitant\u2019s agreement). This is a voluntary, signed agreement, which allows you to specify the day-to-day joint financial arrangements of your relationship, such as:\n\nThe payment of joint debts\n\nThe payment of common household expenses\n\nYou can also specify how you plan to separate your assets, such as shared property, should the relationship come to an end. In the event of a break-up, a cohabitation agreement can make the division of your assets more straightforward.\n\nYour cohabitation agreement may include a provision that the redress scheme does not apply to you (for example, you can both agree not to apply for a maintenance order should your relationship end). This is different from similar agreements by married couples. Agreements between married couples cannot exclude either party\u2019s right to apply to the courts for various orders (for example, a maintenance order).\n\nIs a cohabitation agreement valid in court?\n\nIf you and your partner make a cohabitation agreement (an agreement on joint financial matters), it is only valid if:\n\nEach of you has had independent legal advice, or you got legal advice together and have waived the right to independent legal advice (see \u2018More information\u2019 below)\n\nThe agreement is a contract\n\nThe agreement has been signed by each of you\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, the court may set aside or vary (change) your cohabitation agreement (for example, if the enforcement of the agreement would cause serious injustice).\n\nIf you and your cohabitant entered into an agreement before the 2010 Act commenced, it is enforceable.\n\nMore information\n\nIf you are concerned about your rights following the breakdown of your cohabiting relationship, you should get legal advice.Document 2:::\nYour executor must inform your spouse or civil partner in writing of their right to choose between these two options. Your spouse or civil partner must ask for their legal right share within 6 months of being notified, or within 12 months of the taking out of the Grant of Representation.\n\nWhere a legal right share does not apply\n\nYour spouse or civil partner can renounce (give up) their rights to the legal right share. This can be part of an agreement before marriage or civil partnership or the spouse or civil partner can give up their rights to benefit their children or other named beneficiaries.\n\nIf there is evidence of undue influence or evidence that the spouse or civil partner did not understand what they were doing, the renunciation may be challenged. It is normally advised that a spouse or civil partner get independent legal advice if renouncing their legal right share.\n\nThe legal right share can be lost where the spouse or civil partner is:\n\nConvicted of the murder, manslaughter or attempted murder of the deceased person\n\nConvicted of an offence against the deceased person or a child that carries a sentence of more than 2 years\n\nDivorce, separation and desertion\n\nSeparation agreements usually include a renunciation of both spouses\u2019 or civil partner\u2019s legal right share.\n\nIf you are divorced or your civil partnership was dissolved, you do not have to provide a legal right share.\n\nIf your spouse or civil partner deserted you for more than 2 years, they are not entitled to a legal right share unless they deserted you as a result of your behaviour (for example, domestic abuse).\n\nCohabiting partners\n\nPartners, who live with each other but are not married or in a civil partnership, have no automatic legal right to each other's estates, although under the redress scheme for cohabiting couples introduced by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 a qualified cohabitant can apply for a share of the estate of a deceased cohabitant.\n\nYou can leave some or all of your estate to your partner but this does not cancel out the legal rights of a spouse or civil partner if you were married before to someone else and did not get divorced or had your civil partnership dissolved.\n\nRights of children under a will\n\nChildren do not have any absolute right to inherit any of their parent's estate if the parent has made a will. Children born inside or outside marriage and adopted children all have the same rights and there are no age restrictions.Document 3:::\nYour name is not on the title deeds but you made contributions to the\n\npurchase of the house\n\nWhether you are married or not, if your name is not on the title deeds to the house, you may still be able to show that you have some ownership rights in relation to the house.\n\nThese rights are based on the fact that you may have made a contribution, (either directly or indirectly), to the purchase price of the house with the intention of gaining a share in the ownership of the house. Usually, if you can show that you made a contribution to the purchase price of the house, you will be entitled to a share in the house in some proportion to your contribution.\n\nFor example, if you paid off half of the mortgage (and the mortgage represented 90% of the purchase price), you may roughly be entitled to 45% of the ownership of the property.\n\nCivil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act\n\n2010\n\nThe Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 sets out certain legal rights and protections that cohabiting couples have, which may allow you seek redress in the courts. To qualify for any redress orders, such as a property adjustment order, cohabiting couples without children have to have lived together in an intimate and committed relationship for 5 years. If you have children together, it is 2 years.\n\nA court will only make such an order if it is satisfied that one partner was financially dependent on the other cohabitant partner.\n\nCohabitation agreements\n\nThe Act also provides for couples to enter into a \"cohabitation agreement\" to set out your financial interests and also determine what will happen with certain assets, such as property, if your relationship should end.\n\nA cohabitant\u2019s agreement can make things more straightforward in the event of a break-up. A court may vary (change aspects of) or set aside a cohabitants\u2019 agreement in exceptional circumstances where enforcing it would cause serious injustice.\n\nWhat if there are children involved?\n\nIf there are children involved, a relationship breakdown can be life-altering. It needs to be handled sensitively to ensure the children\u2019s best interests are prioritised.Document 4:::\nCivil partnership changes your entitlements and obligations regarding:\n\nSocial welfare\n\nTax\n\nLife insurance and pensions\n\nInheritance\n\nMaintenance\n\nShared home\n\nBarring, safety and protection orders\n\nOther consequences of civil partnership\n\nCivil liability: A surviving civil partner may sue for the wrongful death of their civil partner, where the death was caused by the negligence or wrongdoing of another person and has resulted in injury or mental distress to the survivor.\n\nMental health: A civil partner may apply for the involuntary admission to a psychiatric institution of a mentally ill civil partner (provided the parties are not separated and provided the applicant has not been the subject of an application under the Domestic Violence Acts).\n\nPower of attorney: A civil partner must be informed of the registration of an enduring power of attorney. Similarly, an enduring power of attorney in favour of a civil partner is no longer valid if the partnership is dissolved or there is a safety or barring order against the civil partner.\n\nProperty disputes: A civil partner may apply to the courts for a decision in relation to disputes over property with their partner.\n\nTenancies: Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, a civil partner may be able to take over a tenancy on the death of their partner.\n\nFormer spouses who entered into civil partnerships: If you were married to someone and the marriage ended, and then you entered into a civil partnership with someone else, you lose your status as a former spouse. Under divorce legislation, former spouses continue to have the right to go to the courts for maintenance and property orders. However, once a former spouse entered into a civil partnership, this changed. Maintenance orders and pension adjustment orders in favour of a former spouse lapsed if that spouse entered into a civil partnership. A property adjustment order may not be made for the benefit of a former spouse if that spouse has entered into a registered civil partnership.\n\nEnding a civil partnership\n\nWhen a civil partnership breaks down, the civil partners may choose to informally separate and live apart. However, most couples will eventually want to regulate matters between them.\n\nIf a married couple or civil partners can agree the terms on which they will live separately, they may enter into a separation agreement . The agreement is a legally binding contract setting out each party's rights and obligations to the other. The terms of the agreement are usually reached either through mediation or negotiation through solicitors.Document 5:::\nEnglish | Gaeilge\n\nYou are here: Home > Family and Relationships > Cohabiting couples > Living together and marriage: what are the legal differences?\n\nLiving together and marriage: what are the legal differences?\n\nIntroduction\n\nMain legal differences between marriage and living together\n\nPreparing for the future with a cohabitation agreement\n\nRedress scheme for cohabiting couples\n\nGetting advice\n\nFurther information\n\nIntroduction\n\nYour legal rights as a partner depend on whether you are married, in a civil partnership or living together (cohabiting). In general, you have fewer rights if you and your partner are living together than if you're married. It\u2019s important to know the differences and understand how they might impact you.\n\nMain legal differences between marriage and living together\n\nMany couples decide that they do not want to get married for many different reasons. But if you decide to live together, it is important to understand how this might impact you if your relationship breaks down or ends through death. The following table outlines some of the main differences.Document 6:::\nGiven the legal differences between being married and living together, this page signposts you to some of the issues you should consider if you are living with your partner:\n\nProperty rights\n\nProperty rights after the breakdown of a cohabiting relationship\n\nRedress scheme for cohabiting couples\n\nThe legal guardianship of children\n\nThe custody of children\n\nAccess rights relating to children\n\nAdoption\n\nFostering\n\nInheritance rights\n\nMaintenance\n\nCohabitation agreements\n\nRedress scheme for cohabiting couples\n\nIf you have been living with your partner and your relationship ends, you may be able to avail of the Redress scheme for cohabiting couples . The aim of the redress scheme is to protect a financially dependent member of the couple if the long-term cohabiting relationship ends (either through death or separation).\n\nUnder the redress scheme, cohabiting couples can get similar orders from the court as are available to married couples when they separate or divorce if the court is satisfied that one of you was financially dependent on the other. The types of orders you may apply for under the redress scheme include property adjustment orders, maintenance orders and pension adjustment orders.\n\nTo apply for court orders under the redress scheme, you must be a qualified cohabitant. This means you must have been:\n\nLiving together in an intimate and committed relationship for at least 5 years, or\n\nLiving together in an intimate and committed relationship for 2 years if you have had a child with your partner\n\nYou must apply for these orders within two years of your relationship ending, unless there are exceptional circumstances. The rules of the scheme are set out in the Cohabitants are defined in the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 .\n\nInheritance\n\nIn certain circumstances, if your partner dies when you are still in a relationship together, you can apply to the court for a portion of their estate, but it is not necessary to prove that you were financially dependent on them. You must apply within 6 months after the probate or administration is first granted.\n\nIf your relationship ended 2 years or more before the death or your ex- partner, you may only apply to the court for a portion of their estate if you were financially dependent on them, for example, you had been getting a maintenance payment from them, or had applied to the court for a maintenance, property or pension adjustment order.\n\nExample 1:\n\nQ: What documents do I need to apply online for a driver's license in Ireland?\nA: You need a Public Services Card and verified MyGovID, proof of your address if your address is different to the one you provided when you got your Public Services Card, proof that you are normally resident in Ireland if you are not an EU or EEA citizen, a medical report form, dated within one month if required, and a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) for professional drivers.\n\nExample 2:\n\nQ: What criteria do I need to meet to qualify for unemployment benefits in Ireland?\nA: You must be under 66 years of age, or under 70 years and\u202fdeferring your State Pension (Contributory), be unemployed (you must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7), have had a substantial loss of employment and as a result be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7 (this does not apply to casual workers and part-time fire fighters), be capable of work, be available for and genuinely seeking work, and have enough social insurance (PRSI) contributions.\n\nExample 3:\nQ: What is the legal status of pre-nuptial agreements?\nA:\nPre-nuptial agreements have no basis in law in Ireland. As a result, they are not strictly binding. This means that if you have a pre-nuptial agreement in place and you end up in court following the breakdown of your marriage, the judge is not bound by the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nThe only provision in Irish law is under sections 113 and 113A of the Succession Act 1965 (as amended) where a spouse or a civil partner can renounce his/her legal right share in a pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nAlthough they are not legally binding, there is nothing in Irish law which stops a couple planning to marry from having and signing a pre-nuptial agreement. Importantly, such agreements can serve as guides for the courts in judicial separation and divorce cases. If a pre-nuptial agreement makes \u2018proper provision\u2019 for each person it is more likely to be persuasive on the judge.

If you have children together, it is 2 years.\n\nA court will only make such an order if it is satisfied that one partner was financially dependent on the other cohabitant partner.\n\nCohabitation agreements\n\nThe Act also provides for couples to enter into a \"cohabitation agreement\" to set out your financial interests and also determine what will happen with certain assets, such as property, if your relationship should end.\n\nA cohabitant\u2019s agreement can make things more straightforward in the event of a break-up. A court may vary (change aspects of) or set aside a cohabitants\u2019 agreement in exceptional circumstances where enforcing it would cause serious injustice.\n\nWhat if there are children involved?\n\nIf there are children involved, a relationship breakdown can be life-altering. It needs to be handled sensitively to ensure the children\u2019s best interests are prioritised.",
                    "Civil partnership changes your entitlements and obligations regarding:\n\nSocial welfare\n\nTax\n\nLife insurance and pensions\n\nInheritance\n\nMaintenance\n\nShared home\n\nBarring, safety and protection orders\n\nOther consequences of civil partnership\n\nCivil liability: A surviving civil partner may sue for the wrongful death of their civil partner, where the death was caused by the negligence or wrongdoing of another person and has resulted in injury or mental distress to the survivor.\n\nMental health: A civil partner may apply for the involuntary admission to a psychiatric institution of a mentally ill civil partner (provided the parties are not separated and provided the applicant has not been the subject of an application under the Domestic Violence Acts).\n\nPower of attorney: A civil partner must be informed of the registration of an enduring power of attorney. Similarly, an enduring power of attorney in favour of a civil partner is no longer valid if the partnership is dissolved or there is a safety or barring order against the civil partner.\n\nProperty disputes: A civil partner may apply to the courts for a decision in relation to disputes over property with their partner.\n\nTenancies: Under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, a civil partner may be able to take over a tenancy on the death of their partner.\n\nFormer spouses who entered into civil partnerships: If you were married to someone and the marriage ended, and then you entered into a civil partnership with someone else, you lose your status as a former spouse. Under divorce legislation, former spouses continue to have the right to go to the courts for maintenance and property orders. However, once a former spouse entered into a civil partnership, this changed. Maintenance orders and pension adjustment orders in favour of a former spouse lapsed if that spouse entered into a civil partnership. A property adjustment order may not be made for the benefit of a former spouse if that spouse has entered into a registered civil partnership.\n\nEnding a civil partnership\n\nWhen a civil partnership breaks down, the civil partners may choose to informally separate and live apart. However, most couples will eventually want to regulate matters between them.\n\nIf a married couple or civil partners can agree the terms on which they will live separately, they may enter into a separation agreement . The agreement is a legally binding contract setting out each party's rights and obligations to the other. The terms of the agreement are usually reached either through mediation or negotiation through solicitors."

So, for example, there may be changes in how certain aspects of custody and maintenance applications are processed when one parent lives in the EU and one parent lives in the UK. The old basis for recognising UK divorces has also changed although they will still be recognised in Ireland under new rules.\n\nParental responsibility issues such as custody and access\n\nAny cross-border custody or access orders that were in place at the end of the transition period remain in effect. So, orders affecting a child with parents/guardians in both Ireland and the UK are unaffected. If you had an ongoing case about arrangements for your children at the end of the transition period, your case will continue under the old rules.\n\nHowever, if you applied for custody or access after the end of the transition period, different rules may apply for having the order made or accepted in Ireland or the UK. In general, cross-border parental responsibility issues involving Ireland and the UK will be governed by the 1996 Hague Protection of Children Convention . This is similar to the system which existed before Brexit and which already applies to parental responsibility matters with a link to Ireland and to some non-EU countries such as Australia and Russia.\n\nUseful addresses\n\nCentral Authority for Maintenance Recovery\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\n51 St Stephen's Green Dublin 2 D02 HK52 Ireland\n\nTel: +353 (0)1 859 2232\n\nEmail: mainrecov@justice.ie\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\n51 St Stephen's Green Dublin 2 D02 HK52 Ireland\n\nTel: +353 1 4790278\n\nHomepage: https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/505a0-international-child- abduction/\n\nEmail: internationalchildabduction@justice.ie\n\n_Page edited: 5 August 2022 _\n\nRelated documents\n\nCompensation for overbooked, cancelled and delayed flights in the EU\n\nAir passengers have specific consumer rights.
